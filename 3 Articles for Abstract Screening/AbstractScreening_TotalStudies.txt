T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration versus canal wall up mastoidectomy in primary cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare disease recidivism rates between canal wall up mastoidectomy and a canal wall down with obliteration technique.METHODS: Patients undergoing primary cholesteatoma surgery at our institution over a five-year period (2013-2017) using the aforementioned techniques were eligible for inclusion in the study. Rates of discharge and disease recidivism were analysed using chi-square statistics.RESULTS: A total of 104 ears (98 patients) were included. The mean follow-up period was 30 months (range, 12-52 months). A canal wall down with mastoid obliteration technique was performed in 55 cases and a canal wall up approach was performed in 49 cases. Disease recidivism rates were 7.3 per cent and 16.3 per cent in the canal wall down with mastoid obliteration and canal wall up groups respectively (p = 0.02), whilst discharge rates were similar (7.3 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively).CONCLUSION: Our direct comparative data suggest that canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration is superior to a canal wall up technique in primary cholesteatoma surgery, providing a lower recidivism rate combined with a low post-operative ear discharge rate.

T1  - The evaluation of canal wall up cholesteatoma surgery with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after canal wall up cholesteatoma surgery, using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).METHODS: Data from a consecutive group of 47 adults scheduled for primary cholesteatoma surgery using canal wall up (CWU) with obliteration, from January 2005 to December 2009, were analysed. Information was extracted from a medical database, and complementary data from patient files and audiograms were collected and recorded retrospectively. The GBI questionnaire was used for the assessment of HRQoL after surgery.RESULTS: There was no finding of residual or recurrent cholesteatomas in the study group. Hearing was improved at 1 and 3 years postoperatively. No patient suffered a total hearing loss. The overall GBI scores showed an improved HRQoL after surgery. Twenty-nine (85%) patients benefitted from surgery, 1 (3%) had no change, and 4 (12%) expressed deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma surgery using CWU with obliteration gives an improved HRQoL for the majority of patients. The GBI questionnaire provides complementary information to hearing and healing results after cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Influence of surgical technique on residual cholesteatoma location and prevalence
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compared to canal wall up (CWU) tympanoplasty, canal wall reconstruction (CWR) allows better visualization of cholesteatoma extension. The canal wall up approach provides good functional outcomes, but with higher rates of residual cholesteatoma. The aim of this study was to compare residual cholesteatoma prevalence and location between the two approaches.METHOD: Subjects were adult patients with residual cholesteatoma following CWU or CWR surgery between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. During this period, 94 patients underwent CWU and 71 CWR; 22 presented with residual cholesteatoma: 16 after CWU (R-CWU group) and 6 after CWR (R-CWR group).RESULTS: There was no significant inter-group difference in residual cholesteatoma prevalence: 17% after CWU, 8.4% after CWR. Locations comprised: 13 (81%) in the attic, 9 (56%) in the tympanic cavity and 4 (25%) in the mastoid in the R-CWU group, and 6 (100%) in the attic in the R-CWR group. There were significantly fewer tympanic cavity locations after CWR compared to CWU (P=0.046).CONCLUSION: Residual cholesteatoma prevalence did not significantly differ between the CWU and CWR approaches. The most frequent location was the attic; significantly more locations were in the tympanic cavity with the CWU approach. These findings are important for surgeons and neuro-radiologists during follow-up. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - Identification of risk factors for residual cholesteatoma in children and adults: a retrospective study on 110 cases of revision surgery
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Residual disease after cholesteatoma removal is still a challenge for the otorhinolaryngologist. Scheduled "second-look" surgery and, more recently, radiological screenings are used to identify residual cholesteatoma as early as possible. However, these procedures are cost-intensive and are accompanied by discomfort and risks for the patient.OBJECTIVE: To identify anamnestic, clinical, and surgery-related risk factors for residual cholesteatoma.METHODS: The charts of 108 patients, including children as well as adults, having undergone a second-look or revision surgery after initial cholesteatoma removal at a tertiary referral hospital, were analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS: Gender, age, mastoid pneumatization, prior ventilation tube insertion, congenital cholesteatoma, erosion of ossicles, atticotomy, resection of chorda tympani, different reconstruction materials, and postoperative otorrhea did not emerge as statistically significant risk factors for residual disease. However, prior adenoid removal, cholesteatoma growth to the sinus tympani and to the antrum and mastoid, canal-wall-up 2 ways approach, and postoperative retraction and perforation were associated with a statistically higher rate of residual disease. A Type A tympanogram as well as canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach for extended epitympanic and for extended epitympanic and mesotympanic cholesteatomas were associated with statistically lower rates of residual disease. A score including the postoperative retraction or perforation of the tympanic membrane, the quality of the postoperative tympanogram and the intraoperative extension of the cholesteatoma to the sinus tympani and/or the antrum was elaborated and proved to be suitable for predicting residual cholesteatoma with acceptable sensitivity and high specificity.CONCLUSION: Cholesteatoma extension to the sinus tympani, antrum and mastoid makes a residual disease more likely. The canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach seems safe with similar rates of residual cholesteatoma and without the known disadvantages of canal-wall-down surgery. The described score can be useful for identifying patients who need a postoperative radiological control and a second-look surgery.

T1  - Cautionary Findings for the Presence of Facial Canal Dehiscence During Cholesteatoma Surgery
AB  - Our aim was to investigate the relationship between facial canal dehiscence (FCD) and surgical findings and procedures in patients with cholesteatoma. A total of 186 patients (118 males, 39.2 +/- 15 years) who underwent surgery for advanced cholesteatoma between 2013 and 2018 were included in the study. The relationship between FCD and surgical findings was investigated via the surgical registries. The prevalence of FCD was 36.6% (68/186). The prevalence of FCD was 44%, and 13.2% for the patients who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy (62/141) and canal wall up mastoidectomy (6/45), respectively (P < .001). Facial canal dehiscence was detected in 73.9% of the 23 patients who had a lateral semicircular canal (LSCC) defect (P < .001), in 61.9% of 21 patients who had a tegmen tympani defect, and in 58.1% of the 31 patients who had erosion on the posterior wall of the external auditory canal (EAC; P < .05). The prevalence of FCD was 3.1% in patients with isolated incus erosion, 59.1% in patients with erosion of malleus and incus, 60.7% in patients with erosion of stapes suprastructure and incus, and 43.2% in patients with whole ossicular chain deformation (P < .001). The defects on LSCC, EAC, tegmen tympani, and malleus and incus might be cautionary findings for the presence of FCD during cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Evaluation of Type III Tympanoplasty Using Cartilage Ossiculoplasty in Cholesteatoma Ear Surgery
AB  - This prospective observational study evaluates the role of tympanoplasty type III in cholesteatoma ear disease during same sitting with mastoid surgery using cartilage ossiculoplasty. Forty patients of chronic suppurative otitis media-cholesteatoma disease were recruited in the study. All the patients had extensive cholesteatoma and underwent canal wall down mastoid surgery. Tympanoplasty type III, that is, stapes columella, minor columella, or major columella, was done in each case along with mastoid surgery depending upon the remnant ossicular status. Conchal cartilage graft was used for ossiculoplasty along with temporalis fascia graft. Hearing and graft uptake results were evaluated at the end of 6 months postoperatively. Of the 40 cases, 3 cases failed tympanoplasty. In the remaining 37 cases, a statistically significant hearing improvement (air-bone gap of 33 dB) was observed postoperatively. Seven cases underwent stapes columella, 13 cases underwent minor columella, and 17 cases underwent major columella tympanoplasty type III. Although a hearing improvement was recorded in all these subgroups, a statistically significant hearing gain was present only in tympanoplasty type III minor columella cases thereby underlying the importance of intact stapes. However, it is difficult to discern the type of tympanoplasty type III that the patient would undergo prior to the ear surgery.

T1  - Surgical treatment of chronic ear disease in remote or resource-constrained environments
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media performed in low- and middle-income countries creates specific challenges. This paper describes the equipment and a variety of techniques that we find best suited to these conditions. These have been used over many years in remote areas of Nepal.Results and conclusionExtensive chronic suppurative otitis media is frequently encountered, with limited pre-operative investigation or treatment possible. Techniques learnt in better-resourced settings with good follow up need to be modified. The paper describes surgical methods suitable for resource-poor conditions, with rationales. These include methods of tympanoplasty for subtotal wet perforations, hearing reconstruction in wet ears and open cavities, large aural polyps, and canal wall down mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration. Various types of autologous ossiculoplasty are described in detail for use in the absence of prostheses. The following topics are discussed: decision-making for surgery on wet or best hearing ears, children, bilateral surgery, working with local anaesthesia, and obtaining adequate consent in this environment.

T1  - Evaluation of using Bioglass in obliteration of mastoid cavity
AB  - BACKGROUND: A mastoid cavity resulting from a canal wall down mastoidectomy can result in major morbidity for patients due to different open cavity problems. Mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of the bony external ear canal recreates the normal anatomy to avoid such morbidity.METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted for 4 years (between 2008 - 2013) to determine if mastoid obliteration with bioactive glass (Bioglass) following mastoidectomy overcomes the open cavity problems or not. Patients with cholesteatoma had subjected tomastoidectomy with primary or secondary mastoid obliteration, by using bioactive glass (Bioglass),then our primary outcome measure.RESULTS: Forty patients were interviewed. Forty of them were primary or secondary obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomy of a primary cholesteatoma. The most frequent fate of obliteration or reconstruction of mastoid was Grade 1 (47.5%) then Grade 0 (30%). Postoperative hearing assessment showed that the average (mean) air conduction (0.5-4 KHz) was 31.1 dB and the average (mean) bone conduction (0.5-4 KHz) was 15.5 dB. The gain average in air conduction was 26 dB and in bone conduction it was 0.5 dB. Ear discharge was found in 36 patients (90%) preoperative and it was found only in 6 patients (15%) postoperative, in 4 patients (10%) cholesteatoma recidivism or recurrences was present.CONCLUSION: This study shows that the bioactive glass (Bioglass) is one of the beat materials used in mastoidectomy with obliteration of open mastoid cavity.

T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy: A long term commitment to the outpatients?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Canal wall down and canal wall up mastoidectomy represent two surgical approaches to middle ear cleft pathology. Very few studies have examined the effects of these procedures both on the patients' well being and on the resources needed to maintain that state. In this study the authors report the outpatient attendance pattern of canal wall down mastoidectomy patients METHODS : This is a retrospective case-note review of 101 patients who underwent a CWD mastoidectomy at Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, UK. All surgery was performed by the senior author (PCW-T) between 1985 and 1997. The main outcome measures were the frequency of outpatients' visits, clinical problems at visit and the percentage of discharged patients. RESULTS: The studied patients made a total of 1341 outpatient visits between November 1985 and December 1998 with an average of 13.3 visits per patient (median of 11 visits). Almost two thirds of the group still attend for regular follow up. The greatest number of visits occurred in the first 24 months after surgery. The commonest reasons for outpatient visits were the removal of the clinical features of chronic cavity inflammation. Residual/recurrent cholesteatoma, residual perforations and structural cavity problems were infrequent. CONCLUSION: CWD mastoidectomy carries an intrinsic morbidity resulting in a long term attendance in the outpatients.

T1  - Mastoid Obliteration with Synthetic Materials: A Review of the Literature
AB  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy is a surgical technique used for the eradication of middle ear disease. The remaining large mastoid bowl is associated with a number of issues; one of the main techniques that have been developed in order to avoid such problems is the obliteration of the mastoid cavity. The materials used for this reason are either biological or synthetic. The purpose of this survey is to review the published literature related to the therapeutic value of mastoid obliteration with synthetic materials. We searched Web of Science, PubMed, and MEDLINE from 2008 to 2018 using the criteria mastoid obliteration, canal wall down mastoidectomy, chronic otitis media, and cholesteatoma. The search focused on papers concerning the mastoid obliteration with synthetic material, as we focused on looking for outcomes and reported complications. Out of a total of 244 citations, 15 articles were identified, where patients underwent mastoid obliteration with synthetic materials. Most authors used bioactive glass as a filler material. Mastoid obliteration resulted in a decrease in the complications associated with the open mastoid cavity. On the basis of the available limited literature, it seems that mastoid obliteration with synthetic materials is a valuable and safe surgical technique for patients who undergo canal wall down mastoidectomy. The bioactive glass appears to be the most reliable synthetic material.

T1  - Health Related Quality of Life after the Bony Obliteration Tympanoplasty for COM with Cholesteatoma using the COMQ12 - A Disease Specific PROM
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma by using the chronic otitis media questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of the COMQ-12 of 26 patients who completed the COMQ-12 before and after a CWU-BOT with eradication of cholesteatoma followed by obliteration of the mastoid and paratympanic space with bone chips and bone pate and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain.RESULTS: All patients were operated upon in our institute between 2014 and 2017. The median score of the 12 questions was preoperatively and postoperatively calculated, and then compared. A large effect was observed in the total score and the questions about running ear, discharge, and visits to the general practitioner. A medium positive size effect was observed in the questions about hearing in noisy surroundings, discomfort, dizziness, tinnitus, medication use, and the mental aspect of the patient. In the questions about the hearing at home and quality of life and impact on work, we noted a small positive size effect. In 50% of patients, the HRQOL became normal; the remaining 50% improved to a level very close to normal.CONCLUSION: Canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) showed a clear decrease in the severity of the symptoms, life and work impact, and health care after surgery.

T1  - Open Mastoid Cavity Obliteration With a High-Porosity Hydroxyapatite Ceramic Leads to High Rate of Revision Surgery and Insufficient Cavity Obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term results and present experience with a high-porosity hydroxyapatite ceramic for obliterating large open mastoid cavities.STUDY-DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center.PATIENTS: All patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery for chronic middle ear disease or revision surgery with reduction of an open mastoid cavity using a highly porous hydroxyapatite matrix material (HMM) between May 2005 and June 2013 were assessed for eligibility. Twenty three patients (56.9 +/- 18.3 yr) were included.INTERVENTION: Primary middle ear surgery or revision surgery using a HMM.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone average, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate osseoinduction, osseointegration and presence of cholesteatoma, current quality of life assessed by Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory and change in quality of life post-intervention assessed by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory.RESULTS: Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 88.3 months (SD 21.4 mo) after obliteration of the open mastoid cavity with HMM. Compared with visit 1, patients showed a significantly reduced ABG at visit 2 (29.22 dB +/- 2.71 dB versus 12.77 dB +/- 3.46 dB).CT scan was carried out in 21 patients (91%) patients and 17 patients (74%) underwent MRI.Revision surgery was required in a total of 17 cases (74%). In four patients recurrent cholesteatoma was found at follow up.CONCLUSIONS: Poor cavity obliteration, a high rate of revision surgery and difficult differentiation between recurrent cholesteatoma and granulation tissue in CT scan was observed.

T1  - Congenital Cholesteatoma in Adults-Interesting Presentations and Management
AB  - To report a series of adult patients diagnosed with congenital cholesteatoma (CC) with respect to symptoms, different varieties of presentation, surgical findings and approach used, complications and the postoperative results. A retrospective chart review of adult cases of CC who were treated in the period from January 2014-2017 was carried out in a tertiary care center. Levenson's criteria were used for diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed by imaging and intraoperatively. Postoperative results and complications were also analyzed. Six adult cases of CC were studied with a mean follow up of 10 months. Interesting presentations included otitis media with effusion, non-resolving facial nerve palsy, post aural discharge and meningitis. It included 3 cases of petrous apex cholesteatoma, 2 patients with cholesteatoma involving both the middle ear and mastoid and 1 patient with mastoid cholesteatoma. The operative procedures included canal wall up mastoidectomy (1 patient), atticotomy (1 patient), canal wall down mastoidectomy (1 patient), translabyrinthine and transotic excision of mass with blind sac closure (2 patients) and partial labyrinthectomy (1 patient). Complications encountered during surgery were cerebrospinal fluid leak and worsening of hearing in 2 patients and 1 patient respectively. CC can have variety of interesting presentations in adult population and they may or may not have the classical white mass behind the tympanic membrane. Appropriate individualized surgical planning and intervention gives good results.

T1  - Aural Polyp is not Always Due to Chronic Otitis Media (COM): Preoperative Computed Tomographic Scan is Good Pointer for Sinister Lesions
AB  - Twenty five patients of aural polyp who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy were analysed retrospectively. Histopathological examination revealed cholesteatoma in 22 (88%) patients. However, histopathological diagnosis in 3 of these patients was unusual and rare benign tumors of the middle ear cleft-meningioma, neurilemmoma and capillary hemangioma. Review of the preoperative High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) temporal bone revealed an unusual picture in all of the three cases. Features noted were: widening of the jugular foramen (meningioma), destruction of the anterior wall of mesotympanum (neurilemmoma), enhancing soft tissue density lesion (capillary hemangioma). Further, there was only partial loss of pneumatisation of the mastoid air cells in all of the 3 cases. It was observed that though HRCT temporal bone is a commonly advised investigation in patients of chronic otitis media (COM) with aural polyp, meticulous interpretation may reveal unusual features pointing towards sinister diagnosis. Conclusion: Aural polyp with preservation of pneumatisation of mastoid air cells points towards diagnosis other than COM.

T1  - Petrous Bone Cholesteatoma: Radical Excision with an Endeavour for Hearing Preservation
AB  - To describe surgical outcomes following resection of giant petrous bone cholesteatoma. Retrospective cohort study was undertaken at a tertiary care centre on patients who had undergone surgery for petrous bone cholesteatoma (PBC) from August 2014 to September 2017. For patients with serviceable hearing preoperatively, labyrinth preserving techniques, namely, modified transmastoid translabyrinthine approach (massive PBC-1) and supralabyrinthine approach (supralabyrinthine PBC-1) were considered. In the former, bony labyrinth which had been destroyed due to the disease process, membranous labyrinth remained anatomically and functionally intact following meticulous dissection to remove cholesteatoma matrix. In the latter, supralabyrinthine cell tracts were exenterated without disturbing the cochlea and labyrinth with a canal wall down mastoidectomy. For the remaining patients, labyrinth ablative approach was undertaken (translabyrinthine/transotic). Facial nerve function was evaluated using House-Brackman grading system. Hearing was evaluated using pure tone audiometry. 7 patients were identified (massive-2, supralabyrinthine-3, supralabyrinthine apical-1, infralabyrinthine apical 1). None of the patients experienced deterioration of postoperative bone conduction or facial nerve function (preop-grade 5-4, grade 6-3; postop-grade 2-1, grade 3-2, grade 4-4). Facial nerve was decompressed and anatomically intact in 3 cases. In the remaining, facial hypoglossal anastomosis was done in 3 and facial masseteric anastomosis was done in 1 patient. With a median follow-up of 26 months, recurrence in the form of keratin pearl was seen in 1 patient. Modified translabyrinthine approach preserving membranous labyrinth is a promising hearing preservation strategy. Copyright Â© Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2019.

T1  - Relook on Mastoid Cavity Obliteration: A Prospective Study
AB  - Canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy is the operation of choice for unsafe variety of chronic otitis media. But open mastoid cavity poses many problems. The solution of these problems is obliteration of mastoid cavity that is self-cleaning and easily maintained. In our study we aim to establish the effective technique for mastoid cavity obliteration in CWD mastoidectomy and review its efficacy in producing a dry, low maintenance cavity. This was a non-randomized longitudinal prospective study, performed over 21/2 years in the department of ENT in a tertiary care hospital of Kolkata. Patients of chronic otitis media unsafe variety within the age group of 16-60 years were included in our study. Chronic otitis media unsafe variety with intratemporal or intracranial complications, and extensive cholesteatoma or granulation tissue that can't be cleared completely during operation were excluded. There was no statistical significance for hearing improvement between CWD mastoidectomy without obliteration and CWD mastoidectomy with obliteration. There was significant statistical significance for obliteration of cavity, epithelized cavity and dry cavity between CWD mastoidectomy without obliteration and CWD mastoidectomy with obliteration. Persistent discharge and granulation were significantly more in non-obliterated group. The time taken by the ear to become dry is much shorter after mastoid cavity obliteration. Moreover, lifelong aural toilet and dependence on an ENT surgeon is avoided. Inspite of all these, a few pre-conditions must be fulfilled before embarking on this type of surgery.

The indications were the presence of a wide mastoid cavity after canal wall down mastoidectomy, extrusion of the electrode into the external auditory canal with a wide mastoid cavity and erosion of the posterior wall of the ear canal, and the presence of cholesteatoma in a cophotic ear with previous surgery. The ear canal was defunctionalized in all three cases; in two of them with obliteration of the Eustachian tube and in none of the cases the mastoid was obliterated. There was a single complication associated with the procedure corresponding to a small retention cholesteatoma in the skin of the obliterated duct sac, that didn't required surgical intervention.CONCLUSION: Subtotal petrosectomy is a surgical alternative for cochlear implant surgery in patients with chronic ear pathology, wide cavities or cochlear implant extrusion, not associated to significant complications.

T1  - The benefit of trans-attic endoscopic control of ossicular prosthesis after cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To show the efficiency of using transmastoid atticotomy (TMA) endoscopy on the outcome of ossiculoplasty in patients with cholesteatoma. TMA is often performed as part of the surgical management of patients with middle ear cholesteatoma extending to the epitympanum. TMA can also be used as an access for endoscopic view to confirm the right alignment and stability of the ossicular prosthesis because the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane will obscure the visualization of the prosthesis.METHODS: A retrospective study was done at a tertiary referral institute, including 133 ears with cholesteatoma that underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (CWU) with ossicular reconstruction using titanium prosthesis between August 2013 and August 2015. Post packing of the ear canal and position, stability, and axis of the prosthesis were checked using endoscope positioned in the attic through TMA. A postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (ABG) of 20 dB or less was considered as a successful hearing result. Results are compared with historical control groups.RESULTS: Of the 133 ears, 88 patients underwent reconstruction with partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), whereas the rest (45 patients) had total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP). A postoperative ABG <= 20 dB was obtained in 77.4% of all the patients (79.5% for PORP; 73.3% for TORP).CONCLUSION: Endoscopic assessment of the ossicular prosthesis via the attic, after repositioning of the tympanomeatal flap and packing the ear canal, decreases the risk of immediate ossiculoplasty failure and improves the functional outcome after ossicular chain reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:2754-2759, 2019.

T1  - Cost-comparison analysis of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) versus second look surgery for the detection of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesteatoma is a destructive, erosive growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear cleft. Following treatment with a canal wall-up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy, surveillance of residual and recurrent disease has traditionally been achieved through a second look tympanotomy following the initial procedure. Historically, MRI sequences have been inadequate at differentiating between granulation tissue, inflammation, and cholesteatoma. Recent literature has shown diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWMRI) to be a viable alternative to second look surgery for the detection of residual or recurrent disease. The goal of the present study was to perform a cost analysis of DWIMRI versus second look surgery in the detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma following combined approach tympanomastoidectomy.METHODS: A probabilistic decision tree model was generated from a literature review to compare traditional second look surgery with DWMRI. Cost inputs were obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) schedule of benefits. Costs were reported in Canadian dollars and a payer perspective was adopted. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed.RESULTS: According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, mean cost difference of traditional second look tympanotomy versus echo planar imaging (EPI) DWMRI was $180.27CAD, 95%CI [$177.32, $188,32] in favour of second-look tympanotomy. However, mean cost difference of traditional second look tympanotomy versus non-EPI DWMRI was $390.66CAD, 95%CI [$381.52, $399.80] in favour of non-EPI DWMRI.CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-weighted MRI, specifically non-EPI sequences, are a viable cost-saving alternative to second-look tympanotomy in the setting of detecting residual or recurrent cholesteatoma.

T1  - Outcomes of Modified Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy and Mastoid Obliteration Using Autologous Materials
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The traditional canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) procedure commonly has potential problems of altering the anatomy and physiology of the middle ear and mastoid. This study evaluated outcomes in patients who underwent modified canal wall down mastoidectomy (mCWDM) and mastoid obliteration using autologous materials.METHODS: Our study included 76 patients with chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, and adhesive otitis who underwent mCWDM and mastoid obliteration using autologous materials between 2010 and 2015. Postoperative hearing airbone gap and complications were evaluated.RESULTS: During the average follow-up of 64 months (range, 20 to 89 months), there was no recurrent or residual cholesteatoma or chronic otitis media. No patient had a cavity problem and anatomic integrity of the posterior canal wall was obtained. There was a significant improvement in hearing with respect to the postoperative air-bone gap (P<0.05). A retroauricular skin depression was a common complication of this technique.CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that our technique can prevent various complications of the classical CWDM technique using autologous tissues for mastoid cavity obliteration. It is also an appropriate method to obtain adequate volume for safe obliteration.

T1  - Canal wall down versus canal wall up surgeries in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Background/aim: To compare outcomes of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) techniques in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma.Materials and methods: Medical records of 76 patients who had a primary surgery due to middle ear cholesteatoma between July 2015 and November 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Hearing thresholds, speech discrimination scores (SDS), recurrences, and revision surgeries of CWU and CWD surgeries were compared.Results: Of 76 cholesteatoma cases, 40 (52.6%) had a CWU and 36 (47.4%) had a CWD operation. Postoperatively, the mean air conduction thresholds were significantly better in CWU compared to CWD surgeries (P = 0.016). The presence of the stapes and the type of reconstruction material used did not have a significant effect on auditory success rates (P = 0.342 and P = 0.905, respectively). Auditory success was affected by the status of the middle ear mucosa as well. The recurrence and revision rates did not differ between the surgical techniques (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Status of the middle ear mucosa and external auditory canal are important factors affecting the outcomes in cholesteatoma. Instead of a CWD surgery, a CWU surgery seems applicable in cases of cholesteatoma when the bone in the external auditory canal is not eroded by the disease.

T1  - Trans-canal endoscopic ear surgery and canal wall-up tympano-mastoidectomy for pediatric middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical parameters, outcomes and complications of transcanal endoscopic ear surgeries (EES) and canal wall-up tympano-mastoidectomy (CWU) for middle ear cholesteatoma in children and to compare between the two surgical approaches.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children (< 16 years) who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma involving the middle ear only with a minimal follow-up period of 12 months. Demographic features, site and extent of disease, outcome and complications were reviewed and compared between the groups.RESULTS: Thirty EES and 19 CWU were included. The overall disease relapse rates in the EES and CWU groups were 20% (n = 6, residual rate = 10%, recurrence rate = 10%) and 47% (n = 9, residual rate = 11%, recurrence rate = 37%), respectively (p = 0.04), with mean duration of follow-up of 32.6 and 37.2 months, respectively. In the EES and CWU groups, the most common site of residual disease was the mastoid cavity/antrum (n = 2, 66% and n = 2, 100%, respectively). Most recurrences involved the epitympanum and extended into the tympanic cavity (n = 2, 66%) in the EES group and into the tympanic cavity, posterior mesotympanum and mastoid cavity/antrum (n = 3, 43%, each) in the CWU group. The overall complication rates in the EES and CWU groups were 10% (n = 3) and 11% (n = 2), respectively (p = 0.61).CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ear surgeries in children were found to be an acceptable and safe technique for the treatment of cholesteatoma limited to the middle ear cavity. A better overall success rate and a similar complication rate were found in the EES group when compared to CWU.

T1  - Chronic Draining Ear and Cholesteatoma Recidivism: A Retrospection from Clinical, Imaging, and Surgical Perspectives
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the reasons for persistent draining ear and cholesteatoma recidivism following canal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy by studying the sensitivity of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning in different potential etiologies, corroborating through appropriate surgical intervention, and thereby, to suggest proper preventive measures.Methods: In this observational study, 32 chronic, refractory draining ears were subjected to revision surgery following a radical or a modified radical mastoidectomy. Besides disease (cholesteatoma/granulations) eradication, pitfalls of the primary surgeries were addressed. Data were interpreted for studying the epidemiologic profile, the clinical presentation at recurrence, the type of primary surgery, the sites of recidivism, the probable causes, and the best possible management at revision.Results: Of the 32 patients/ears, 23 had residual/recurrent cholesteatoma. Major reasons were inadequate disease clearance, contracted/inadequate conchomeatoplasty, no cavity obliteration, and inappropriate bone work. HRCT predicted persistent bridge and lateral semicircular canal dehiscence with 100%, and ossicular integrity and bony overhang with >80% sensitivity. Sinus tympani and oval window niche were the commonest sites of recurrence. At revision, radical/modified radical mastoidectomies were associated with cavity obliteration and appropriate revision of conchomeatoplasty in 28 patients.Conclusion: Recurrence of cholesteatoma/granulations is an important cause for chronic drainage from post-CWD cavities. Revision surgery explores the surgical pitfalls, and ensures clearance of disease from hidden areas, adequate bone work, and optimum conchomeatoplasty following cavity obliteration to provide a safe, dry ear with hearing improvement whenever feasible.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of size of temporal fascia graft on healing of the mastoid cavity in patients undergoing canal wall down (CWD) procedures.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 32 patients (ages from 10 to 69 years) who were performed CWD tympanomastoidectomy from 2016 to 2018. Patients were divided into 2 different groups randomly based on size of fascia used in the operations. Group 1 consisted of 19 patients with temporal muscle fascia large enough to extend up to antrum by passing through over the facial ridge. Group 2 consisted of 13 patients with fascia of a size hardly enough to create a middle ear space, which were quite smaller than those the first group. It was also observed that whether or not the type of pathology (cholesteatoma, granulation tissue or both) had an effect to the epithelialization time of the cavity.RESULTS: Thirty-two patients met inclusion criteria. Nineteen patients were randomized to study (large fascia) group and 13 patients were to control (small fascia) group. The mean duration for epithelialization of cavities with study group-large grafts was 34.10 days and that was 39.76 days in control group-small grafts. According to type of pathology; in cases with cholesteatoma, with granulation, and cases of coexisting granulation with cholestatoma; the mean epithelialization times were 38.73, 31.33 and 34.42 days, with respectively.CONCLUSION: Placement of larger fascia graft to line the mastoidectomy cavity facilitate rapid epithelialization and healing in patients undergoing CWD tympanomastoidectomy. Further studies with larger groups would be beneficial to confirm this result in the aspect of statistical significance.

T1  - MRI as an Alternative to Second Look Mastoid Surgery
AB  - The main goal of surgery of cholesteatoma is eradication of the disease and revision surgery is indicated when a dry and safe ear has not been achieved. Residual cholesteatoma usually occurs at the sites that are difficult to reach with an operating microscope, such as posterior tympanum and anterior epitympanic recess. Computed tomography can be performed to delineate the extent of disease. High-resolution computed tomography scanning is important for planning for surgery and is indicated for all revision mastoid operations. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography in tissue characterization for diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma. To evaluate the cases of recurrent cholesteatoma comparing the intraoperative surgical findings with the preoperative MRI radiological findings and if the preoperative MRI can replace the second look surgery for cholesteatoma. This study was applied on 60 patients that have a recurrent cholesteatoma after previous mastoid surgery. A preoperative radiological evaluation was done by Magnetic resonance, surgical management was done by canal wall up or canal wall down mastoidectomy to exclude residual disease. Then, radiological, and surgical findings correlation was done. Diffusion-weighted MRI successfully detected 42 cases out of the 45 cases of surgically proved cholesteatoma, it has accuracy 95%, sensitivity 93.33%, specificity 100%, PPV 100% and NPV 83.33%. MRI is better than CT in tissue characterization for diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma, and can replace the unnecessary second look surgery of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Negative Predictive Value of Non-Echo-Planar Diffusion Weighted MR Imaging for the Detection of Residual Cholesteatoma Done at 9 Months After Primary Surgery Is not High Enough to Omit Second Look Surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate non echo-planar diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (non-EP DW MRI) at 9 months after primary surgery to rule out residual cholesteatoma in patients scheduled before second-look-surgical exploration.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.SETTING: Secondary teaching hospital.PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: Patients who were scheduled for second-look-surgery after primary canal wall up repair of cholesteatoma underwent 1.5 T MRI including non-EP DWI and high-resolution coronal T1 and T2-FS SE sequences.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Imaging studies were evaluated for the presence of cholesteatoma by three independent observers. Intraoperative observations were regarded the standard of reference. Ear, nose, throat (ENT) surgeons were blinded for imaging findings. The primary outcome was the negative predictive value (NPV) of MR imaging, secondary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value.RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent both MRI and surgery, among whom 22 had a cholesteatoma. Mean time between primary surgery and MRI was 259 days (standard deviation [SD] 108). NPV of non-EP DW MRI in detecting recurrent cholesteatoma was 53% (95% CI: 32-73%). Sensitivity and specificity were 59% (39-77%) and 91% (62-98%), respectively. The positive predictive value was 93% (69-99%). In five out of nine false-negative cases, recurrent cholesteatoma measured 3 mm or less. Using a 3 mm detection threshold, NPV increased to 79%.CONCLUSION: Non-EP DW MRI cannot replace second look surgery in ruling-out residual cholesteatoma at 9 months after primary surgery. It could be used in a follow-up strategy in low risk patients. Further research is needed which types of residual cholesteatoma are not revealed by MRI.

T1  - Chemically Assisted Dissection With Sodium 2-Mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA) in the Surgical Management of Pediatric Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of the chemically assisted dissection with sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA), in the reduction of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma after mastoidectomy in children with chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media (CCOM).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.POPULATION: One hundred forty mastoidectomies performed in patients under 18 years of age for the treatment of CCOM.INTERVENTIONS: Chemically assisted dissection (CAD) with MESNA compared with surgical dissection without MESNA.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recidivism of cholesteatoma (recurrence and residual disease), variations in the average of bone conduction threshold after treatment, and complications.RESULTS: Recidivism of cholesteatoma was significantly lower when CAD with MESNA was used (p < 0.0001). No difference was found in the mean variation of the average of bone conduction thresholds between the groups, confirming its safety profile regarding auditory function. Meatoplasty stenosis after surgery was more prevalent within CAD with MESNA group (p: 0.049).CONCLUSION: Recurrent and residual cholesteatoma remains a problem, especially in children and despite surgical techniques such as canal wall down mastoidectomy and endoscopic ear surgery. CAD with MESNA can be safe and effective to reduce recurrence rates. Multicenter and prospective studies with larger number of patients are needed to validate these findings. The higher rate of meatoplasty stenosis after CAD with MESNA merits additional clinical research to confirm these findings, as well as in vitro studies evaluating the effect of the drug on the activity of fibroblasts and other growth factors that may be involved.

T1  - Predictive Role of Ki-67 and Proliferative-Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) in Recurrent Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential use of Ki-67 and pronuclear cell antigen (PCNA) as indicators of recurrent cholesteatoma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients who had been diagnosed with cholesteatoma and who had undergone canal wall-down mastoidectomy were included in this study. Subjects were divided into two groups: recurrent and non-recurrent (i.e., cases without recurrence for at least 2 years). Ossicular pathologies were recorded. Histopathologic specimens were stained for Ki-67 and PCNA and the percentages of stained cells were calculated.RESULTS: Neither group demonstrated a significant difference in terms of total Ki-67 per cell, Ki-67-stained cell counts, Ki-67-staining percentages, total PCNA per cell, PCNA-stained cell counts, or PCNA-staining percentages (p>0.05). No significant relationship was noted between the staining percentages for either Ki-67 or PCNA and the incudostapedial involvement (p>0.05); however, a significant relationship was noted between Ki-67 staining and malleus involvement (p<0.05).CONCLUSION: Although the recurrent and non-recurrent cholesteatoma groups showed no significant differences in terms of the percentages of stained cells for either Ki-67 or PCNA, we detected high Ki-67 staining in the malleus involvement group. We concluded that cell-proliferation markers could not be defined as indicators of recurrence of cholesteatoma, but they could be defined as indicators of destructive patterns of this disease.

T1  - Surgical Outcome of Mastoid Cavity Obliteration Using Postauricular Composite Bone with Periosteum Flap
AB  - This study was aimed to evaluate surgical outcome of patients undergoing obliteration of mastoid cavity with postauricular composite osteo-periosteal flap. This interventional study was carried out on 100 patients having unsafe CSOM from Nov. 2012 to Oct. 2014 who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty and obliteration of cavity using composite osteo-periosteal flap. The primary outcome measure was control of suppuration and creation of dry, low-maintenance mastoid cavity, which was assessed using Merchant et al. grading system. At the end of 1 year follow-up, 89% patients had Grade 0 summary score while Grade 3 which was considered as failure of control of infection was not obtained in any patient during the entire follow-up period. Mastoid cavity obliteration using composite osteo-periosteal flap is an effective technique to avoid cavity problems.

T1  - Chloramphenicol and acute esophagitis in the emergency department
AB  - Even with its broad spectrum and low cost, concern over chloramphenicol's adverse effects limited its use in the United States during the 1980s. Reports from United Kingdom and China in the 1990s demonstrated a low incidence of blood dyscrasias with the topical preparation of chloramphenicol, and showed continued good efficacy and low cost. Today, topical chloramphenicol is being used by some groups within otolaryngology and ophthalmology in the United States. As a result, emergency physicians are once again considering chloramphenicol-induced side effects in patients presenting to the emergency department. To date, there have been no published reports associating chest pain, dyspnea with chloramphenicol use, and there has only been one report of fungal esophagitis associated with topical chloramphenicol. We present a 31-year-old woman, 4 months status post tympanoplasty with a modified radical canal wall down mastoidectomy due to a cholesteatoma involving the epitympanum who had a residual tympanic membrane defect. She presented to the emergency department with chest "burning", with no other symptoms shortly after starting treatment with an insufflated combination antibiotic containing chloramphenicol. After ruling out cardiopulmonary or vascular etiology, she was treated successfully with a gastrointestinal cocktail cocktail for presumed esophagitis secondary to newly prescribed chloramphenicol.

T1  - [Clinical treatment of congenital middle ear cholesteatoma in children]
AB  - Objective:To summarize the clinical characteristics and clinical treatment of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) of the middle ear in children, provide early diagnosis methods and explore standardized diagnosis and treatment plan.Method:A retrospective chart review of 94 patients with a diagnosis of middle ear cholesteatoma, in Beijing Children's Hospital, between 2009 and 2015 was carried on. 14 patients with CC were identified using the criteria proposed by Levenson, and were divided into two groups according to the course of disease. The course of disease in group A was less than 3 months, and group B was more than 3 months. The main complains, diagnostic methods and Potsic's stage of temporal bone CT findings were recorded.Result:1The age of 14 cases of congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear ranged from 3.33 to 10.17 years, with the median age of 7.20 years. 2Hearing loss (13/14, 92.86%) was the most common complain. Finding methods included hearing screening and CT scan (11/14, 78.57%), tympanotomy (2/14, 14.28%) and otoscopic examination (1/14, 7.14%). 3There were 6 people in group A and 8 in group B. According to Potsic's grading standard, the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (P=0.043). 4The preoperative Air-Bone conduction threshold Gap (ABG) in A and B two groups were (38.10+/-7.43) dB and (42.09+/-9.96) dB, respectively, and there was no significant difference in analysis (P=0.427). 5The difference between pre-ABG and post-ABG [(36.26+/-5.56)dB and (21.70+/-3.80)dB, P=0.004] was significant. Canal wall up mastoidectomy was the preferred procedure and 11/14 (78.57%) patients had this surgery done.Conclusion:The shorter the course of disease, the lower the stage of cholesteatoma of the middle ear indicates the importance of early detection. But congenital cholesteatoma is more occult, and even within 3 months, cholesteatoma can cause severe damage to the hearing and middle ear structure. Early screening programs can recommend hearing screening and CT scan to facilitate early intervention.

T1  - Surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome: a multicenter experience
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: As in other syndromes characterized by craniofacial anomalies, middle ear cholesteatoma is known to have a high prevalence in Turner syndrome. The aim of this study was to review a multicenter experience with the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed sixteen girls with Turner syndrome who underwent otologic surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma between January 2000 and December 2012. Surgery was performed in 3 tertiary care otologic centers. Four patients had bilateral disease, resulting in a total of 20 ears treated. The following data were recorded: age, history of ventilation tube insertion, status of the controlateral ear, cholesteatoma location and extension, and surgical technique involved. Cholesteatoma recidivism, stable mastoid cavity and hearing levels were the main outcomes measured.RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 3 to 15 years (mean 7 years). Fourteen ears underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy: no cases of recurrent cholesteatoma were observed in these cases; revision mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration was needed in 2 ears (14.3%) for recurrent otorrhea. In the remaining 6 ears a staged canal wall up mastoidectomy was performed: 1 child showed a recurrent cholesteatoma and required conversion to canal wall down mastoidectomy. A postoperative air-bone gap result of 0 to 20 dB was achieved in 6 ears (30%); in 9 ears (45%) postoperative air-bone gap was between 21 and 30 dB, while in 5 (25%) was >30 dB. Bone conduction thresholds remained unaffected in all cases.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome is a challenging entity for the otologic surgeon. Although not mandatory, canal wall down mastoidectomy should be regarded as the technique of choice to achieve a safe and dry ear in TS children with middle ear cholesteatoma. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy should be adopted only in appropriately selected patients such as those with limited attic cholesteatoma that can be regularly followed-up.

T1  - Prognostic Factors of Pediatric Revision Ossicular Chain Reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) is a surgical method used to repair conductive hearing loss. In children, up to 40% of OCRs will require revisions. In this study, our aims were to validate improvement in hearing outcomes following revision OCR and identify prognostic factors for successful revision OCRs.DESIGN: Retrospective review at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 2003 to 2014.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Pediatric patients undergoing multiple OCRs who had demographic, operative, and pre- and postoperative audiogram data. Patients included in our study had >= 2 OCR procedures to the same ear. Forty-three of 123 patients met inclusion criteria.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative audiograms were used to compare the changes in pure-tone averages (PTA), speech recognition thresholds, and air-bone gaps following OCR surgeries.RESULTS: Revision OCRs significantly improved PTA, speech recognition thresholds, and air-bone gaps (p values= 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, respectively) and seven patients (14%) had return of normal hearing (PTA < 25 dB). Cholesteatoma at the time of first revision was associated with additional OCR revisions (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.3; p=0.013), while patients who had canal wall down or no mastoidectomy during first OCR revision were less likely to require additional revision compared with patients who had canal wall up mastoidectomy (HR: 0.170, p = 0.041 versus canal wall down; HR: 0.242, p = 0.041 versus no mastoidectomy).CONCLUSIONS: Revision OCR(s) are an acceptable method to improve residual conductive hearing loss following primary OCR surgery in pediatric patients. Patients with cholesteatoma and canal wall up at the time of revision OCR have increased chances of requiring further revision.

T1  - The Bony Obliteration Tympanoplasty in Pediatric Cholesteatoma: Long-term Hearing Results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the hearing results of a 5-year longitudinal study in a pediatric population undergoing surgery for extensive cholesteatoma using a canal wall up (CWU) approach with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space, with a standard residual rate of 5.8%, a recurrence rate of 2.9%, and all ears waterproof, free of otorrhea and all external ear canals patent and self-cleaning.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive study.PATIENTS: Thirty-three children (<=18 yr) undergoing surgery for cholesteatoma (34 ears) between 1997 and 2009.INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing and gain in hearing at 1- and 5-year postsurgery: (1) pure-tone average (PTA), (2) pure-tone average high frequency, (3) pure-tone average including 3 kHz, (4) bone conduction at corresponding frequency averages, (5) gain at corresponding air conduction and bone conduction (gain at corresponding air conduction) frequency averages. (6) The Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plots were used to study the individual cases.RESULTS: The Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plots at 5-year showed in 58.8% of patients a positive gain air conduction. In 23.5% a successful functional result was achieved, defined as an air-bone gap closure to 20 dBHL or less. In 6 patients (17.6%) a limited bone conduction deterioration was shown all limited to maximum 20 dBHL.CONCLUSION: The CWU bony obliteration tympanoplasty in a consecutive series of pediatric extensive cholesteatoma shows a similar to slightly improved hearing outcome as compared with CWU surgery without BOT. Although the series shows a clearly reduced reoperation rate and a significantly improved safety and hygienic outcome as compared with CWU without BOT, better hearing outcomes remain desirable in this group of children.

T1  - Canal reconstruction mastoidectomy: Outcomes comparison following primary versus secondary surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Compare surgical and audiometric outcomes following canal wall reconstruction (CWR) tympanomastoidectomy used as a primary versus secondary approach for treating cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.METHODS: Patients treated for primary/secondary cholesteatoma from 2006 to 2017 via CWR were included if they had preoperative/postoperative audiograms, detailed operative note(s), and >12 months' follow-up. Patients were stratified by previous surgical history into two groups: primary CWR group (PG) and secondary CWR group (SG). Surgical outcomes measured were prevalence of recidivistic cholesteatoma, canal cholesteatoma, revision rate, and canal wall down (CWD) conversion rates. Secondary outcomes were prevalence of infection, external canal adhesions/stenoses, and retractions. Audiometric outcomes included change in pure-tone average and air-bone gap.RESULTS: We stratified 45 patients/ears into the PG and 26 into the SG. The groups did not significantly differ in age, sex, or smoking status. Overall, median follow-up was 35 months. SG patients had higher rates of cholesteatoma detected at staged surgery than did PG patients (P = .04). However, these patients exhibited lower rates of open revision surgery (4% vs.13%) and a significant improvement in air-bone gap (P = .004). Three PG patients (7%) required conversion to CWD versus zero SG patients. Secondary outcomes were similar. Patients who underwent delayed staging >12 months from CWR had increased rates of recidivism and canal adhesion/stenosis.CONCLUSIONS: CWR was effective for treating cholesteatoma as both a primary and secondary surgical approach. SG patients experienced higher rates of recidivism and secondary canal cholesteatoma. PG patients had higher rates of revision surgery. Staging of ears undergoing CWR is important regardless of prior surgical history.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:2580-2587, 2019.

T1  - Anatomical and frequencies-specific hearing results of retrograde mastoidectomy
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and frequency-specific hearing results of canal wall down (CWD) and canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy by retrograde mastoidectomy (RM) surgical method.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent CWU and CWD procedures with method of RM, 53 and 59 patients between January 2010 and June 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. The pre- and post-operative pure tone average air-bone gap (ABG) values of these patients were recorded in detail at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz. Pre and post-operative ABG were evaluated in detail in each group in each frequency. In addition, at least two years follow-up recurrence rates were evaluated.RESULTS: In the CWU method, post-operative ABG decreased significantly at low-frequencies compared to pre-operative ABG (p<0.05), especially at 2kHz (p<0.001). But, auditory improvement was not achieved at 4kHz. In the CWD procedure, auditory improvement was not achieved both 1kHz and 4kHz. CWU and CWD recurrence rates were respectively 9.4% and 10.1%.CONCLUSION: Postoperative hearing results of both surgical methods provide good auditory outcome at low-frequencies. This improvement is evident in CWU especially at 2kHz. This may be related to the protection of the external ear canal. In both surgical methods of RM, a satisfactory anatomical success was achieved with recurrence rates of around 10%. RM is a good surgical technique alternative to classical canal wall down procedure with both auditory results and low recurrence rates. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Outcomes Following Modified Tympanomastoidectomy With Soft-wall Reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes following modified tympanomastoidectomy with soft-wall reconstruction (MTMSWR).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Forty-seven patients (48 ears) with aggressive cholesteatoma undergoing MTMSWR.INTERVENTIONS: Canal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy with temporalis fascia reconstruction of the posterior external auditory canal (EAC).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cholesteatoma recidivism; hearing outcomes; degree of soft-wall retraction; time to epithelialization; otorrhea.RESULTS: All ears had some form of ossicular compromise. There were 41 ears with completed surveillance of which 39% demonstrated recidivism for cholesteatoma. Of these, 68.8% had a small cholesteatoma foci averaging 3.7 mm. Air pure-tone average remained stable or improved for 60.0% and declined <= 20 dB for 85.7%. Excluding ears unable to undergo ossicular chain reconstruction, final air-bone gap was <= 30 dB for 66.7%. Retraction of the reconstructed wall was absent-to-mild in 34.7% and moderate-to-full in 52.1%. Thirteen percent had soft-wall breakdown. Average time to full epithelialization of the wall was 58.5 days.CONCLUSIONS: MTMSWR is an option for restoring the posterior EAC wall following CWD surgery. Recidivism is comparable to canal wall up surgery, and hearing outcomes are generally better than CWD. Other advantages include rapid epithelialization, low rates of otorrhea, and restoration of a self-cleaning EAC regardless of retraction into the mastoid cavity.

T1  - Using Non-Echoplanar Diffusion Weighted MRI in Detecting Cholesteatoma Following Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy - Our Experience with 20 Patient Episodes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To our knowledge, there is no study exploring specifically the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in patients with previous canal wall down (CWD) surgery when combined with appropriate clinical evaluation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the performance of DWI in the detection of residual or recurrent disease in patients who have had a previous CWD mastoidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 13 patients with a CWD mastoidectomy subsequently having at least one further DWI prior to further mastoid exploration that generated a total of 20 patient episodes. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on a 1.5 T superconductive unit using a standard head matrix coil. Coronal 2 mm thick TSE T2-weighted images (TR: 4640 ms; TE: 103 ms; matrix: 245,384; field of view: 150x200 mm) were performed. Operative findings were reviewed for all 20 patient episodes to compare DWI findings with intraoperative findings. Based on this, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated.RESULTS: DWI had a sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 60%, PPV of 87%, NPV of 75%, and accuracy of 80%.CONCLUSION: Given the high sensitivity of DWI in the detection of residual or recurrent disease, the present study supports DWI as a useful tool in the detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in cases following CWD surgery, where clinical acumen suggests an ongoing disease process despite no overt cholesteatoma being visible.

T1  - The Impact of the Transcanal Endoscopic Approach and Mastoid Preservation on Recurrence of Primary Acquired Attic Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the factors associated with recurrent disease following surgery for primary acquired attic cholesteatoma. We hypothesize that minimal invasive, mucosal sparing operation techniques have beneficial effects on the outcome in terms of recurrence.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 110 patients presenting with primary acquired attic cholesteatoma were enrolled in the study. Patients undergoing revision surgery or a canal wall down procedure, as well as patients with residual disease were excluded from the study.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: During follow-up recurrence was assessed and classified into normal, self-cleaning retraction pockets, or recurrent cholesteatoma requiring revision surgery.RESULTS: We observed during follow-up statistically significant decrease (p = 0.036) in the occurrence of retraction pockets and recurrence in patients operated by the transcanal endoscopic approach (n = 55, 11% re-retraction, 9% recurrence) compared with those who underwent a canal wall up procedure (n = 55, 16% re-retraction, 22% recurrence). However, the multivariate model did not demonstrate statistically significant predictors regarding the outcome. Moreover, the preservation or direct reconstruction of the ossicular chain had a beneficial effect on the outcome. We observed 11% re-retraction and 9% recurrence in cases with preserved or reconstructed ossicular chain versus 18% re-retraction and 24% recurrence (p = 0.011) in cases of nonpreserved or non-reconstructed ossicular chain. A score was established according to the intraoperative mucosal damage and correlated to the occurrence of recurrence (p = 0.02). The risk of recurrence increased by 23.6% (95% confidence interval: 3.22-48.1) with each additional mucosal damage site.CONCLUSION: Transcanal endoscopic approaches that preserve the mastoid may play an important role in preventing recurrence and underscores the importance of the mucosa and mastoid air cells on middle ear homeostasis.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy for Cholesteatoma in Children: Audiometric Results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the audiometric outcomes of tympanomastoidectomy in children with cholesteatoma and to evaluate factors that may affect outcomes.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. All pediatric patients diagnosed with cholesteatoma who underwent primary canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy with or without ossicular reconstruction from 2009 to 2016 at a tertiary university-affiliated pediatric medical center were included. Pure tone average (PTA) and air-bone gap (ABG) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were compared before and after surgery.RESULTS: The cohort included 100 children (104 tympanomastoidectomies) of mean age 10.35 +/- 3.6 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 35.4 +/- 24.1 months. At surgery, 22 patients (21.2%) had intact ossicular chains, and 82 (78.8%) had ossicular discontinuity. Fifty-three patients (51%) underwent ossicular reconstruction, either partial (34 patients [64.1%]) or total (19 patients [35.8%]). In comparison with preoperative audiometry, there was a statistically significant improvement in PTA-ABG at the first postoperative examination (27.5 +/- 12.7 vs 21.1 +/- 11.1 dB, P = .001) and at the end of follow-up (20.2 +/- 12.7 dB, P = .003) . Overall, values of less than 20 dB were measured in 34% of patients preoperatively and 73% postoperatively. On subgroup analysis, in patients who underwent any ossicular reconstruction, PTA-ABG was significantly improved relative to the preoperative value (28.1 +/- 14.7 dB) at both the first (19.1 +/- 11.9 dB, P = .006) and last (22.4 +/- 15.1 dB, P = .011) audiometry examinations.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing outcomes after pediatric cholesteatoma surgery are diverse and related to several factors. The authors found that ossicular reconstruction improves audiometric outcomes, and the changes remain stable over time.Level of evidence: iib.

T1  - Single-Stage Mastoid Obliteration in Cholesteatoma Surgery and Recurrent and Residual Disease Rates: A Systematic Review
AB  - Importance: The ideal surgical treatment of cholesteatoma has been subject to discussion for years because both traditional surgical techniques (canal wall down [CWD] and canal wall up [CWU] tympanoplasty) have their own advantages and disadvantages. A more recently propagated surgical approach, to combine the CWD or CWU tympanoplasty technique with obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanum, is showing promising results.Objective: To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates after single-stage CWU and CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration.Evidence Review: A systematic search of literature was performed to identify relevant publications in multiple electronic databases. The initial search was conducted in December 2016 and was updated in July 2017. Each study was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers on predetermined eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was determined using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale, and the relevance to the current topic was determined using a 4-criterion checklist.Findings: The searches identified a total of 336 potentially relevant publications; 190 articles were excluded based on title and abstract. The full-text articles of the remaining 146 citations were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 22 articles. After assessing these remaining articles for methodological quality and relevance to the current topic, another 8 studies were excluded, and a total of 13 studies (1534 patients) were included. Of the 1534 patients who underwent CWD or CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, the rate of recurrent disease was 4.6%, and the rate of residual disease was 5.4%. In CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, these rates were 0.28% and 4.2%, respectively and in CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, 5.9% and 5.8%, respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: We show the recurrent and residual disease rates after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration to be qualitatively similar to, if not better than, previously reported rates of for nonobliterative techniques. In this study, the lowest recurrent and residual rates were reported when combining the CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, on average 0.28 and 4.2%, respectively.

T1  - Long-term status of middle-ear aeration post canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retraction pocket theory is the most acceptable theory for cholesteatoma formation. Canal wall down mastoidectomy is widely performed for cholesteatoma removal. Post-operatively, each patient with canal wall down mastoidectomy has an exteriorised mastoid cavity, exteriorised attic, neo-tympanic membrane and shallow neo-middle ear.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to clinically assess the status of the neo-tympanic membrane and the exteriorised attic following canal wall down mastoidectomy.METHODS: All post canal wall down mastoidectomy patients were recruited and otoendoscopy was performed to assess the neo-tympanic membrane. A clinical classification of the overall status of middle-ear aeration following canal wall down mastoidectomy was formulated.RESULTS: Twenty-five ears were included in the study. Ninety-two per cent of cases showed some degree of neo-tympanic membrane retraction, ranging from mild to very severe.CONCLUSION: After more than six months following canal wall down mastoidectomy, the degree of retracted neo-tympanic membranes and exteriorised attics was significant. Eustachian tube dysfunction leading to negative middle-ear aeration was present even after the canal wall down procedure. However, there was no development of cholesteatoma, despite persistent retraction.

T1  - Canal wall up surgery with mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to evaluate surgical outcome and residual and recurrence rates of canal wall up (CWU) surgery with obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanum.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral center.METHODS: Patients with (sequelae of) acquired cholesteatoma treated with primary or revision CWU surgery with obliteration of the epitympanum and mastoid were identified retrospectively from 2010 to 2014. Obliteration was performed with cartilage chips or a periosteal midtemporal flap in combination with bone pate and/or hydroxyapatite. Patients were followed up with micro-otoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).RESULTS: Ninety-nine ears in 96 patients were managed with obliteration of the epitympanum and mastoid following CWU surgery. Mean postoperative follow-up was 39.6 (standard deviation [SD] = 16.3). Mean follow-up until the last MRI-DWI was 29.7 months (SD = 16.0). In total, 74 ears in 72 adult patients (mean age = 46.8 years) were operated and 25 ears in 24 pediatric patients (mean age = 12.8 years). The overall recurrence rate was 7.1%, and the residual rate was 7.1%. In comparison, before the introduction of obliteration, the residual rate in our clinic was 24.4% and the recurrence rate 39.7%. After CWU surgery with obliteration, recurrence in pediatric patients (16.0%) was more frequent than in adults (4.1%). Although this difference was not statistically significant, a trend was observed (P = .066).CONCLUSIONS: Obliteration of the epitympanum and mastoid is a reliable and safe technique following CWU surgery for cholesteatoma, resulting in low residual and recurrence rates.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:981-985, 2019.

T1  - [Management of 242 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma by otoendoscopic surgery and the postoperative effect analysis]
AB  - Objective: To summarize and discuss the characteristics of endoscopic approach to manage the middle ear cholesteatoma, and to evaluate the operative safety and outcomes based on the data from the multicenter study. Methods: The data of 242 cases diagnosed with the middle ear cholesteatoma and received operation through endoscopic approach between June 2016 and June 2017 in six tertiary hospitals in China were analyzed in this work. There were 130 males and 112 females, with the age ranging from 3 to 72 years old. We evaluated the strategy about how to manage the cholesteatoma, discussed the detailed techniques about how to remove the cholesteatoma and to improve the efficiency under endoscopic visualization. Meanwhile, the recurrence rate and residual rate of cholesteatoma as well as the complications in endoscopic approach were summarized. Results: A total of 158 cases were operated in exclusively endoscopic transcanal approach, 72 cases operated in combined approach, and 12 cases operated majorly under microscope and minorly under endoscope. 219 cases were operated in one stage surgery, 23 cases received second look. In the second look, 3 cases were detected with residual cholesteatomas. Among them, 2 cases were found by MRI-DWI examination after the first-stage operation. With endoscopic examination after operation, 17 cases showed retracted pocket recurrence (7%,17/242). With introduction of endoscope in cholesteatoma, 153 cases were achieved canal wall-up operation (63%, 153/242). The complications in endoscopic approach included chord tympani never injury in 27 cases, skin injury of ear canal in 11 cases, tinnitus in 13 cases, vertigo in 7 cases, external ear canal stenosis in 1 case. Conclusions: Using otoendoscope in cholesteatoma surgery would help keeping the normal structures of middle ear as much as possible, benefit to remove the hiding pathologies, help reducing residual cholesteatoma and lowering the rate of canal wall-down operation as well. This study showed good safety of otoendoscopic cholesteatoma surgery, however, strict evaluation of indication and quite good surgical techniques and skills are necessary for avoiding unexpected complication.

T1  - Treatment of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain: anatomic and functional results
AB  - SUMMARY: In case of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain, the primary aims of surgery are complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and reconstruction of a dry and safe middle ear; if possible, ossicular chain continuity and therefore the preoperative hearing must be preserved. The aim of this retrospective study is to present the experience of the U.O.C. Otorinolaringoiatria Universitaria of University of Bari "Aldo Moro" in treatment of intact ossicular chain cholesteatoma with Bondy modified radical mastoidectomy (BMRM) and canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT). The study group was composed of 65 subjects affected by cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain. Mean age was 40.7 years (range 6-79), with 42 males and 23 females. 30 patients were treated by a BMRM and 35 by CWUT, in 22 cases without mastoidectomy and in 13 cases with mastoidectomy. Mean follow-up was 24.25 months. In the BMRM group, no cases of residual cholesteatoma located in the middle ear space were detected; at follow-up, 1 patient developed a retraction pocket (3.33%), 1 patient showed a small epidermal cysts of the tympanic membrane (3.33%) and 3 patients (10%) experienced otorrhoea. In CWUT, residual cholesteatoma was detected in 2 cases (5.7%); at follow-up, 3 patients presented recurrent cholesteatoma (8.57%; 2, 6 and 8 years after surgery), 3 cases a retraction pocket (8.57%) and one case otorrhoea (2.86%). Statistical analysis showed a significant higher number of residual cholesteatoma in CWUT (p 0.005) and differences in terms of long-term complications. No significant changes in hearing occurred post-operatively or at 1 year follow-up in either group. The current trend in our centre is to perform BMRM when indicated and CWUT preferably without mastoidectomy in case of mesotympanic cholesteatoma with normal OC.

T1  - Piezosurgery-, neuroendoscopy-, and neuronavigation-assisted intracranial approach for removal of a recurrent petrous apex cholesteatoma: technical note
AB  - Current approaches for resection of petrous bone cholesteatomas (PBCs), such as canal wall up (closed) and canal wall down (open) mastoidectomies, in the pediatric population present recurrence rates ranging between 17% and 70% with a high rate of postoperative complications involving hearing loss and facial nerve weakness. This technical note illustrates an alternative intracranial approach that was used in combination with the techniques of piezoelectric surgery, neuroendoscopy, and neuronavigation for safe and effective removal in a difficult pediatric case of recurrent PBC. The third recurrence of a PBC in a 14-year-old girl was diagnosed by CT and MRI. A retrosigmoid approach gave access to the petrous apex, allowing for the safe and complete removal of the lesion and decompression of the facial nerve and internal carotid artery. The intraoperative implementation of piezoelectric surgery, neuronavigation, neuroendoscopy, and neuromonitoring ensured better intraoperative visualization, safer bone removal, and preservation of nerve function, facilitating a macroscopically total resection of the pathology without additional neurological damage of the adjacent tissues. Cholesteatoma extension could be clearly verified by intraoperative neuronavigation. Neuroendoscopy and piezoelectric surgery provided good support in the safe bone removal in close vicinity to neurovascular structures and in full vision inside the cholesteatoma cavity beyond the line of sight of the microscope. Hearing and facial nerve function could be preserved. The presented intracranial retrosigmoid approach combined with multiple intraoperative assisting techniques proved to be effective for the safe and complete removal of recurrent PBC, providing excellent intraoperative visualization and the possibility of preserving cranial nerve function.

T1  - Facial canal dehiscence rate: a retrospective analysis of 372 chronic otitis media cases
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the rate and location of facial canal dehiscence (FCD) observed during surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) with or without cholesteatoma.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Operative details of 1296 patients who underwent chronic otitis media surgery from January 2000 to January 2017 by the same surgeon were included in this retrospective study focusing on intraoperative observations of FCD.RESULTS: Because of the type of the surgery, the Fallopian canal could not be seen completely, so 924 of the cases which only involved performing a tympanoplasty were not included in the study. A total of 372 patients (196 males and 176 females) who had a canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy were included in the study. A CWD mastoidectomy was performed on 250 patients, while 122 patients underwent a CWU mastoidectomy. The prevalence of FCD was 11.29% (42/372 patients). The dehiscence was more common in patients with cholesteatoma (n = 37; 88.1%) than those with non-cholesteatoma (n = 5; 11.9%). The tympanic segment (n = 32; 76.19%) was the most common location for FCD. When we compared the ossicular erosion results of the cases that had FCD, erosion in three ossicles together was more statistically significantly frequent than the other possibilities.CONCLUSION: It is possible to see FCD because of COM, especially with cholesteatoma. FCD is most commonly seen around the oval window. If stapes or all three ossicles are eroded, the surgeons must be more careful regarding FCD to be more effective in preventing facial nerve damage.

T1  - [Cause analysis of non dry ear after canal wall down mastoidectomy]
AB  - Objective:To investigate the possible causes of non dry ear after canal wall down mastoidectomy(CWD).Method:Clinical data of 42 patients undergoing revision CWD in our hospital were analyzed retrospectively,which included history,symptoms,signs,audiological examination,imaging examination, intraoperative findings and postoperative follow-up.All patients underwent CWD and tympanoplasty under general anesthesia.Result:Twenty-six cases were insufficient opened of sinodural angle,36 cases remained mastoid air cell(9 cases is mastoid tip air cell remained),13 cases were inadequate exposured of anterior epitympanic recess, 23 cases were inadequate exposured of posterior tympanum, 25 cases had high facial ridge, posterior facial nerve and labyrinth air cell were 5 cases,3 cases had granulation in round window, 5 cases had dysfunctional eustachian tube, 32 cases had narrow external acoustic meatus. During 3 months,6 months and 1 year follow-up, all 42 cases patients under revision CWD presented with dry ears.Conclusion:Insufficient opened of sinodural angle and mastoid air cell,inadequate exposured of anterior epitympanic recess and posterior tympanum, high facial ridge, narrow external acoustic meatus are all the possible causes of no-dry ear after CWD; As the location of concealment, posterior facial nerve and labyrinth air cell are difficult to clean. The dressing cavity do not be cleaned in time after operation is also the underlying cause of postoperative non-dry ear.

T1  - Chronic otitis media: surgical failures and management
AB  - Failure of primary tympanomastoid surgery to control chronic otitis is a difficult otologic problem. The facial nerve, middle fossa dura, and inner ear structures are at high risk because of distorted anatomy from the primary surgery and/or recurrent disease. In this article our techniques and experience with 42 revision procedures for recurrent chronic otitis with and without cholesteatoma are presented. Control of otorrhea and/or cholesteatoma was achieved in 93% of the cases; however, this might be less after 5 years of follow-up. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 25 dB, and this is a 6 dB improvement from the preoperative level. Revision tympanomastoid surgery was very effective and safe in the management of this difficult problem. For cholesteatoma in particular, the canal wall down technique is our procedure of choice.

T1  - Inside-out technique cholesteatoma surgery: a retrospective long-term analysis of 604 operated ears between 1992 and 2006
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively present the experience with 586 patients or 604 ears operated for cholesteatoma.PATIENTS: All patients, adults and children, with histologically confirmed cholesteatoma and a mean age of 36 years (3 to 86 yr).INTERVENTION: With the inside-out technique, cholesteatoma is eradicated from the epitympanum toward the mastoid: small cholesteatoma is removed by a transcanal approach, and medium-sized cholesteatoma is removed by a retroauricular atticotomy and cartilaginous reconstruction of the canal wall. An extended cholesteatoma is eradicated by a classical canal wall down radical cavity. A simultaneous reconstruction of the middle ear by tympano-ossiculoplasty is performed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative anatomic results with regard to recurrence, intactness of the tympanic membrane, and condition of the ear site. Auditory performance including air-bone gap, auditory threshold and improvement of hearing.RESULTS: A complete removal of cholesteatoma in 93% of adults and 87% of children (mean postoperative follow-up, 10 yr; range, 2-15 yr) was achieved, with 95% dry ears and a mean air-bone gap of less than 30 dB in 78% postoperatively. Nine percent of all patients were lost to follow-up.CONCLUSION: The inside-out technique allows the safe removal of cholesteatoma according to the extent of disease combining the advantages of the canal wall down technique with respect to radicality of cholesteatoma removal and of the canal wall up technique with respect to functional results, with the added advantage of single-stage reconstruction.

T1  - Mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal wall up mastoidectomy for prevention of retraction pocket
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical outcome in patients who have undergone mastoid and epitympanic obliteration technique.STUDY DESIGN: : Retrospective review.SETTING: Tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: The study group included 151 patients with cholesteatoma who underwent mastoid and epitympanic obliteration technique. This technique was applied to cases who had a strong chance of recurrent retraction pocket and cholesteatoma formation, including those patients with an adhesive drum indicating poor eustachian tube function (n = 52) and patients with a destructive scutum (n = 68). Thirty-one patients had both an adhesive drum and a destructive scutum.INTERVENTION: The connection between the mastoid cavity and the middle ear was blocked by obliterating the epitympanum and antrum with bone pate and the remaining mastoid cavity with abdominal fat.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The postoperative drum state, the incidence of retraction pocket formation and cholesteatoma recurrence, the surgical complications of obliteration, and the hearing outcome.RESULTS: In 114 of 151 patients (75.4%), the middle ear was well healed and well aerated. The retraction pocket formation or cholesteatoma recurrence did not develop in any subject. Postauricular skin depression was the most common complication of this technique (n = 31 [20.5%]). In three patients (2.0%), the bone pate used for obliteration was infected. Of the 56 cases who underwent a staged operation to regain their hearing, 37 resulted in a postoperative air-bone gap less than 20 dB hearing level.CONCLUSION: Mastoid and epitympanic obliteration is an effective option for preventing a retraction pocket and cholesteatoma recurrence in patients with a poorly functioning eustachian tube or a defective scutum, while preserving the same advantage of the canal wall up technique.

T1  - Surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with Down syndrome
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report our personal experience in the surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children with Down syndrome.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary care otology and skull base centers.PATIENTS: Nine patients with Down syndrome were surgically treated for cholesteatoma. Two patients had bilateral disease, resulting in a total of 11 ears surgically treated.INTERVENTION: A canal-wall-up mastoidectomy was performed in two ears; in eight of the ears, a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy was carried out and a modified Bondy procedure was performed in one ear.RESULTS: Residual cholesteatoma was found in one ear after the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy and recurrent cholesteatoma developed in another ear, also after canal-wall-up mastoidectomy. The recurrence required conversion to canal-wall-down mastoidectomy. One patient developed a perforation of the neotympanic membrane that had to be revised.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma in children with Down syndrome is a challenging entity for the otologic surgeon. Otolaryngologists should always suspect a cholesteatoma in each child with Down syndrome presenting warning symptoms such as otorrhea and hearing loss. If there is any doubt on inspection, further imaging studies (high-resolution computed tomography) are necessary. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first report to document the surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in subjects with Down syndrome.

T1  - Long-term outcome of atticotomy for cholesteatoma in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of atticotomy (AT) surgery for cholesteatoma in children.STUDY DESIGN: Case series, retrospective chart review.SETTING: General otology practice in a teaching hospital.PATIENTS: Fifty-three children aged 5 to 16 years old with cholesteatoma limited to the attic and middle ear who underwent AT between the years 1979 to 1994.INTERVENTIONS: AT consisting of removal of cholesteatoma confined mainly to the attic. The procedure consists of removal of the lateral attic wall (scutum) and involved ossicles with excision of the cholesteatoma and tympanic membrane grafting with temporalis fascia, leaving a small attical cavity. The mastoid antrum was left intact.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease recurrence, middle ear status, hearing results, and the need for further surgery.RESULTS: Mean follow up was 5.1 (+/-3.6) years. Eleven (21%) children required completion canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy because of residual disease or recurrence. The mean preoperative speech recognition threshold was 39.4 +/- 13.4 dB. The mean postoperative speech recognition threshold was 34.5 +/- 15.4, an improvement of 6.1 dB compared with the preoperative level. Last follow-up examination revealed a dry ear in all cases but one.CONCLUSIONS: In selected cases, AT can be a less invasive option in children with cholesteatoma limited to the attic and middle ear.

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma: canal wall window alternative to canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A previous pilot series described a hybrid mastoidectomy technique, canal wall window (CWW), which substituted for the canal wall down (CWD) procedure and involved slitting the posterior canal wall. The current, larger series compares the results of the CWW procedure with conventional surgical techniques.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 78 pediatric ears.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: The mean patient age was 13.5 years.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The data analyzed included ears later requiring conversion from CWW to CWD, dry/moist ear results, recidivation determined by two separate methods, and audiometric data statistically analyzed using independent-samples analysis (unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test).RESULTS: First, of 42 CWW ear procedures, 6 (14%) later required conversion to CWD. Second, dry ear results were as follows: for CWW, 94%; for CWD, 92%; and for CWU (canal wall up), 90%. Third, recidivation determined at 1 year (standard rate) was, for CWW, 19.5%; for CWD, 0%; and for CWU, 7.7%; the at-risk calculation rate was, for CWW, 27%; for CWD, 0%; and for CWU, 8.3%. The 6-year recidivation rate for all three surgical techniques was 0%. 4). The mean preoperative-to-postoperative four-tone air-bone gap change was, for CWW, from 29.7 to 26.4 dB; for CWD, from 32.9 to 39.0 dB; and for CWU, from 21.0 to 25.2 dB (postoperative CWW to CWD, p < 0.005). A postoperative air-bone gap result of 0 to 20 dB was achieved as follows: with CWW, in 13 of 36 ears; with CWD, in 2 of 14 ears; and with CWU, in 9 of 22 ears.CONCLUSION: Frequently, a CWW procedure can be substituted for a traditional CWD procedure. In the extended series, the CWW technique continued to provide hearing results similar to CWU rather than to CWD procedures in a young population who will bear the surgical outcome for many decades.

T1  - Detection of postoperative relapsing/residual cholesteatomas with diffusion-weighted echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the capability of echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (EPI-DWI) in diagnosing relapsing/residual cholesteatomas after canal wall-up mastoidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a blinded study design, we investigated with MRI, including standard spin-echo sequences, 18 patients evaluated with clinical examination and computed tomography (CT) suspected for relapsing/residual cholesteatoma 7 to 19 months after a canal wall-up mastoidectomy. Images were evaluated by two radiologists blinded to patients' identities, CT findings, and clinical data set, who decided in a consensus agreement whether there was a pathologic signal increase in the petrous bone in a single-shot EPI-DWI sequence. All the patients underwent a second tympanoplasty or revision surgery of the mastoidectomy cavity within 15 days after magnetic resonance investigation.Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were evaluated separately for standard sequences and EPI-DWI.RESULTS: In EPI-DWI, five of six patients with cholesteatoma showed a bright signal, whereas those patients with a noncholesteatomatous tissue showed no anomalies. The only misdiagnosed cholesteatoma was a pearl 2 mm in diameter. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values, and negative predictive values of EPI-DWI in diagnosing relapsing/residual cholesteatomas were 86, 100, 100, and 92%, respectively.CONCLUSION: EPI-DWI may be a useful tool in differentiating between cholesteatomatous and noncholesteatomatous tissues after closed cavity mastoidectomy. Further investigations are, however, required to establish the practical utility of EPI-DWI on larger series as a screening modality in the follow-up after closed cavity mastoidectomies.

T1  - Postauricular periosteal-pericranial flap for mastoid obliteration and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe an effective technique for mastoid cavity obliteration in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy for chronic otitis media and review its efficacy in producing a dry, low-maintenance, small mastoid cavity.DESIGN: : Retrospective clinical study of a consecutive series of procedures from 1995 to 2000.SETTING: Tertiary referral center and institutional academic practice in otology and neurotology.PATIENTS: Sixty consecutive procedures for active chronic otitis media with a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean, 31 mo; range, 12-80 mo).INTERVENTION: All patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty including split-thickness skin grafting. An inferiorly pedicled, periosteal-pericranial flap was used in conjunction with autologous bone pate to obliterate the mastoid cavity. The additional length provided by the pericranial extension of the flap permitted it to reach superior to the lateral canal and into the sinodural angle, with improved coverage of bone pate and better reduction of cavity size.OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was control of suppuration and creation of a dry, low-maintenance mastoid cavity, which was assessed using a previously developed semiquantitative scale. This scale includes a temporal dimension to assess control of infection. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative complications (i.e., hematoma, infection, flap necrosis, and meatal stenosis) and incidence of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Forty-nine ears (82%) maintained a small, dry, healthy mastoid cavity. Five ears (8%) had intermittent otorrhea easily controlled by topical treatment. Six ears (10%) had suboptimal control of otorrhea, of which four had meatal stenosis. There were no residual or recurrent cholesteatomas. Outcomes remained stable over progressively longer follow-up, up to 80 months.CONCLUSION: Obliteration of a canal wall down mastoid cavity by a postauricular periosteal-pericranial flap with autologous bone pate is a reliable and effective technique that results in a dry, trouble-free mastoid cavity in 90% of patients with active chronic otitis media.

T1  - Transfacial recess ossicular reconstruction: technique and early results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to present the technique of transfacial recess ossicular chain reconstruction (TFROCR) for potential use in selected patients with cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: The author conducted a retrospective case review of all candidates for TFROCR between August 1998 and March 2003.SETTING: A tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: At first-stage tympanomastoidectomy, 22 ears (21 patients; 8 children and 13 adults) with cholesteatoma and ossicular discontinuity were identified as candidates for TFROCR. Seven patients had undergone previous tympanomastoid surgery.INTERVENTION: The first stage included canal wall up mastoidectomy with resection of disease, wide opening of the facial recess, cartilage graft tympanoplasty, and placement of silicone elastomer in the middle ear. Approximately 6 months later, patients underwent a second-stage postauricular procedure. Endoscopes were used to inspect the middle ear through the facial recess. When possible, TFROCR was then performed without elevating a tympanomeatal flap.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Variations in anatomy, disease control, and hearing results were studied.RESULTS: Of the 22 candidate ears, 17 successfully underwent TFROCR, whereas 5 required traditional second-stage procedures with canal incisions. There were no surgical complications. Early hearing results are promising with an average air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. There have been no early failures from recurrent disease or prosthesis displacement.CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients, TFROCR could be safe and effective for disease control and hearing restoration. It could provide for optimal prosthesis placement and almost immediate hearing improvement, avoiding the need for canal incisions, middle ear packing, and dry ear precautions. One must consider the potential risk of missing residual disease secondary to limited exposure.

T1  - The use of demineralized bone matrix for mastoid cavity obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of demineralized bone matrix as a graft material for mastoid cavity obliteration in the treatment and prevention of problematic mastoid cavities.STUDY DESIGN: The study is a retrospective review of patients identified using a computerized otology database.SETTING: Tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: Patients were included in this study if they underwent mastoid obliteration using demineralized bone matrix.INTERVENTION: Mastoid obliteration was performed for revision of a problematic mastoid cavity (n = 8) or primarily after canal wall down mastoidectomy for recurrent cholesteatoma (n = 3).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data were collected to evaluate the ability to achieve a dry ear canal. Postoperative healing time and hearing results were also assessed.RESULTS: A dry ear canal was achieved in all patients with a follow-up of 6 to 20 months (average, 14.5 mo). Eight patients (73%) had a well-healed, dry ear canal by their first postoperative visit (9 wk). One patient required 12.5 weeks to heal. Two patients (18%) had more prolonged granulation at the ear canal incision, which resolved in 17 and 28 weeks, respectively. The average preoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap was 47 +/- 14.9 dB (mean +/- SD), compared with postoperative values of 27.6 +/- 12.8 dB (p = 0.0033; paired t test). This represents an average pure-tone average air-bone gap closure of 20 dB.CONCLUSION: The use of demineralized bone matrix as a graft extender in mastoid obliteration allowed creation of a dry, smooth-contoured canal in all patients studied. A significant improvement in hearing was also obtained. Demineralized bone matrix is an acceptable graft alternative for mastoid obliteration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of intraoperative otoendoscopy as a factor that could influence surgical decision-making in cholesteatoma surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material of this study included 82 ears with acquired cholesteatoma that were operated on. They were divided into 4 groups according to the surgical technique chosen and the use of the endoscope. Group I included 22 ears that underwent canal wall-down (CWD) tympanomastoid surgery, group II included 20 ears that underwent CWD tympanomastoid surgery with intraoperative use of endoscopy, group III included 20 ears that underwent canal wall-up (CWU) tympanomastoid surgery, and group IV included 20 ears that underwent CWU tympanomastoid surgery with intraoperative use of endoscopy. Endoscopy was used as a complementary tool to microscopy. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 48 months.RESULTS: Intraoperative remnants of cholesteatoma matrix were detected during both CWU and CWD by the use of the rigid endoscope. However, its incidence was higher in the CWU group (50%) than in the CWD (30%) group. Most of these remnants were in the sinus tympani (37.5%). The mean duration of follow-up was 18.19 (+/-8.7) months. Postoperative residual cholesteatoma was much higher in the CWU group (25%) than in the CWD group (5%). All residuals were from groups of patients in whom intraoperative endoscopy was not used in the primary surgery.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the use of the endoscope gave the surgeon better control over the pathology, thus achieving better eradication. Stated differently, the use of the endoscope raised the surgeon's confidence level about total removal and thus encouraged the surgeon to keep the canal wall intact while removing cholesteatoma in hidden areas. Therefore, the use of endoscope could be considered an additional tool that may affect decision-making in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Cartilage palisades in type III tympanoplasty: anatomic and functional long-term results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term anatomic and functional results after partial and total autologous cartilage palisade type III tympanoplasties to assess the efficacy of cartilage palisades in preventing recurrent cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective data bank and patient review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: The study population included all patients with more than 36 months follow-up who underwent tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy for previously untreated cholesteatoma using partial or total autologous cartilage palisade graft associated with a reconstruction of the ossicular chain from October 1, 1992, to October 31, 1998.INTERVENTION: Tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy using autologous cartilage palisade graft for partial or total reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and the ossicular chain.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomic results, i.e., closure of the perforation, rate of retraction pockets, recurrent cholesteatoma, and reperforation rate related to the use of autologous cartilage were clinically evaluated. Postoperative speech reception thresholds, speech discrimination scores, and postoperative air-bone gap were compared with preoperative levels. The outcomes of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures were compared.RESULTS: Closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 98.3% of patients. Speech reception thresholds did not change significantly. Speech discrimination scores were stable or improved in all patients. Postoperative air-bone gap was less than 10 dB in 29.8% of patients and between 11 and 20 dB in 32.3%. The complication rate of the tympanoplasty in general was 0.67%. The rate of recurrences of cholesteatoma was 2.2%. No complications could be related to the use of cartilage.CONCLUSIONS: The cartilage palisade technique is effective for the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and also prevents new retractions and recurrences of cholesteatoma. The functional results show that autologous cartilage grafts are able to transmit sound.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula as a late complication of middle ear surgery using the canal wall down technique
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical features of labyrinthine fistulae occurring as a late complication of middle ear surgery using the canal wall down technique.STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of the past 23 years, conducted at a single tertiary care center. The authors evaluated the backgrounds, clinical features, and surgical findings in 25 patients with labyrinthine fistulae, who had a history of ear surgery using the canal down technique and who underwent a second operation at their hospital.INTERVENTIONS: All the patients underwent revision surgery because of persistent or recurrent vertigo caused by labyrinthine fistulae, circumscribed labyrinthitis, or suppurative labyrinthitis.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical features of this disease entity were assessed by history, surgical findings, and the results of audiovestibular testing.RESULTS: The patients had a long history of repetitive postoperative aural discharge before experiencing vertigo, which initially occurred 4 to 64 years (average, 20.2 years) after the previous operation. At the first visit to the authors' clinic, the results of a fistula test conducted with a Politzer's bulb were positive in 14 patients and negative in 5 patients. In the remaining 6 ears, pressure loading of the ear canal induced the sensation of vertigo without accompanying nystagmus. Surgical intervention showed that the fistulae were located at the lateral semicircular canal in 19 ears, at the footplate of the stapes in 4 ears, and at the promontory in 2 ears. Labyrinthine fistulae were closed with conchal cartilage, bone paste (bone dust mixed with fibrin glue), and/or temporalis fascia. In some patients, the fistulae were further covered with pedicled temporalis muscle. In 2 cases complicated by acute suppurative labyrinthitis, the mastoid cavity was obliterated after completion of the labyrinthectomy. The postoperative courses in all patients were uneventful.CONCLUSIONS: A labyrinthine fistula may be created by repeated and insidious infection of a mastoid cavity that has been exposed to the outside during canal wall down surgery. Intensive care of the opened mastoid cavity is essential to avoid this late complication.

T1  - Value of ear endoscopy in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the value of ear endoscopy in cholesteatoma surgery and to demonstrate its consequence in improving surgical outcome.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 92 ears with acquired cholesteatoma (primary or secondary) were operated on. In this prospective study, 82 cases were operated on by using canal wall up (CWU) technique, and 10 cases were on operated on by using canal wall down (CWD) procedure. Endoscopically guided ear surgery was incorporated complementary to the microscope as a principal part in the procedure. Second-look endoscopic exploration was performed on some selected cases, depending on the finding during the primary surgery and the postoperative findings of clinical and computed tomographic studies.RESULTS: In the primary surgery after completion of microscopic cleaning, the overall incidence of intraoperative residuals detected with the endoscope was 22.8%. Sinus tympani was the most common site of intraoperative residuals in both CWU and CWD groups, followed by the facial recess and the undersurface of the scutum in the CWU cases. Reconstruction of the hearing mechanism was performed in the primary surgery in 86 cases (93.5%) and postponed to the second stage in only six cases (6.5%). Out of the 82 CWU cases, 35 second-look endoscopic explorations (42.7%) were performed. Three recurrences (8.6%) were identified. Two cases showed a tiny residual cholesteatoma pearl, and the third showed a larger open residual cholesteatoma filling the sinus tympani and extending to the aditus. In this series, no morbidity or complication was encountered secondary to the use of endoscopes in the mastoid or middle ear.CONCLUSION: Incorporating the endoscope into the surgical armamentarium in otology contributes much to the concept of minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive endoscopic ear surgery should be accepted as a new horizon in ear surgery. In this study, it became obvious that despite the use of the endoscope in conjunction with the operating microscope, 100% eradication of the disease still could not be achieved; however, the use of endoscopes did reduce the residual cholesteatoma rate.

T1  - Canal-down mastoidectomy: experience in 81 cases
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the common presentation(s) and the clinical and operative finding(s) in patients with cholesteatomatous and long-term noncholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media and to adapt a surgical management best suited to ensure long-term safety in these Papua New Guinean patients for whom postoperative follow-up is minimal.DESIGN: Retrospective case series.SETTING: Port Moresby General Hospital, the tertiary referral center for otolaryngologic services.PATIENTS: Eighty-one patients in all age groups who received a clinical diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma, with or without its associated complications.INTERVENTION: Canal-down (modified radical) mastoidectomy with wide meatoplasty.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE AND RESULTS: Adults were more commonly affected than adolescent or pediatric cases, and there was a male preponderance. The median age was 24 years (range, 13 months to 73 years). Otorrhea remained the most common presentation in all age groups. Postauricular abscesses and fistulae were seen frequently. Cholesteatoma and granulation with polypoidal mucosa were frequent operative findings; a high incidence involved both the attic space and the antrum. Five (6%) patients had preoperative facial paralysis; in addition, postoperative facial paralysis developed in three (4%) patients. The incidence of postoperative "wet ear" was high in all age groups. Meningitis was the most common intracranial complication, followed by lateral sinus thrombosis. There were seven (9%) deaths altogether, and all the deaths occurred as a direct result of otogenic intracranial complication.CONCLUSION: Lack of health consciousness, poor socioeconomic status, and lack of health care delivery system resulted in late presentations and poor postoperative follow-up. Hence, the canal-wall-down technique with wide meatoplasty is recommended to ensure a best possible one-time treatment in Papua New Guinean patients with cholesteatomatous or long-term "dangerous" chronic suppurative otitis media with or without complications.

T1  - Recent outcome of tympanoplasty in the elderly
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome of tympanoplasty in the elderly (patients older than 60 years) compared with younger patients.PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 87 (28.3%) older patients among a total of 307 patients with chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma who were surgically treated at a university hospital by the senior author. Follow-up was systematically provided at the same institution.INTERVENTIONS: Surgery included tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy performed as the primary procedure in 358 ears. Tympanoplasty was performed with canal-wall-up or canal-wall-down with canal wall reconstruction, ossiculoplasty with autologous or homologous ossicle interposition or columella. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 12-70 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative air- and bone-conduction thresholds were calculated as an average of three speech frequencies (0.5, 1, and 2 kHz). Analysis was subsequently carried out on the postoperative air-bone gap, hearing gain, and postoperative problems such as elevation of the bone-conduction threshold, delayed epithelialization, and reperforation of the eardrum. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square or Student's t-test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS: Compared with results from younger patients, there was no particular disadvantage in postoperative hearing results and complications in the elderly, although preoperative bone-conduction thresholds were gradually worsened with age.CONCLUSIONS: There is no contraindication for tympanoplasty in older patients if their physical status is the same or better than what is normal for their chronological age.

T1  - Surgical strategy for cholesteatoma in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We reviewed our experience with childhood cholesteatoma in children under 15 years old. Based on cumulative postoperative data, we propose a modified canal-wall-up technique in conjunction with a planned, staged operation.METHODS: From 1982 to 1997, 56 children with cholesteatoma (58 ears, total) underwent surgery in our department. In the early period (1982-1990), canal wall-down mastoidectomy was performed in 52% (21 of 40 ears), and canal wall-up mastoidectomy in 48% (the remaining 19 ears). In the late period (1991-1997), 18 ears with cholesteatoma underwent surgery. The canal-wall up mastoidectomy was performed in 89% (16 ears), and canal-wall-down mastoidectomy in the remaining 11% (two ears).RESULTS: In the early period (1982-1990), cholesteatoma recurred more frequently in the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy group than in the canal-wall down mastoidectomy group (53 vs. 14%). Other postoperative complications, such as erosion of the mastoid cavity, otorrhea, and perforation of the eardrum, occurred more frequently in the canal-wall-down mastoidectomy group than in the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy group. In the late period (1991-1997), in the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy group, ten ears underwent one-stage surgery. Planned staged tympanoplasty was completed in six ears. After one-stage surgery, four of ten ears experienced residual cholesteatoma. Two of the recurrent ears had undergone planned staged tympanoplasty. As revealed by postoperative computed tomography (CT) images, 12 of 15 ears had aeration in the attic and antrum as well as in the tympanic cavity. In these cases, no attic retraction pocket formation was observed.CONCLUSION: Our strategy for pediatric cholesteatoma in the future is to use canal-wall-up mastoidectomy when possible. If aeration in the attic and antrum is observed by preoperative CT-scan image and no erosion in the malleus and incus exists, the one-stage surgery will be chosen. If no aeration is observed by CT-scan and/or erosion exists in the surgical findings, planned staged tympanoplasty will be necessary. This strategy allows a high incidence of aeration of the attic and antrum, and prevents the formation of the attic retraction pocket while enabling the early detection of residual cholesteatoma by means of CT.

T1  - Ten-year results of canal wall down mastoidectomy for acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine 10-year results of canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) for acquired cholesteatoma.METHODS: Medical records of 136 patients with cholesteatoma who has undergone CWDM in a university hospital and who had a follow-up of at least 10 years were checked.RESULTS: During follow-up, 21% of patients had undergone one revision operation and 3% two revisions. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 17% and in three patients the cholesteatoma recurred twice. Ten years after CWDM, 98% of the operated ears were dry, 1% moist, and one ear (0.7%) was discharging. The tympanic membrane was intact in 92% and perforated in 8%. Only 14% of patients had hearing levels of 20 dB or better and 46% had 40 dB or better.CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the surgical technique of CWDM should be improved in order to lower the recurrence rate and to improve hearing results.

T1  - Surgical control of the mastoid segment in chronic ear disease in 1988
AB  - The basic surgical guidelines for mastoid segment control are described in chronic ear disease. Dense cortical bone pate and mastoid tip bone chips are collected for possible obliteration of the surgical cavity produced. A meatally based musculoperiosteal flap is raised if "canal wall-down" surgery is anticipated. Mastoid bone surgery must be meticulous and the sigmoid, cerebellar and dural plates are first exposed. This is followed by a perilabyrinthine dissection. Tympanic or epitympanic surgery is connected with mastoidectomy as needed. All cavities are then obliterated.

T1  - Incidence of attic retraction after staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Incidence of retraction pocket and recurrent cholesteatoma in the attic after surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma using the staged intact canal wall technique were investigated in 95 ears of 91 patients, all of which had various degrees of bone defect in the tympanic scutum. Surgical procedures employed in the second stage for prevention of attic retraction were classified into three types: Type I, no scutumplasty; Type II, scutumplasty; Type III, scutumplasty plus mastoid obliteration. In 83 ears followed up for more than 1 year after the second stage, such retraction troubles occurred in 2 of 13 ears (15%) in Type I, 8 of 20 ears (40%) in Type II, and 24 of 50 ears (48%) in Type III. Incidence of retraction troubles was higher in Types II and III, probably because these procedures were indicated in ears with large scutum defects. Dislocation and atrophy of the graft materials, together with bone resorption around the bone defect were the main reasons for failure in scutumplasty. Dysfunction of the eustachian tube and traction of the eardrum by the scar tissue behind it may have also contributed to attic retraction. Mastoid obliteration with small blocks of hydroxyapatite was more effective in prevention of retraction troubles than that with pedicled temporalis muscle flap.

T1  - Canalplasty for chronic tympanic membrane atelectasis
AB  - PURPOSE: Canalplasty to prevent accumulation of squamous debris has been proposed as an alternative to tympanoplasty for the treatment of tympanic membrane atelectasis and early cholesteatoma. The goal of this article is to report our experience with canalplasty for the treatment of advanced middle ear atelectasis.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all patients that underwent tympanoplasty or canalplasty at the University of Florida since 1992. Eight ears (seven patients) with severe atelectasis were found to have been treated with canalplasty (without middle ear reconstruction) to marsupialize the retraction pockets.RESULTS: Follow-up was conducted at an average of 22 months. Four ears required repeat surgical intervention after an average of 12 months: three required canal wall down mastoidectomies for cholesteatoma, and a tympanoplasty was necessary in one case for persistent perforation. Four ears not requiring revision were without cholesteatoma or perforation at an average follow-up time of 26 months. Mean audiometric thresholds were stable or improved, irrespective of the need for revision surgery.CONCLUSIONS: Canalplasty may be an alternative for the treatment of atelectasis in selected patients; however, close follow-up after surgery is necessary because of the potential for progression to cholesteatoma.

T1  - Results of bone conduction following surgery for chronic ear disease
AB  - Preoperative and postoperative bone conduction thresholds were compared in 181 chronic ears operated on over a 5-year period between 1990 to 1994. In the majority (92%) of cases the bone conduction thresholds remained unchanged (+/-10 dB). Nine ears (5%) showed better thresholds after surgery, with improvements ranging from 11 dB to 25 dB. This improvement was especially noted in ears with severe tympanic pathology. One ear with a large labyrinthine fistula became totally deaf after surgery. In 5 ears (3%) bone-conduction thresholds deteriorated, but remained measurable at all frequencies tested. In these latter cases this impairment ranged from 11 dB to 27 dB. Cholesteatomatous ears having intact ossicular chains were found to be at the highest risk of inner ear damage when "canal wall-down" mastoidectomies were performed. Methods for prevention of sensorineural hearing loss following chronic ear surgery are discussed.

T1  - Fate of patients with bilateral cholesteatoma
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to assess the clinical and surgical findings and long-term results of therapy in patients treated for bilateral chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 54 patients who underwent mastoid surgery for bilateral acquired cholesteatoma were followed regularly for a mean of 7.9 years (range 2 to 21 years). Results of treatment were compared with the results obtained in 349 patients treated for unilateral acquired cholesteatoma with a mean follow-up of 6.7 years. Hearing level was defined as the mean air conduction threshold at frequencies of 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz. Audiograms obtained the day before operation and at last follow-up examination were used for comparison. Results were analyzed using the t test and chi 2 test.RESULTS: Patients with bilateral cholesteatoma were more likely to be men (60% v 61%) and young (28 years v 38 years). A majority of patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy. Seventy-three percent of patients had ossicular erosion. During follow-up, residual recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 8 ears (7.4%). This compared with a recurrence rate of 8.3% in patients with unilateral cholesteatoma. The mean postoperative air conduction threshold (46.1 dB) was similar to patients with unilateral cholesteatoma (46.6 dB). At last follow-up, 43% of patients with bilateral cholesteatoma had a hearing level of 30 dB or better in their best ear. No patient had bilateral anacusis.DISCUSSION: Cholesteatoma is a burdensome disease. Our 54 patients with bilateral cholesteatoma underwent a total of 125 surgical procedures. Acquired cholesteatoma has a great tendency to recur. Fortunately, this study shows that recurrence is not higher in a group of patients with bilateral cholesteatoma when compared with the unilateral group. Unfortunately, the fate of hearing in patients with bilateral cholesteatoma is not so favorable. Only 19% had hearing levels of 30 dB or better in both ears. Hearing levels of less than 40 dB in one ear was present in 34% of patients. Fortunately, there was no case with severe sensorineural hearing loss as a complication of surgery in the present series. This reflects great efforts directed at reduction of infection preoperatively, avoidance of ossicular manipulation, and preservation of cholesteatoma matrix over fistula when encountered.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: recurrence related to observation period
AB  - From 1965 to 1978, 122 children with cholesteatoma had one-stage surgery. Follow-up examinations were carried out several times, with the last two taking place in 1980/81 and 1985/86. Ninety-eight percent of the children were seen at follow-up; the median observation time was 11 years, with a range of three to 21 years. The increase in recurrence rate with increasing observation time was analyzed. In 1980/81 there was a total recurrence rate of 12 percent of patients, including residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity in 8%, in the attic in 2%, and recurrent cholesteatoma in 2%. In 1985/86 the recurrence rate had increased to 17%, distributed among residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity in 10.6%, in the attic in 1.6%, and recurrent cholesteatoma in 4.8%. The recurrence rate was the same regardless of whether modified canal-wall-up mastoidectomy or canal-wall-down mastoidectomy had been employed. We conclude that cholesteatoma surgery should be individualized according to pathologic findings in the tympanic cavity, tubal function, and size of the mastoid air cell system. Small cholesteatomas confined to the tympanic cavity may be removed by tympanoplasty alone, without mastoidectomy. In ears with adhesive otitis, canal-wall-down mastoidectomy is preferred; and in ears with a reasonably good tubal function and a large air cell system, canal-wall-up mastoidectomy is recommended. The long-term results reported here seem to indicate that, in children, canal-wall-up mastoidectomy is preferable to canal-wall-down mastoidectomy.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration with hydroxyapatite--the value of high resolution CT scanning in detecting recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Mastoid obliteration carries a risk of enclosing cholesteatoma within the mastoid cavity. Using temporal bones obliterated with either muscle or hydroxyapatite granules, the value of high resolution CT scanning in the early detection of 'epithelial pearls' was studied. The results showed that scanning was effective in detecting small epithelial pearls within the cavity obliterated with hydroxyapatite, but not so effective when muscle was used. This is explained by the difference in the CT density between epidermoid cysts and hydroxyapatite allowing the cysts (dark shadows) to be identified easily within a white background. The authors also studied scans performed on 31 ears following mastoid obliteration with hydroxyapatite. There was no residual cholesteatoma in the obliterated area but there was an area of abnormality identified within the obliterated area in one patient due to a cholesterol granuloma.

T1  - The use of hydroxyapatite granules in mastoid obliteration
AB  - The problems of open radical mastoid cavities are well known. One of the ways to manage such problems is obliteration of the mastoid cavity. Most biological materials, such as muscle flap or bone chips/paste, tend to be resorbed with time, resulting in reformation of the cavity. The author reports a series of 34 mastoid obliteration operations using hydroxyapatite granules and an inferiorly based periosteal flap. The follow-up period was between 1 and 5 years. The obliterated cavities remained small, stable and trouble-free. Water was tolerated in the cavities allowing most patients to enjoy water sports. Only one patient had permanent discharge due to incomplete epithelialization of the obliterated cavity.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery today
AB  - Four present-day surgical techniques are reviewed to assess their respective merits in surgery for cholesteatoma. The oldest method with an open cavity in ears with mastoid extension of cholesteatoma if combined with partial obliteration is still suitable for less experienced surgeons. Transcanal atticotympanotomy is suitable for limited epitympanic and tympanic cholesteatomas as long as it provides a direct view of the operative field. In similar ears, canal wall up surgery is employed if, additionally, mastoidectomy is needed because of chronic inflammation. Canal wall down surgery with full cavity obliteration with a musculoperiosteal flap, bone chips and bone pate should be the method of choice for all cholesteatomas extending beyond the facial nerve canal. The canal skin is kept as an intact tube and provides quick healing. Open cavities should be revised using similar obliteration techniques but, because of the lack of an intact canal skin tube, making use of a large modified Korner skin flap.

T1  - Comparison of the otoendoscopic and microscopic anatomy of the middle ear cleft in canal wall-up and canal wall-down temporal bone dissections
AB  - This study was designed to compare the accessibility of particular anatomical sites in the middle ear cleft in five canal wall-up and five canal wall-down temporal bone dissections, using 0 and 70 degree otoendoscopes and the microscope. In all five canal wall-up dissections, otoendoscopy gave good visualization of all sites of the middle ear cleft whereas microscopy failed to give adequate visualization of the sinus tympani and protympanum. In all five canal wall-down dissections otoendoscopy again allowed good visualization of all sites whereas microscopy did not permit visualization of the sinus tympani. It is well known that residual cholesteatoma is most frequently found in the sinus tympani, therefore this makes the otoendoscope an essential adjunct to the microscope in canal wall-up and canal wall-down surgery.

T1  - Bacteriological studies after obliterative mastoid operations
AB  - This study evaluates the post-operative bacteriology and the clinical state of postoperatively infected ears which were operated on using obliterative techniques and relates these bacteriological findings with the disease present. Out of the 85 ears with post-operative infection, the discharge was mucous in nine ears, mucopurulent in 18 ears, and seropurulent in 34 ears. Twenty-four ears were moist. Epitympanal or antral cholesteatoma was noticed in seven ears and meso- or hypotympanal cholesteatoma in 12 ears. The post-operative Valsalva-test was positive in 61 ears and negative in 24 ears. The types of bacteria did not significantly depend on the quality of the post-operative discharge, existence of post-operative cholesteatoma, or clinical function of the Eustachian tube (estimated by the Valsalva test). This study indicates that the bacteriology of the post-operatively moist or discharging ear does not significantly depend of the clinical state of the ear, nor can it be predicted on the basis of the clinical picture of the ear. A bacteriological examination of the ear seems to be the only way to control chemotherapy properly.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: a comparison of closed and open techniques in a follow-up of 164 ears
AB  - In the Malmo community (230,000 inhabitants) 188 ears with cholesteatoma were operated on during 1975-1981. This number corresponds to an incidence of 12 cholesteatomas per 100,000 inhabitants a year. A detailed follow-up was possible in 164 ears. The primary operation was performed with an intact canal wall technique (CAT) in 148 ears and a radical operation in 40 ears. A planned second look was performed in 138 of the CAT ears and residual cholesteatoma was found in 41 or 30%, mainly in the epitympanic space. An initially good healing and hearing result was obtained in 71% but in the course of time several ears developed new retractions and a new mastoid cholesteatoma. The number of ears with perfect hearing tended to decrease with time, but about one-third of CAT ears remained intact with good hearing. The CAT technique is preferable in ears with a large mastoid air cell system and when the cholesteatoma is easily accessible by the approach. A planned second look should be performed including ossiculoplasty and obliteration of the antrum. In the remaining cases a radical operation including middle ear reconstruction and obliteration of the mastoid cavity is preferred.

T1  - Anatomical and functional reconstruction of old radical mastoidectomy cavities by obliteration tympanoplasty
AB  - One hundred and seventeen patients who had previous radical mastoidectomies, atticotomies or Bondy operations were operated on between 1973 and 1984. An open technique with obliteration and traction meatoplasty was used in one stage in 19 ears (normal mucosa in mesotympanum) and in 2 stages in 98 ears (poor mesotympanum which needed to be dissected and covered with silastic sheeting). The second stage was performed 12 to 18 months later. Closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 93% of ears at the first stage. In 6 ears out of 81 second stages, residual cholesteatoma was found in the mesotympanum. No residual cholesteatoma was subsequently observed behind the flap but only 4 ears were checked behind the flap at the second stage. An air-bone gap within 20 dB was achieved in 85% of ears if the stapes was intact and surgery was performed in one stage, and in 55% of ears of the stapes was intact and surgery performed in 2 stages. If the crura were missing, an air-bone gap within 20 dB was achieved in 57% of ears in 2 stages.

T1  - Surgery for chronic ear disease in a non-university hospital: open cavity, obliteration and intact canal wall techniques
AB  - The long-term results of surgery for chronic suppurative middle ear disease at a non-university ENT-clinic (Vasa Central Hospital, Finland) are reported. The material consisted of 273 ears, 65 of which had been operated on by open cavity techniques, 178 by the original Palva obliteration method, and 30 by the intact canal wall method. Post-operative cholesteatoma occurred equally frequently with the two canal wall down methods (7.7 and 7.3%, respectively) but was more frequent after intact canal wall surgery (23.3%). Hearing was better and the infection rate lower with obliteration than with open cavity techniques. Post-operative infection was the least frequent and the hearing result best in the intact canal wall ears, but compared to the other two groups the extent of disease found at surgery was considerably less in this group. The obliteration operation proved to be a safe method in the hands of a practising otologist outside university clinics.

T1  - Paediatric small cavity mastoid surgery: second look tympanotomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Following surgery for retraction pocket/cholesteatoma there is risk of residual disease, after canal wall up surgery a second look tympanotomy is routinely recommended. After canal wall down (CWDM) surgery this is not routine. In certain situations the senior author recommends second look tympanotomy. This report examines the outcome of this management paradigm applied to small cavity mastoid surgery for children.METHOD: A retrospective review of small cavity mastoid surgery for children with cholesteatoma or discharging retraction pocket disease. The primary procedure and surgical findings at second look tympanotomy are reported as well as the pre- and 1 year post-operative air and bone conduction thresholds and air-bone gap averaged across frequencies 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz and the mean pre- and post-operative bone conduction threshold at 4kHz. A Student t-test was used to compare hearing results.RESULTS: Forty five were children reviewed at 1 year. Twelve (27%) were recommended second look tympanotomy, of which 10 had surgery; all were free of residual disease. At second look two children had ossiculoplasty performed, four had adhesions divided. Six children had formed a myringostapediopexy after their first surgery. The mean pre-op bone conduction threshold was 6.3dB for those having single stage surgery and 5.6dB for those having a second look and the post-operative thresholds were 7.8 and 10.2dB, respectively. The mean preoperative air conduction threshold was 32.6dB for single stage surgery and 31.1dB for staged surgery and at 1 year 29.2 and 40.8dB. This was a significant difference. After second look, the air conduction threshold was 34.5dB, and not significantly different from those who had single stage surgery. The mean pre-treatment 4kHz bone conduction threshold was 6.3 and 5.6dB for single stage surgery and second look tympanotomy and after surgery, respectively, 9.8 and 14.5dB. These changes are not statistically significant.CONCLUSION: The small cavity mastoidectomy approach allows meticulous removal of disease from the middle ear and for certain indications second look tympanotomy is recommended. Planned second look tympanotomy has demonstrated excellent early disease control as well as allowing timely management of any pathology affecting the middle ear sound transformation mechanism.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To present our experience in the surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical trial.PATIENTS AND METHOD: Charts of 114 patients who met the inclusion criteria of the study were examined. Surgical results were compared with respect to applied surgical methods. Cholesteatoma recidivism (CR) and hearing improvement were the main parameters which were examined.RESULTS: The mean age was 13 years and mean follow-up period was 3.7 years. A total of 200 operations performed on 114 children: 114 children operated at the first stage, 84 children underwent a second surgery, and 2 a third surgery. At initial operation; canal wall-up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy was the choice of surgical procedure in 35 (31%) patients, and canal wall-down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy was preferred for the other 79 (69%) patients. At final analysis; 26 of 114 (23%) patients had CWU procedure, 67 patients (59%) had CWD procedure and 21 patients (18%) had radical mastoidectomy. (CR) rate was 26 and 16%, respectively for CWU and CWD procedures for initial surgeries (P = 0.248). Hearing improvement was achieved in 36% of CWU procedures and 38% of CWD procedures (P = 0.957). Hearing deterioration was observed in 36% of CWU procedures and 47% of CWD procedures (P = 0.328).CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between CWU and CWD procedures with respect to CR, hearing improvement, and hearing deterioration. Therefore, choose of surgical procedure should be individualized for each patient. In our opinion; open techniques must be employed in the presence of extensive disease, whereas the closed technique is reserved for those with a more localized problem.

T1  - One-stage revision surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma: long-term results and comparison with primary surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies report on revision surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma, even if most studies of primary surgery show high recurrence rates. We present independently evaluated long-term results of revision surgery and compare the results with those of primary surgery.METHODS: The series consisted of 42 consecutive pediatric (age <16 years) cholesteatoma revision operations in the Helsinki University ENT Department. The primary and revision surgery was non-staged, all mastoids were obliterated and the bony ear canals were reconstructed. The preoperative, surgical and annual control data were recorded in a database. The last control was independently performed (J.S.) with an average follow-up of 4.3 years and 87% attendance.RESULTS: The recurrence rate for revision operations was 38%. A retraction process developed in 38% of the ears and 67% of these retractions turned into active cholesteatomas. There was a non-significant difference for these figures as compared with primary surgery. Postoperative discharge and poor middle ear ventilation were associated with recurrence. The following factors showed significant differences between primary and revision surgery: increased number of bare facial nerve in the revision group, lower recurrence rate for experienced surgeons (as for both groups together) and improved hearing results for ears without recurrence in the revision group.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent disease after revision surgery appears either in the attic or in the mesotympanum, or develops from a retraction pocket in a similar manner as was seen in patients receiving primary surgery. Recurrence is associated with discharging and poorly ventilated ears. Pediatric cholesteatoma surgery should be done or be supervised by experienced surgeons. The present operation methods result in many recurrences after primary and revision surgery. New surgical methods are needed to create additional aeration pathways to the epitympanum in order to improve middle ear aeration and to prevent some of the retractions.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: techniques and results
AB  - A retrospective analysis of the medical records of all cases of cholesteatoma in children treated between 1981 and 1996 was performed. The charts of 59 children with cholesteatoma were reviewed. A total of 62 ears received surgery over 15 years. The median follow-up period was 5 years. There were 132 operations. An intact canal wall (ICW) procedure was performed in 29% of the ears in the first stage, a canal wall down (CWD) procedure in 37%, a transmeatal atticotomy (TA) in 21%, a tympanoplasty (T) in 6.5% and a myringoplasty (M) in 6.5% of the ears. The ICW procedure had a higher rate of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma than did CWD (P=0.8), TA (P=0.4), T (P=0.5), and M (P=0.05). The CWD procedure had a lower rate than TA (P=0.7), but a higher rate than T (P=0.6) and M (P=0.09). Lastly, TA had a higher rate than T (P=0.7) and M (P=0.1). Auditory results were similar for type II and type III reconstructions (P=0.5). An air-bone gap of less than 20 dB was achieved in 51% of the ears, and 80% had a gap of less than 40 dB. We found a clear difference, although not statistically significant, in the personal rate of recurrent cholesteatoma. It was 26% for surgeons who had performed more than 350 otological surgeries and fell to 15% for the most-experienced surgeon (1715 operations). It rose to 34% for the less experienced surgeons (P=0.8). We recommend that surgery for children with cholesteatoma be reserved for experienced surgeons.

T1  - Pediatric one-stage cholesteatoma surgery: long term results
AB  - The long-term results of pediatric cholesteatoma are dispersed and there is no consensus on operation methods and on factors affecting outcome of surgery. We analyzed the independently evaluated long-term results and possible reasons for recholesteatoma. Eighty-four consecutive pediatric (age < 16 years) cholesteatoma operations were undertaken in the Helsinki University Central Hospital ENT Department. The operations were not staged; all mastoids were obliterated and bony ear canals reconstructed without open cavities. The pre- and perioperative and annual control data were recorded in a database. The last control was independently performed (J.S.) with an average follow-up of 4.8 years and 87% attendance. The total recholesteatoma rate was 29% (24/84), and it was not dependent on the size of cholesteatoma, mastoid status, cholesteatoma in the window niches or stapedial erosion. A retraction process developed in 25% (21/84) of the ears and 42% (9/21) of these turned into retraction pocket cholesteatomas as late as 13 years postoperatively. Retractions and postoperative discharge, especially in combination, predisposed to recholesteatoma. Of the healed ears, 37% became atelectatic. Hearing was maintained on the preoperative level. Reduced middle ear and attic ventilation led to retractions, and atelectasis and a tendency to discharge accelerated the process. Pitfalls in mastoid obliteration and attic reconstruction and the failure to create new ventilation routes were important reasons for recholesteatoma.

T1  - Tympano-ossicular allografts for cholesteatoma in children
AB  - At the Sint Augustinus Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium, all children with cholesteatoma are operated by a canal wall up approach and immediate reconstruction with a tympano-ossicular allograft. In the majority of the cases, a second stage is performed after 1 year. This paper presents the results of a retrospective review of the charts of 103 consecutive children treated between 1979 and 1995. The mean patient age was 10 years and the mean postoperative follow-up was 4.5 years. In 28 children residual cholesteatoma was found at the second stage operation and 20 developed recurrent cholesteatoma in the course of time. So far no residual cholesteatoma surfaced after the staged procedure, but 11 children needed more than two operations to control recurrent disease. An intact, trouble-free graft was present in 79 children at the latest follow-up. The median postoperative bone-conduction thresholds were equal to the preoperative thresholds. The median postoperative air-conduction thresholds improved in 50% of the cases, remained unchanged in 25%, and deteriorated in 25% of the cases. It is concluded that the tympano-ossicular allograft technique is effective and safe and offers good anatomical and acceptable functional results.

T1  - Late results after cholesteatoma surgery in early childhood
AB  - The incidence of cholesteatoma in children living in an urban area of western Sweden has been studied. The total population of this area is 470,000 out of which 100,000 are children, 16 years or younger. The charts of all the children undergoing cholesteatoma surgery during the time period from 1977 to 1986 were collected and analyzed. Only those patients who had not been exposed to cholesteatoma surgery before were included. In a follow-up study the clinical situation and hearing level have been evaluated 4 years or more after surgery. Nineteen patients, that is an incidence of 0.4 children out of 100,000 inhabitants each year, were found meeting these criteria with an irregular distribution over the 10 year period. During the first two years 11 cases were found, but in the following 8 years only 8 new cases were identified. Intact wall tympanoplasty was used in 10 cases and canal wall down operation in 9 cases. Residual cholesteatoma was detected in 6 cases and recurrent cholesteatoma in one case. Six of these had an intact wall tympanoplasty and all but one were later reoperated with a canal wall down approach. The study reveals a decrease in the incidence of cholesteatoma in children over a 10-year period. The more frequent use of tympanometry and otomicroscopy is a possible explanation.

T1  - Long-term results of surgery for childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - The study includes 54 cholesteatomatous ears in 50 children aged 16 years or less. The mean follow-up period after surgery was 7.1 years. In 26% of the ears the cholesteatoma was 'huge' involving the middle ear and the attic and filling the entire mastoid air cell system. A patient had lateral sinus thrombophlebitis. Patients with large cholesteatomas underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty and, in most cases, cavity obliteration. Limited cholesteatomas were removed using either intact canal wall mastoidectomy or tympanotomy approach. Recurrence rate (including both residual and recurrent cholesteatomas) for the total series was 15% and 12% for the 50 cases undergoing one-stage surgery. Serviceable hearing (< or = 30 dB) was achieved in 57% of the ears. A reoperation was necessary in 26% and a third operation in 2%. At last follow-up examination, 94% of the ears had intact tympanic membranes but 4 patients (8%) suffered from cavity-related problems. Possible reasons for the disappointing results of surgical treatment for childhood cholesteatoma are discussed.

AB  - Mastoid obliteration is recommended as a routine procedure in all mastoid surgery. Bone chips from the mastoid tip, bone pate from the cortical bone and lyophilized dura can all be employed effectively to fill the epitympanic space and Traumann's triangle. The former annulus is reconstructed using lyodura and periost-bearing bone and the canal wall is fortified and the cavity filled with the metally based postauricular musculoperiosteal flap. Any remaining cavity is filled with bone chips and bone pate.

T1  - [Clinical study of secondary cholesteatoma]
AB  - Acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is considered to be formed by retraction of the tympanic membrane. There are rare cases in which the tympanic membrane epidermis extends into the medial surface of the tympanic membrane from the margin of its perforation, namely so-called secondary cholesteatoma. We studied the cases of secondary cholesteatoma clinically. These cases were found in 13 of 419 ears (3.1%) with acquired middle ear cholesteatoma operated on in our hospital from March 2001 to October 2010. The average age of all the cases was 51.5 years old, with a range of 11-65 years. We adopted the canal wall down tympanoplasty procedure with canal reconstruction in all cases. The postoperative hearing improvement rate was 84.6%. There were no cases of recurrence of the cholesteatoma.

T1  - [Burow's solution treatment for external auditory canal and mastoid cavity cholesteatoma]
AB  - Burow's solution, 13% aluminum acetate dissolved in water developed as ear drops by German Dr. Karl August Burow in the mid-1800s, was confirmed by Mahoney (1980) and Thorp et al. (2000) to act on chronic suppurative otitis media without ototoxicity. We have found it satisfactory in treating otitis media and other intractable inflammation and fungal infection of the external auditory canal. We report its potent effect in 2 cases of external auditory canal cholesteatoma (EACC) and 1 of mastoid cavity cholesteatoma (MCC)-the first such report insofar as we knew. Case 1 of EACC involved an 8-year-old boy with cholesteatoma debris in a bony groove evidencing defective skin just posteroinferior to the left tympanic membrane. EACC was cured after a single Burow's solution instillation. Case 2 of EACC was a 31-year-old woman whose left ear canal was filled by a keratin mass with pus positive for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and granulation and experiencing otalgia and dysgeusia. Computed tomography (CT) showed that the bony anterior and posterosuperior wall of the external auditory canal had been destroyed. The EACC was removed and Burow's solution instilled once a week, effecting a cure about one month later, leaving the bony groove of the anterior and inferior wall intact and recovering gustatory sensation. Case 3 of MCC was a 47-year-old man undergoing right canal wall down tympanoplasty three times. One year after the last surgery, the mastoid cavity and posterior external canal wall was covered by a cholesteatoma matrix with granulation and pus. Instilling Burow's solution for 5 months resulted in a completely dry cholesteatoma-free cavity. All three subjects had intact tympanic membranes. Burow's solution alone proving effective against EACC and MCC suggests its great usefulness as first-choice conservative therapy. Although this usually cannot completely cure middle-ear and attic cholesteatoma, its effectiveness in cases of EACC and MCC should be recognized in infection and inflammation with cholesteatoma.

T1  - [Clinical study of congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear]
AB  - We studied 35 ears of 34 patients with congenital cholesteatoma who were operated between June 1992 and May 2003, focusing on the localization and progression of congenital cholesteatoma. Patients were 2 to 55 years of age. Congenital cholesteatoma was diagnosed based on two intraoperative findings: 1) no continuity between the tympanic membrane and cholesteatoma, 2) no presence of perforation, retraction, or granulation of the tympanic membrane. All patients had closed-type cholesteatoma, and none formed open-type cholesteatoma, which grows as a flat sheet of epidermis. The primary site of congenital cholesteatoma was classified into 3 types; 1) anterior-superior quadrant, 2) posterior-superior quadrant, and 3) epitympanic, and the origin of these three types of congenital cholesteatoma was difficult to explain by a single theory. We operated on 31 ears by canal wall up tympanoplasty and on 4 ears by canal wall down tympanoplasty. On all but 4 ears, we performed planned-staged operation, including second-look operations, in case of recurrence or residual cholesteatoma. Improvement in hearing after surgery was seen in 22 of the 26 ears treated and followed up for more than 6 months after surgery. By drawing all localization of congenital cholesteatoma in 35 ears, we studied the progression of congenital cholesteatoma and speculated on the original primary site. Congenital cholesteatoma in restricted areas consequently implies good results in hearing after surgery, making earlier diagnosis and treatment desirable.

T1  - Congenital cholesteatoma: classification, management, and outcome
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess whether a classification system for congenital cholesteatoma (CC) can be derived from analysis of a large clinical sample of cases and to assess whether such a classification system is a reliable guide for surgical intervention, reexploration, and hearing outcome.DESIGN: A retrospective review of clinical and surgical records of 119 patients with CC.SETTING: Four tertiary care children's hospitals.PATIENTS: One hundred nineteen children with CC (age range, 2-14 years).RESULTS: Congenital cholesteatomas in the anterior mesotympanum were treated successfully with exploratory tympanotomy. Congenital cholesteatomas involving the posterior superior quadrant and the attic usually had concurrent involvement of the incus and stapes and often required a canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy and a second look for its control. Congenital cholesteatoma involving the mastoid usually involved all of the ossicles, was inconsistently controlled with canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy, and had a poor prognosis for restoration of conductive hearing loss. The mean +/- SD age of children with CC was 5.6 +/- 2.8 years, while that of children with acquired cholesteatoma was 9.7 +/- 3.3 years.CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of spread of CC, involving 3 sites, suggests a natural classification system. The CC usually originates in the anterior superior quadrant, but does not consistently remain there, and may variably occupy the middle ear and mastoid and result in ossicular destruction and conductive hearing loss. The location of CC and the involvement of the ossicles is an accurate predictor of the type of surgery necessary for its control and for the success of hearing restoration.

T1  - [Evaluation of canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction for draining ear with middle ear cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the postoperative stability of canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma with preoperative otorrhea.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 155 ears with middle ear cholesteatoma treated with canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction were evaluated retrospectively. A comparison was made between the group of 80 ears which showed otorrhea, preoperatively, and the group of 75 without preoperative otorrhea. Problems observed in the tympanic membrane or reconstructed external auditory canal were evaluated both at the postoperative initial stage and more than 1 year after surgery. Postoperative hearing prognosis was also studied.RESULTS: 1) In the postoperative initial stage, local infection and necrosis of materials for canal reconstruction were significantly more likely to be observed in ears with preoperative otorrhea. 2) In ears with postoperative local infection, necrosis of materials for canal reconstruction occurred more frequently, and the period until drying of the reconstructed external auditory canal was significantly extended. 3) No significant difference was seen in postoperative status of the tympanic membrane and reconstructed ear canal at least 1 year after surgery. 4) The presence of preoperative otorrhea had no influence on hearing prognosis.CONCLUSIONS: When canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction is used for ears with preoperative otorrhea, careful attention should be paid to local treatment at the postoperative initial stage. However, no significant problem occurred in the outcome of preoperative ear draining at least 1 year after surgery.

T1  - Functional results of Plastipore prostheses for middle ear ossicular chain reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of plastipore prostheses for middle ear ossicular chain reconstruction. Hearing results with total and partial Plastipore ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP and PORP) were evaluated in open- and closed-cavity operations.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of 237 patients who underwent operation for chronic ear disease as well as ossiculoplasty with plastipore prostheses. In order to assess the functional results, only 156 of 237 patients were included in the study. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 46 months.METHODS: Canal wall up and canal wall down operations were performed. Either TORP or PORP ossiculoplasty was performed in each operation. An airbone gap closure to within 20 dB was considered successful.RESULTS: With TORPs, the airbone gap closure to within 20 dB was achieved in 43.1%, and similar results were obtained with PORPs in 63.3%. In canal wall down and canal wall up operations, the success rates were 55.8% and 55.7%, respectively. The best results were obtained with PORPs in canal wall down operations, with a success rate of 82%. The extrusion rate of the prostheses was 4.2%.CONCLUSION: Hearing results of PORPs are better than TORPs. In canal wall up and canal wall down operations similar hearing results are obtained. PORP ossiculoplasty in a canal wall down operation yields the most favorable hearing result.

T1  - Intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Cases of cholesteatoma in pediatric patients were reviewed to determine which factors influence the outcome of surgical treatment. Cholesteatoma is considered a more aggressive disease in children than in adults. The outcomes of intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy and canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy were assessed, as comparisons of different surgical technique.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric cholesteatoma treated at a single institution by the senior author (P.R.L.) over a period of 11 years was conducted.METHODS: Patient information was collected from an otology database, patient records, and audiology files.RESULTS: Sixty-six patients, aged 10 months to 18 years, were treated and followed for an average of 37.7 months (range 12.2 months to 12.5 y). ICW mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty was the primary surgical treatment in 41 patients. Nineteen percent had residual disease at a planned second stage surgery and 22% developed recurrent cholesteatoma for a total recidivism rate of 41%. A SRT of less than 30 dB HL was achieved in 75% of these patients. Seventeen patients underwent CWD mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty initially. Two patients (12%) had residual cholesteatoma found at a planned second state procedure, and no recurrent cholesteatoma was encountered. Seventy-two percent maintained a SRT of less than 30 dB HL.CONCLUSIONS: These results support the continued use of ICW mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for pediatric cholesteatoma. If planned second stage surgery is necessary, the long-term results of an ear with useful hearing and few problems with chronic medical care are gratifying. For reasons of anatomy or in an only hearing ear, CWD mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty provides a safe ear and good hearing results. Mastoid cavity care must be maintained indefinitely in many cases.

T1  - Staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty for treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma were investigated in 202 ears of 197 patients who had undergone surgery by the staged intact canal wall technique. Surgical procedures used in the second stage for prevention of a retraction pocket were classified into three types: Type S1, no scutumplasty; Type S2, scutumplasty; Type S3, scutumplasty plus mastoid obliteration. Recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 9 ears (4%) and retraction pocket in 47 ears (23%). They occurred between 2 and 120 months (average: 26 months) after the second stage, most frequently at 1 to 3 years. The incidence was higher after Type S3 surgery than after the other types, probably because the middle ear was severely involved in patients who were indicated Type S3 surgery. For prevention of a retraction pocket, bone putty and cartilage were proved to be appropriate materials for scutumplasty, and hydroxyapatite for mastoid obliteration. As the retraction pocket tended to recur in patients with the pocket at the second stage, these patients needed obliteration of the mastoid cavity to prevent a retraction pocket. Postoperative hearing was evaluated according to the criteria proposed by the Japan Society of Clinical Otology. Of 145 ears of the 142 patients who were followed for more than 1 year, 118 ears (81%) the surgery was judged successful. The success rate in hearing was in good accordance with the condition of the tympanic membrane.

T1  - Results of tympanoplasty in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the results of tympanoplasty in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia complicated by tympanic perforation or cholesteatoma with hearing loss and/or recurrent otorrhea.DESIGN: Retrospective study. Postoperative follow-up of 26.3 months in the type 1 tympanoplasty group and 46 months in the child with cholesteatoma.SETTING: Hospitalized care, referral center.PATIENTS: Seven children with primary ciliary dyskinesia, complicated in 6 children by 9 tympanic perforations (3 bilateral perforations) and in 1 child by an attical cholesteatoma.RESULTS: After 9 type 1 tympanoplasties, the grafts were intact in 9 ears, with no recurrence of otorrhea, but serous otitis media was present in 6 of the 9 ears. Auditory improvement was significant, with an average gain of 17-dB hearing level in speech frequencies. After a canal wall-down tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for attic cholesteatoma in 1 ear, the cavity that was operated on showed no signs of otorrhea or residual cholesteatoma after a follow-up of 46 months.CONCLUSION: In children with primary ciliary dyskinesia, tympanoplasty has a high probability of graft success and auditory improvement, despite the frequent recurrence of serous otitis media.

T1  - [Long-term results of Feldmann's osteoplastic approach for chronic middle ear disease]
AB  - Between 1978 and 1981, Feldmann's osteopathic approach was often used to manage chronic middle ear disease. In this procedure, the superior and posterior segment of the ear canal wall was cut after complete mastoidectomy, removed temporarily and re-positioned in the previous position after handling the diseased focus in the tympanic isthmus area. Forty-one cases (24 cases of non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media and 17 cases of cholesteatoma) were followed and long-term results of this procedure were studied with regard to re-operative findings following this procedure. Among the 41 patients, 13 (31.7%) required revision surgery because of cholesteatoma formation, infection etc. Seven of these 13 patients (53.8%) required revision surgery because of cholesteatoma formation after this procedure. None of these 7 cases appeared to involve residual cholesteatoma. The most important problem is that 3 of the 7 patients showing cholesteatoma formation had non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media before this procedure. In other words, the Feldmann's osteoplastic approach may iatrogenically induce cholesteatoma formation in non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media. The re-operative findings indicated that the re-positioned canal wall in this procedure may have small bony defects or bony erosion, inducing pocket formation through these defects to create a new cholesteatoma. Although recent literature concerning tympanoplasty recommends posterior canal wall reconstruction using cartilage, bone, ceramic material or bone-pate rather than the canal wall down method, careful follow-up should be continued with regard to pocket formation and/or cholesteatoma formation.

T1  - [Surgical evaluation and clinical features of cholesteatoma in children]
AB  - There are two types of cholesteatoma in children, congenital and acquired. The pathogenesis of each type is thought to be different. The pathogenesis of congenital cholesteatoma is thought to be the embryonic inclusion of squamous epithelium, whereas acquired cholesteatoma is thought to develop from various factors including recurrent otitis media and tubal insufficiency. We reviewed a series of 23 patients with congenital cholesteatoma and 27 patients with acquired cholesteatoma, aged 2-15 years, who were operated on at our institution between January 1981 and December 1990. Planned staged surgery was performed in all patients. In the first-stage operation, the canal-wall-up technique was used in all cases. About 12 months after the first operation, the second-stage operation was performed to investigate the course of the disease. The presence of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma was evaluated at this time. In the congenital cholesteatoma series, 11 cases of residual cholesteatoma (48%) were detected at the second-stage operation. Since recurrent cholesteatoma was not observed in the series of congenital cholesteatoma cases, the prognosis of these cases was considered to be good. On the other hand, in the acquired cholesteatoma series, 9 cases (33%) of recurrent cholesteatoma and 13 (48%) of residual cholesteatoma were detected at the second-stage operation. For the second-stage operation, the canal-wall-up technique was performed on 18 patients with no recurrence, whereas the canal-wall-down technique was used on all 9 patients with recurrence. Additional mastoid obliteration was performed on 7 of these 9 patients. The prognosis of the patients who underwent obliteration was good, and there was no recurrence of cholesteatoma after the second operation. From these observations, it was concluded that planned staged tympanoplasty was useful for eliminating recurrent and residual cholesteatoma. It is also apparent that, in order to prevent recurrent cholesteatoma, it is necessary to reduce the air space to compensate for poor eustachian tube ventilation.

T1  - [Tympanoplasty in cholesteatoma otitis media with normal hearing]
AB  - Thirteen cholesteatomas, with hearing within 20dB, were operated on from 1985 to 1992. Their mean age was 22.1 years, and the mean follow-up period 1.8 years. Eleven cases were pars flaccid type, and 2 cases pars tensa type. Tympanoplasties were performed by the canal down method (4 cases), the canal up method (3 cases), both transmeatal atticotomy and scutumplasty (4 cases) and both the canal down method and mastoid obliteration (2 cases). Postoperative hearing results of three averaged speech frequencies were within 20dB in 11 cases and between 20 and 30dB in 2 cases. No recurrent cholesteatoma or extrusion of columella occurred during the follow-up period. One of the cases operated on by the canal down method showed postoperative mastoid cavity problems, and one of the cases operated on by the canal up method showed retraction of the pars flaccida. These findings prompted us to operate on cholesteatoma cases with normal hearing and to recommend tympanoplasty with transmeatal atticotomy and scutumplasty.

T1  - Delayed diagnosis and fate of congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma)
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze clinical presentation, modes of detection, growth pattern, operative findings, and results of surgery in children 3 years old or older who had extensive congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma).DESIGN: Survey, case series.SETTING: Two academically affiliated medical centers: a children's hospital and an eye, ear, and throat hospital, both located in major metropolitan cities.PATIENTS: Twenty-five children selected according to specified criteria.INTERVENTION: Tympanomastoid surgery, ie, canal wall up and canal wall down, some with ossicular reconstructive surgery.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Audiologic assessment (speech reception threshold) and recurrence (recidivism) of cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Incidence of recidivism, 52%. Hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91% of the patients for whom complete data are available.CONCLUSIONS: Congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa. To adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required. Since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique. Alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close follow-up with otomicroscopy and serial computed tomographic scans.

T1  - Surgical technique for open mastoid procedures
AB  - In mastoid surgery for chronic ear disease (with or without cholesteatoma), the removal of the posterior canal wall does not necessarily insure a "safe" ear. Open procedures are subject to many of the same complications that are associated with the more controversial closed technique. In addition, if the canal wall down procedure is not performed with great care and under strict guidelines, the postoperative ear can be a continual nuisance to the patient. The author has reached these conclusions based upon 20 years' experience in dealing with "problem cavities" created by himself and others. The purpose of this paper is to define the "problem cavity" and how to prevent it.

T1  - Causes of failure of mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media
AB  - The operative findings of 66 patients who underwent revision mastoid surgery for recurrent chronic otitis media were analyzed for the causes of failure of the primary procedures. Recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 41% of the canal wall down and 70% of the canal wall up procedures requiring revision. Additional causes of failure included granulation tissue in unexenterated cells, particularly in the tegmental cells (41% of all cases and 64% of cases without cholesteatoma) and cells of the sinodural angle (38% of all cases and 58% of cases without cholesteatoma). The need for thorough exenteration of cells, particularly the tegmental cells and cells of the sinodural angle, mastoid tip, and facial recess, and the importance of lowering the facial ridge in canal wall down procedures were stressed. Following these principles, the success rate in creating a dry ear in 48 patients who had undergone from one to three previous mastoid procedures was 85% (mean follow-up three years).

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: the influence of the canal wall
AB  - Although there is an increasing awareness of the risks of complications following intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) for cholesteatoma, long-term evidence to support a preference for alternative techniques in which the canal wall having been removed, the resultant cavity is obliterated, is comparatively scarce. In order to clarify this uncertainty, long-term results with both operations have been analyzed to determine incidence rates for postoperative complications and functional results. Recurrent cholesteatoma (retraction pocket) has occurred in 14% of ICWT ears and 1% of ears with mastoid obliteration and tympanic reconstruction. The incidence of clinically detected residual disease with both operations has been extremely low so far, in spite of greater than 20% incidence of epithelial pearls at the second stage of separate planned two-stage procedures with each technique. It is concluded that reduction to the greatest degree possible of cholesteatomatous complications from tympanoplasty necessitates removal of the canal wall.

T1  - Results in resident cholesteatoma surgery: a review of 85 cases
AB  - A review of all patients with cholesteatoma operated on by the residents of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary under the attending supervision of the Otology Service between 1980 and 1984 was done. Of 130 resident cases, 85 had documented follow-up 1 year or longer and were included in the study. Recurrence rates were 18% with canal wall down (CWD) and 43% with canal wall up (CWU) techniques. Considering other forms of failure (such as precholesteatoma, tympanic membrane perforation, and chronic infection), overall failure rates were 33% (CWD) compared with 82% (CWU). Cholesteatoma recurrence failure rates were higher in patients under the age of 20 (33%) than over the age of 20 (19%). Overall failure rates were 61% and 37% for younger and older patients, respectively. Due to the high failure rate with canal wall up techniques in resident hands, it is recommended that resident service cases be treated with canal wall down technique, especially in the younger age group.

T1  - Treatment of sinus cholesteatoma. Long-term results and recurrence rate
AB  - We classified cholesteatomas as attic cholesteatoma, developing from Shrapnell's membrane; tensa cholesteatoma, originating in pars tensa, which is subdivided into tensa retraction cholesteatoma involving the entire pars tensa, and sinus cholesteatomas, developing from a posterosuperior retraction (perforation). From 1964 to 1980, one-stage operations were carried out on 271 ears with sinus cholesteatomas. Follow-up included 90% of the patients, and the median observation time was 9.75 years. The recurrence rate was 10%. The recurrence rate was found to be independent of the mastoidectomy type employed. The best hearing results were obtained in ears with intact ossicular chain. We conclude that, wherever possible, sinus cholesteatoma should be removed through the auditory canal without mastoidectomy just as an intact ossicular chain should be preserved. "Canal wall up" and "canal wall down" appear to be equally valuable mastoidectomy types, and both methods must be employed to obtain optimum results.

T1  - [Tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using hydroxyapatite granules for aural cholesteatoma--a clinical and experimental study]
AB  - Hydroxyapatite granules were employed for mastoid obliteration in cases of aural cholesteatoma. After eradicating a cholesteatoma by the canal-down technique, the canal wall was reconstructed with cortical bone chips, and the mastoid cavity was obliterated with hydroxyapatite granules. Tympanoplasty by this technique was performed on 48 ears with aural cholesteatoma. There was no recurrence of cholesteatoma during the follow-up period of two years after surgery. One case of residual cholesteatoma was found in the mesotympanum. There were two cases in which the hydroxyapatite granules became exposed through the posterior canal skin. An air-bone gap of less than 20 dB was achieved in 73% of all the patients. Experimental studies in guinea pigs have demonstrated that hydroxyapatite granules do not undergo morphological changes in and are tightly interdigitated with newly formed bone tissue growing from bulla bone one year after hydroxyapatite implantation in the temporal bullae. The newly-formed bone showed incomplete osteon structures. Excellent biocompatibility and bone adaptability of hydroxyapatite granules were demonstrated experimentally. It is concluded that tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using hydroxyapatite is safe and useful for avoiding mastoid cavity problems and for preventing the recurrence of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Predictors of residual-recurrent cholesteatoma in children
AB  - The aggressive nature of childhood cholesteatoma has generated much controversy regarding the optimal management of this challenging disorder. To identify potential predictors of residual-recurrent disease, we studied 232 children (244 ears) treated with 427 surgical procedures between 1973 and 1990. Cause of the primary cholesteatoma was congenital in 43 patients (18%), acquired in 83 (36%), and unknown in 106 (46%). Of 90 patients with residual-recurrent disease, 21 (23%) instances were detected during a second-look surgical exploration. The 3- and 5-year residual-recurrence rates were 48% and 57%, respectively. Development of residual-recurrent disease was associated with ossicular erosion (Cox regression) but not with status of the canal wall (up vs down) during tympanomastoidectomy. This study suggests a need for intense and prolonged postoperative follow-up of children with cholesteatoma, especially those with ossicular erosion.

T1  - The Prevention of Recurrent Cholesteatoma in CWU Surgery: The Use of Titanium Sheeting
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the outcomes of a technique of prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma in canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy, using titanium sheeting to repair the external auditory canal wall.PATIENTS: Sixty four cholesteatoma cases were managed during a period from 2007 to 2015. The cases were unselected; the surgery was performed by the senior author. Cholesteatoma Patterns Were: Forty two attic, nine pars tensa, seven combined attic-pars tensa, three congenital, and three other. Primary surgery was undertaken in 33 cases.INTERVENTIONS: All cases underwent CWU surgery that employed canal wall repair using fine titanium sheeting combined with overlying organic material to repair canal wall defects. Drum repairs employed cymba conchae cartilage-perichondrium composite grafts. Chain reconstruction used Spanner struts or Grace Alto PORPs or TORPS.RESULTS: Two cases suffered mesotympanic residual disease, and three, mesotympanic recurrence one of which extended into the attic. Two other cases incurred atticomastoid residues. Transient myringitis occurred in three cases.CONCLUSION: The surgery was judged on its ability to avoid atticomastoid recurrence, and was regarded as highly successful. The titanium sheeting offers a relatively simple but effective technique. The mesotympanic complications are those also commonly found in both CWD and other CWU methods. As in other CWU procedures, the problems of the open cavity were avoided.

T1  - Mastoid Obliteration. Histopathologucal Study of Three Temporal Bones
AB  - Three temporal bones were serially sectioned to study the postoperative fate of the meatally based postauricular musculoperiosteal flap. In all three ears, the flap sealed off the middle ear effectively from the mastoid cavity and in one, with resected canal wall, formed a new soft posterior wall with good meatus. All flaps contained viable muscle, fat, collagen, reticulin, and elastin, and were richly vascularized. In two flaps, small granulating foci of infection were noted. In two temporal bones, from a child with hypogammaglobulinemia, small cholesterol cysts formed behind the falp during the delayed healing of the mastoid wounds.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - The 65 cholesteatomas operated on in children showed a more expansive and rapid growth than those in adults. In one fifth of the cases cholesteatoma filled the whole air-cell area, which was wide in half of the children. Fifty-two ears of these children had an attic or a posterosuperior perforation. One case was complicated by a fistula in the horizontal semicircular canal, and the ossicular chain was unbroken in 23 cases (35%). Thus, the findings support the idea of the primary soft-tissue spread of cholesteatoma in children. Five ears (8%) discharged postoperatively, and three ears (5%) were reoperated on and showed residual tympanal cholesteatoma. Cavity obliteration with canal wall down technique proved safe, even in the cases of the most extensive and active cholesteatoma.

T1  - The use of middle ear endoscopy: has residual cholesteatoma been eliminated?
AB  - Oto-endoscopes allow surgeons to control blind pockets within the middle ear. Many surgeons credit the reduction of residual cholesteatoma in their practice to the use of oto-endoscopes. Since 1988, the author has been using rigid endoscopes in combination with the operating microscope in cholesteatoma surgery. Between 1988 and 1999, 231 primary cholesteatoma operations were performed. The operations included closed cavity mastoidectomy (53 patients), small cavity mastoidectomy (115 patients), open mastoidectomy with primary canal wall reconstruction (44 patients) or mastoid obliteration (19 patients). The median follow-up period was 6.5 years. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma is closed cavity mastoidectomy (9.4 per cent) was found to be similar to that of open cavity mastoidectomy (8.7 per cent). Site analysis of the residual cholesteatoma revealed an incidence of 3.6 per cent in the epitympanum, 10.5 per cent in the sinus tympani and 0.7 per cent in the mastoid bowl. This study showed that residual cholesteatoma has not been eliminated with the use of middle-ear endoscopy, although the incidence has reduced the figures for closed cavity mastoidectomy to single figures.

T1  - Long-term observation after soft posterior meatal wall reconstruction in ears with cholesteatoma
AB  - We performed tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the soft posterior meatal wall for the prevention of post-operative retraction pocket formation. Our method is characterized by the reconstruction of the soft posterior meatal wall, non-obliteration with permanent or temporary materials, including Gelfoam, no use of a Palva flap and the use of fibrin glue for attaching the fascia to the posterior meatal skin. None of the patients experienced post-operative narrow-neck retraction pocket formation, and whenever aeration of the middle ear was disturbed, a balloon-like retraction was observed. Not all the posterior meatal walls retracted. The final position of the posterior meatal wall varied among the subjects. No serious cavity or hearing problems have occurred since surgery. Due to the strong possibility of post-operative retraction pocket formation in cases with a large balloon-like retraction, we rejected adopting the canal wall up technique or hard posterior meatal wall reconstruction.

T1  - Extensive cholesteatoma: long-term results of three surgical techniques
AB  - During the years 1979-81, three different surgical techniques were used in the treatment of 87 ears with extensive cholesteatoma. All procedures were performed in one stage by the same surgeon. Ten to 13 years after the operations about 70 per cent of ears operated on by the canal wall up technique had developed a new cholesteatoma, which in most cases was recurrent, or a deep retraction pocket. A modification of this technique with mastoid obliteration resulted in a similar failure rate. In contrast, ears operated on by the canal wall down technique (in most cases with mastoid obliteration) had acceptable stability with a long-term recurrence rate of about 15 per cent. Most patients in the canal wall down group had a dry ear without significant cavity problems. Hearing in these patients was as least as good as hearing in patients with a preserved canal wall. We conclude that a meticulous one-stage canal wall down technique in ears with extensive cholesteatoma results in a high percentage of unproblematic, stable ears with satisfactory function. In contrast, if the posterior canal wall is preserved, recurrent cholestealoma is the rule more than the exception.

T1  - Tensa retraction cholesteatoma: treatment and long-term results
AB  - To obtain the best possible results of treatment of acquired cholesteatoma, we made a subdivision of cholesteatoma types into attic and pars tensa cholesteatomas, and subdivided the latter further into tensa retraction cholesteatoma and sinus cholesteatomas. Tensa retraction cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the whole pars tensa, whereas sinus cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the postero-superior part of the tensa. We present the long-term results obtained in tensa retraction cholesteatomas treated with one stage surgery from 1964 to 1980. Median observation time was 9 years, range 2 to 19 years. Sixty-one ears were treated without mastoidectomy, whereas 71 ears had canal wall-up mastoidectomy and 64 ears had canal wall-down mastoidectomy. The total recurrence rate was 13.3 per cent; 17 ears had residual cholesteatoma, and nine ears had recurrent cholesteatoma. The best results were obtained in ears with an intact ossicular chain where mastoidectomy was not performed. In 49 per cent of the cases, the cholesteatoma was confined to the tympanic cavity without reaching the aditus, antrum or mastoid process. About one-third to one-quarter of the ears had tympanoplasty only, with removal of the cholesteatoma through the ear canal.

T1  - Canal wall down techniques for managing cholesteatoma
AB  - Cholesteatoma remains a common otological problem. This series shows that a simple open cavity technique, with meatoplasty, remains a cost-effective option for treatment. Most ears are rendered dry and safe, with cavity problems minimized by careful technique. Subsequent outpatient care is required infrequently and is well tolerated. The hearing is no worse after the operation than before and some ears are suitable for subsequent tympanoplasty.

T1  - Can MRI replace a second look operation in cholesteatoma surgery?
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the petrous bones could replace the conventional second look surgical procedure when a canal wall up tympanoplasty procedure has been performed during the first look surgery. Eighteen patients were examined with MRI prior to a second look surgical procedure. MRI was performed on a 1.5 T superconducting system. T2 weighted images before contrast and T1 weighted images after contrast (gadopentate dimeglumine) were obtained. Imaging results were compared with surgical findings. The poor radiosurgical correlation (50% and 61% after re-evaluation) suggests that, at the present time, MRI is not a valid alternative to a second look surgical intervention in the case of cholesteatoma treated by canal wall up tympanoplasty. In our study, MRI was not capable of differentiating small pearls of residual cholesteatoma from surrounding scar tissue.

T1  - Effects of mastoid cavity obliteration on the growth of experimentally produced residual cholesteatoma
AB  - The effects of obliteration of the mastoid cavity on the growth of residual cholesteatoma were histologically studied in an animal model. A dermal cyst was produced by grafting a piece of autologous auricular skin in the otic bulla of 11 guinea-pigs. Three weeks after grafting, part of the cyst wall facing the cavity was removed and the debris accumulated inside was inserted into the surrounding granulation using a micropick. This procedure simulates the growth mechanism of cholesteatoma residue which sometimes occurs after middle ear surgery in human subjects. In six animals, the bulla was then obliterated with plaster of Paris. The remaining five animals were used as controls. Animals were killed for histological study at 2, 4 or 8 weeks postoperatively. Microscopic examinations revealed that in the obliteration group, severe inflammatory reactions were induced in the otic bulla, although the graft epithelium survived there; dermal cyst reformed in only one of six animals. In the controls, cyst reformation was recognized in all animals. This indicated that severe inflammation induced by plaster prevented growth of the graft epithelium in the otic bulla.

T1  - Surgical treatment of chronic middle ear disease. II. Canal wall up and canal wall down procedures
AB  - Results of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoid one-stage surgery were evaluated in 268 ears. In the CWU group of 121 ears, 50 ears (41%) had clinical cholesteatoma, whereas cholesteatoma was present in all 147 ears operated upon by the CWD technique. The disease was much less severe in the former group, which, for instance, showed no labyrith fistula, as compared with 17 (12%) in the latter group. Extensive disease also accounts for the larger number of complications seen in the CWD group. Average hearing levels postoperatively in the CWU group were significantly better than preoperatively. In the CWD group the preoperative levels were maintained. Recurrence of cholesteatoma was noted in 2% in the CWD group, while one implantation cholesteatoma occurred in the CWU group. Of the many surgical procedures available, the one offering the best means of curing the disease should of course be chosen. Ossicular repair with bone offers good prospects of a successful one-stage reconstruction.

T1  - Surgical treatment of chronic middle ear disease. III. Revisions after tympanomastoid surgery
AB  - Revision surgery was performed in 185 ears which had earlier undergone a total of 276 tympanomastoid operations. An open cavity had been made in 98, obliteration in 44 and canal wall up surgery in 43 ears. All ears were now operated upon by the open method combined with ear canal reconstruction and mastoid obliteration. Mastoid cholesteatoma was found in 50% of the open cavities and in 63% of intact canal wall ears, while 80% of the obliterated ears showed mastoid retraction pockets with cholesteatoma. Semicircular canal fistulae occurred in all groups, most frequently in open cavities (11%). During the follow-up period after revision (average 5 years) 3% were reoperated upon because of a new cholesteatoma. In the whole series, average hearing levels were slightly better postoperatively and in 34% of the ears the A-B gap was 20 dB at most. The main reason for failure after primary surgery was inadequate mastoid and epitympanic bone work and failure to obliterate the medial parts of the cavity thoroughly.

T1  - Outcomes following ossicular chain reconstruction with composite prostheses: hydroxyapatite-polyethylene vs. hydroxyapatite-titanium
AB  - We conducted a retrospective study to compare the results of ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) with two types of composite prosthesis: a hydroxyapatite-polyethylene (HAPEX) implant and a hydroxyapatite-titanium (HATi) prosthesis. We reviewed the records of 222 patients-104 males and 118 females, aged 8 to 79 years (mean: 39.7)-who had undergone OCR for ossicular chain dysfunction and who met our eligibility criteria. In addition to demographic data and the type of prosthesis, we compiled information on pre- and postoperative audiometric findings, the underlying diagnosis, the timing of surgery (primary, planned, or revision), the type of surgery (tympanoplasty alone, tympanoplasty with antrotomy, intact-canal-wall tympanomastoidectomy, or canal-wall-down tympanomastoidectomy), the extent of reconstruction (partial or total), the use of the malleus, the use of a tragal cartilage graft, and evidence of extrusion. Of the 222 patients, 46 had undergone insertion of either a partial (n = 36) or total (n = 10) ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP and TORP, respectively) made with HAPEX, and 176 had received a PORP (n = 101) or TORP (n = 75) made with HATi. Postoperatively, the mean air-bone gap (ABG) was 14.0 dB in the HAPEX group and 14.7 dB in the HATi group, which was not a significant difference (p = 0.61). Postoperative success (ABG <=20 dB) with PORP was obtained in 30 of the 36 patients in the HAPEX group (83.3%) and in 87 of the 101 patients in the HATi group (86.1%), while success with TORP was achieved in 7 of 10 HAPEX patients (70.0%) and 56 of 75 HATi patients (74.7%); there was no significant difference in either PORP or TORP success rates between the HAPEX and HATi groups (p = 0.32). A significantly better hearing result was obtained when the malleus was used in reconstruction (p = 0.035), but the use of tragal cartilage led to a significantly worse outcome (p = 0.026). Revision surgery was associated with a significantly worse postoperative result (p = 0.034). Prosthesis extrusion was observed in 9.0% of all cases. The two types of composite assessed in this study yielded similar results in terms of functional hearing and stability, but the HATi prosthesis had some significant advantages. For example, it was associated with more cases in which the ABG closed to less than 10 dB. In addition, because of its thinner stem and lower profile, it can be used in situations that are not possible with the HAPEX implant.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy with otoendoscopy
AB  - A cadaveric study was performed to test the hypothesis that intact-canal-wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) with otoendoscopy allows for equal or better visualization of the middle ear cavity structures when compared with canal-wall-down mastoidectomy (CWDM) with microscopy. Ten temporal bones were prepared with a reversible canal-wall-down tympanomastoidectomy technique. Five anatomic sites in each middle ear cavity (lateral epitympanum, posterior crus of the stapes, the sinus tympani, eustachian tube orifice, and round window niche) were marked with paint. Two otolaryngologists blinded to the purpose of the study viewed the temporal bones with the microscope. Following replacement of the posterior canal walls, the bones were then viewed with a 30degree and a 70degree otoendoscope. All visualized paint marks for each viewing were recorded and compared. We found that ICWM with 30degree or 70degree otoendoscopy provided significantly better visualization of the sinus tympani than did CWDM (p <= 0.001). There was no significant difference among the three methods in visualization of the lateral epitympanum, posterior crus of the stapes, and round window niche. With respect to the eustachian tube orifice, one of the observers reported significantly better visualization with CWDM (p = 0.036). With adjunctive otoendoscopy, it is not necessary to remove the posterior canal wall to adequately visualize or remove disease from various areas of the middle ear cleft. The use of otoendoscopy during cholesteatoma surgery may allow for more frequent preservation of the posterior canal wall and reduced rates of residual cholesteatoma, given the equal or better visualization of the middle ear cavity.

T1  - [Revisional radical mastoidectomy surgeries--25 cases'experience]
AB  - Objective: To analyze the risk factors of failure to dry ear after radical mastoidectomy and discuss key points in revisonal surgery. Methods: Clinical data of 25 patients(32 ears) with revisonal mastoidectomy were analyzed. The preoperative temporal bone CT findings, intra-operative findings, surgical procedures, postoperative operating cavities and aural abilities were recorded and analyzed. Results: All patients received preoperative temporal bone CT followed by revisonal radical mastoidectomy under microscope and general anesthesia. Among the revisonal surgeries, 19 ears(59.4%) presented cholesteatoma and 13 ears(40.6%) had no cholesteatoma. In addition, the inadequate opening for mastoid cavity and incompleted removal of the pathological tissues accounted for 90.6%(29/32), the insufficient drainage of surgical cavity for 90.6%(29/32), the lesions in tympanic ostium of eustachian tube for 31.2%(10/32), the improper operation procedures and selection of incision for 15.6%(5/32). As for the re-operation of the modified canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty(II) plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha were performed in 14 ears(43.8%), the modified canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty(II) plus reconstruction posterior bony wall of ear canal in 2 ears(6.2%); the modified canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty(III) plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha in 10 eras(31.3%), the modified canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty(III) plus reconstruction posterior boney wall of ear canal in 1 ear(3.1%); the radical mastoidectomy plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha in 5 ears(15.6%). Lodoform gauzes were packed in surgical cavity for 2 weeks and the antibiotic was used for 3 days after surgery. All patients had dressing of ears and their ears were dropped with ofloxacin regularly. The dry ear time ranged from 4 to 8 weeks, the average point was the 5th week. During a period of 6-18 months for follow-up, all patients got dried ears. The epithelialization of the operating cavity was well and the tympanic membranes were integrity. There was not pus in surgical cavities. Neither granulation tissue nor cholesteatoma was found to reoccur. Both pure tone air hearing thresholds and air-bone gap decreased in 27 ears after the revisional surgeries, with statistically significant different in comparison to those before the operation (P<0.05). Conclusions: There are many factors leading to the failure of radical mastoidectomy, including not fully opening of the surgical cavity , incomplete removal of the lesion tissue, poor drainage of surgical cavity, the lesions in the tympanic ostium of eustachian tube, and the improper operation procedures. Treatment strategies were taken according to above factors to obtain dry ear in revisional surgeries.

T1  - [The investigation of the strategy of surgical treatment of cholesterol granuloma in the middle ear]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the surgical treatment of cholesterol granuloma in middle ear.METHOD: Nineteen patients of cholesterol granuloma in middle ear were retrospectively study. All the patients were treated with tympanic tube insertion, canal wall up mastoidectomy or intact-tympanic canal wall down mastoidectomy respectively.RESULT: All the cases were followed up from 6 months to 3.3 years. Two patients recurred among the 4 patients treated with tympanic tube insertion, 3 patients recurred among 8 patients treated with canal wall up mastoidectomy, and no recurrence was found among 7 patients treated with intact-tympanic canal wall down mastoidectomy. 12 patients had their hearing improved obviously among 14 patients without recurrence.CONCLUSION: For the juvenile patients with a short medical history occurred for the first time, tympanic tube insertion merely is a rea sonable choice after the factor of obstruction of the pharyngotympanic tube was removed. For the patients with a long medical history and comprehensive lesions, or occurred repeatedly after being treated with tympanic tube in sertion or canal wall up mastoidectomy, the intact-tympanic canal wall down mastoidectomy should be a good choice.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery in pneumatized and non-pneumatized temporal bones
AB  - BACKGROUND: This report compares the different surgical methods for large and pneumatized mastoid cavity (large cavity) and small and poorly pneumatized mastoid cavity (small cavity) cholesteatomas and their results for the facial nerve and mastoid cavity.METHODS: In the period from January 1996 to December 2000, 101 ears with cholesteatomas underwent tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. In the large cavity group, the posterior canal wall was removed and the vertical portion of the facial nerve was skeletonized to lower the facial ridge. Partial obliteration with conchal cartilage and perichondrium at the epitympanum and mastoid tip was used to make the external auditory canal and the mastoid a smooth common cavity without reconstruction of the posterior canal wall. In the small cavity group, the facial ridge was not intentionally lowered as long as the cholesteatoma was completely removed. The whole mastoid cavity was obliterated and the posterior canal wall was reconstructed. The newly reconstructed posterior canal wall was composed of preserved facial ridge in the lower part and obliterated conchal cartilage in the upper part.RESULTS: There were 27 ears with large cavity cholesteatomas and 74 with small cavity cholesteatomas. The incidences of postoperative complications (large cavity versus small cavity) were: facial paralysis, 3 versus 0; minor wound infection, 2 versus 8; flap partial necrosis, 1 versus 4; cartilage partial necrosis, 0 versus 2; external auditory canal stenosis, 0 versus 2; residual drum perforation, 3 versus 3; otitis media with effusion, 3 versus 4; recurrent cholesteatoma, 0 versus 2; and residual cholesteatoma, 1 versus 2.CONCLUSION: Significantly more postoperative facial nerve paralysis in the large cavity group was correlated to skeletonization of the facial nerve and treatment of the facial ridge.

T1  - Risk factors of tympanoplasties in long-term observation
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate risk factors influencing the results of tympanoplasties on the base of material taken from the Department of Otolaryngology and Laryngological Oncology Collegium Medicum of Nicolaus Copernicus University in Bydgoszcz between 2004-2009. In this period 98 operations were done. The time from operation to hearing examination was 3 to 7 years, mean 5,43. Tympanoplastic operation were divided according to Tos classification. Measuring hearing results, tonal audiometry was done and mean air bone gap on four frequencies was assesed (500, 1000, 2000, 3000 Hz), according to AAO-HNS guidelines (1995). This parameter was compared between groups separated according to risk factors, that could potentially affect the results. Those risk factors were: disfunction of the Eustechian tube, localisation and size of the perforation of the tympanic membrane, damage of the ossicles, the state of the mastoid process, the number of operations, the presence of the cholesteatoma or granulating tissue, chronic otitis media in the opposite ear, smoking cigarettes, mastoidectomy, canal wall down technique. The results were analysed using statistical test.RESULTS: The most impotant risk factor affecting treatment&apos;s results (besides discharge from the ear) is damage of the ossicles, especially the malleus and stapes. Well done operation ensures good hearing results irrespectively of the presence of cholesteatoma or granulating tissue, and also in case of reoperation. For all types of tympanoplasties neither the localisation, nor the size of perforation do not influence on hearing results in long term observation.

T1  - Functional and Anatomical Outcome of Inside Out Technique For Cholesteatoma Surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the efficacy of inside-out technique in completely eradicating the cholesteatoma from middle ear and mastoid, preservation of hearing & and quality of life post mastoidectomy with regards to recurrent discharge, wax, granulations.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Non-randomized, prospective, observational study performed at the Department of ENT in our hospital. In the study we included 100 patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma, they underwent inside out mastoidectomy and were followed up till the end of the study to evaluate the efficacy of inside out mastoidectomy in eradicating the disease from the middle ear cleft. To assess preservation of hearing and to assess cavity problems.RESULTS: Of the 100 patients, 98 patients had a total clearance of disease by the inside out approach, and 2 patients, had doubtful clearance. All patients came for regular follow up and none of them had residual disease at the end of the study period. Thus, the overall success rate was 100% in our study. A significant improvement in the mean air conduction (p<0.01) and the mean air bone gap (p<0.01) was seen in all postoperatively at 3rd month PTA. Only one patient had conductive hearing loss one and a half years postoperatively after initial improvement. A dry self-cleansing cavity was achieved in 95% of the patients and only 5% required regular cleaning of wax the cavities.CONCLUSION: Inside out mastoidectomy is a better alternative in canal wall down procedures as it not only clears the disease from the middle ear cleft, but also leaves behind a small postoperative cavity, which will preserve the hearing, decrease the cavity problems and increase the quality of life of such patients.

T1  - Canal wall-down procedure with soft posterior meatal wall reconstruction in acquired cholesteatoma: focus on postoperative middle ear status
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We reviewed surgical results of canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with soft posterior meatal wall reconstruction (SWR) for acquired cholesteatoma (AC), and identified factors associated with surgical outcomes.METHODS: Results from 119 ears with AC (pars flaccida, n = 99; pars tensa, n = 20) that underwent CWDT with SWR were retrospectively reviewed. We defined postoperative balloon-like retraction (PBR) with web formation, which needed reoperation to clean accumulated cerumen, as postoperative deep retraction pocket (PDRP).RESULTS: Residual cholesteatoma was found in 11 ears (9.2%). Seven residual cholesteatomas were treated with outpatient operation. Seven ears (5.9%) showed PDRP. A transcanal approach was applied to all PDRPs. Postoperative mastoid reaeration was observed in 57 ears (47.9%). No factors significantly associated with residual cholesteatoma or PDRP were identified. The frequency of postoperative mastoid reaeration was significantly higher among cases with young age (<50 years), stage I cholesteatoma, or type I ossiculoplasty.CONCLUSION: CWDT with SWR showed low rates of residual cholesteatoma or postoperative deep retraction pocket (PDRP). Most residual cholesteatomas and PDRPs could be dealt with using a minimally invasive procedure. Young age, stage I cholesteatoma, and type I ossiculoplasty were associated with postoperative mastoid reaeration. This procedure seems fully feasible for surgical treatment of AC.

T1  - Challenges and outcomes of cholesteatoma management in children with Down syndrome
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The high incidence of chronic otitis media with effusion and Eustachian tube dysfunction in children with Down syndrome (DS) may predispose them to cholesteatoma formation. Establishing the diagnosis, choosing the appropriate operative intervention, and post-operative care can be challenging.OBJECTIVE: To describe management strategies for cholesteatoma diagnosis, surgical treatment, and post-operative management in children with Down syndrome.METHODS: Retrospective case series of 14 patients (17 total ears) with Down syndrome diagnosed with cholesteatoma over a 9-year period.RESULTS: A total of 14 patients with cholesteatoma (3 with bilateral disease) were analyzed. Thirteen ears (76.5%) had >=2 tympanostomy tubes insertions prior to cholesteatoma diagnosis, and otorrhea and hearing loss were the most common presenting symptoms. Common pre-operative CT scan findings included mastoid sclerosis and ossicular erosion. The average age at first surgery was 9.8 years, and the average follow-up was 4.3 years. For acquired cholesteatoma, most ears were managed with canal wall up (CWU) approaches, but ultimately 6/15 (40.0%) required canal wall down (CWD) approaches. Postoperatively, 3 (20.0%) ears developed new tympanic membrane retraction pockets, but no recurrent cholesteatoma. Four (26.7%) ears developed recurrent disease, and 3 (20.0%) had residual disease at secondary procedures. Ossiculoplasty was performed in 4 ears. Twelve (70.6%) ears were rehabilitated with hearing aids or FM systems.CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of cholesteatoma in Down syndrome was associated with otorrhea, hearing loss, and CT scan findings of ossicular erosion and mastoid sclerosis. Most cases were managed with CWU surgical approaches. Hearing aid use was common post-operatively. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - Different clinical presentation and management of temporal bone fibrous dysplasia in children
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibrous dysplasia is a slowly progressive benign fibro-osseous disorder that involves one or multiple bones with a unilateral distribution in most cases. It is a lesion of unknown etiology, uncertain pathogenesis, and diverse histopathology. Temporal bone involvement is the least frequently reported type, especially in children. We reviewed available articles regarding fibrous dysplasia with temporal bone involvement in children and added four patients aged 7 to 17 years who were diagnosed and treated in our institution from 2006 to 2017. The patients' clinical picture comprised head deformity, external canal stenosis, headache, progressive conductive and/or sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and sudden deafness. Two patients had experienced severe episodic vertigo with nausea and vomiting. Two were referred to us with external canal obstruction and secondary cholesteatoma formation with broad middle ear destruction. One was diagnosed with acute mastoiditis and intracranial complications. Optimal management of fibrous dysplasia is unclear and can be challenging, especially in children. In our two patients with disease expansion and involvement of important structures, surgical treatment was abandoned and a "wait-and-scan" policy was applied. The other two were qualified for surgical treatment. One patient underwent two surgeries: modified lateral petrosectomy (canal left open) with pathological tissue removal, cavity obliteration, and subsequent tympanoplasty. Another patient with extensive destruction of the left temporal bone underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with perisinus abscess drainage and revision 12 months later. Tympanoplasty was unsatisfactory in both patients because of slow progression of the middle ear pathology. None of our patients underwent pharmacological treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In younger patients, observation and a "wait-and-scan" protocol is relevant until significant function, or cosmetic deficits are obvious. Surgery is not preferred and should be delayed until puberty because fibrous dysplasia has a tendency to stabilize after adolescence. In patients with severe symptoms medical treatment can be implemented, but safety of this treatment in children remain controversial.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery with the canal wall up technique combined with mastoid obliteration: results from primary surgery in 230 consecutive cases
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the canal wall up (CWU) technique combined with mastoid obliteration used in cholesteatoma surgery from the aspects of safety and function.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. Information was extracted from a medical database and complementary data from patient files and audiograms were collected and recorded retrospectively.SETTING: A tertiary-stage hospital and a secondary-stage hospital. Surgeons of various levels of experience.METHOD: Data from a consecutive group of 230 primary operations for cholesteatoma surgery using CWU with obliteration employing the combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) technique, from January 1994 to December 2009 were analyzed.RESULTS: In 90% of the ears, the anatomy was normalized with an intact ear drum. The frequency of residual cholesteatoma was 1% and the frequency of recurrent cholesteatoma 8%. Hearing was improved one year postoperatively and remained improved three years postoperatively. No patient suffered a total hearing loss.CONCLUSIONS: CWU procedure comprising CAT with obliteration of the mastoid is a safe surgical method with a low frequency of residual and recurrent disease and a good hearing preservation.

T1  - Complete Malleus Removal for Cholesteatoma: A Multivariate Analysis of Ossiculoplasty Success and Residual Disease
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Determine the effect of complete malleus removal during canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma on ossiculoplasty success and rate of residual cholesteatoma.METHODS: We reviewed the operative, audiogram, and clinical reports of patients who underwent canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma between 2009 and 2016 at a tertiary academic medical center with at least 8 months of follow-up after surgery. To control for extent of disease, we independently catalogued the subsites of the middle ear and mastoid that cholesteatoma involved from each operation. We performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the independent effect of complete removal of the malleus on the rate of residual disease and success of ossiculoplasty.RESULTS: One hundred eighty surgeries were included in the analysis. For ossiculoplasty success, the adjusted odds ratio of complete malleus removal was 1.7 (95% CI, 0.43-7.0, P = .43), which was not statistically significant. For residual disease, the adjusted odds ratio of complete malleus removal versus not was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.074-1.1, P = .076), which approached but did not meet statistical significance.CONCLUSION: Though complete malleus removal does not independently decrease the rate of residual cholesteatoma, it may be a safe technique as it did not compromise ossiculoplasty success.

T1  - Direct cost comparison of totally endoscopic versus open ear surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Totally endoscopic ear surgery is a relatively new method for managing chronic ear disease. This study aimed to test the null hypothesis that open and endoscopic approaches have similar direct costs for the management of attic cholesteatoma, from an Australian private hospital setting.METHODS: A retrospective direct cost comparison of totally endoscopic ear surgery and traditional canal wall up mastoidectomy for the management of attic cholesteatoma in a private tertiary setting was undertaken. Indirect and future costs were excluded. A direct cost comparison of anaesthetic setup and resources, operative setup and resources, and surgical time was performed between the two techniques.RESULTS: Totally endoscopic ear surgery has a mean direct cost reduction of AUD$2978.89 per operation from the hospital perspective, when compared to canal wall up mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: Totally endoscopic ear surgery is more cost-effective, from an Australian private hospital perspective, than canal wall up mastoidectomy for attic cholesteatoma.

T1  - Improved autologous cortical bone harvest and viability with 2Flute otologic burs
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine if 2Flute (Stryker Corporation, Kalamazoo, MI) otologic burs improve the size, cellular content, and bone healing of autologous cortical bone grafts harvested during canal wall reconstruction (CWR) tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration.STUDY DESIGN: Institutional review board-approved prospective cohort study.METHODS: Human autologous cortical bone chips were harvested using various burs (4 and 6 mm diameter; multiflute, and 2Flute [Stryker Corporation]) from patients undergoing CWR tympanomastoidectomy for the treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Bone chip size, cell counts, cellular gene expression, and new bone formation were quantified.RESULTS: Bone chips were significantly larger when harvested with 2Flute (Stryker Corporation) bur compared to multiflute burs at both 6 mm diameter (113 +/- 14 mum2 vs. 66 +/- 8 mum2 ; P < 0.05) and 4 mm diameter (70 +/- 8 mum2 vs. 50 +/- 3 mum2 ; P < 0.05). After 2 weeks in culture, cell numbers were significantly higher when harvested with 2Flute (Stryker Corporation) bur compared to multiflute burs at both 6 mm diameter (48.7 +/- 3 vs. 31.8 +/- 3 cells/mug bone; P < 0.05) and 4 mm diameter (27.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 8.8 +/- 1.2 cells/mug bone; P < 0.05). Bone-derived cells express osteoblast markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin). Cultured cells are able to form new bone in culture, and bone formation is facilitated by the presence of bone chips.CONCLUSION: Use of 2Flute (Stryker Corporation) otologic burs for human autologous cortical bone harvest results in more viable bone fragments, with larger bone chips and more osteoblasts. Future studies are needed to determine if this leads to improved bone healing.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA. Laryngoscope, 128:E41-E46, 2018.

T1  - Residual cholesteatoma revealed by endoscopy after microsurgery
AB  - Residual cholesteatoma revealed by endoscopy after microsurgery.OBJECTIVE: To endoscopically examine common sites of residual cholesteatoma occurrence after microscopic ear surgery.METHODS: Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women; age range: 7-81 years) who underwent treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma (20 patients with pars flaccida :holesteatoma and 10 patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma) were selected. Following the removal of the cholesteatoma matrix via microscopy, residual matrix presence was assessed using an endoscope system. Additional resection was performed if the residual matrix was detected. Sites of residual matrix and their rates of incidence were then investigated.RESULTS: Residual matrix was observed in nine out of the 30 (30%) patients by endoscopy after microscopic surgery. Residual matrix was observed in eight out of the 20 (40%) patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma and in one out of :he 10 (10%) patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma. Residual matrix was observed in six out of the 14 (43%) patients who underwent canal wall up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy and in three out of the 13 (23%) patients who underwent -anal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy. Sites of residual matrix included the tegmen tympani in two patients, he medial scutal surface in three patients, the tympanic sinus in two patients and the anterior epitympanic recess in three patients. The risk of residual matrix was greater in patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma than in those with pars tensa :holesteatoma. The attic, tympanic sinus and anterior epitympanic recess are common sites of residual cholesteatoma.CONCLUSION: Endoscopy is advantageous for the assessment of residual cholesteatoma in hidden areas.

T1  - Bioactive glass obliteration of the mastoid significantly improves surgical outcome in non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media patients
AB  - This retrospective follow-up study evaluates the efficacy and safety of bioactive glass (BAG) S53P4 when applied as filler material in mastoid obliteration surgery performed on non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media (NC-COM) patients with chronically discharging ears despite conservative therapy. 94 Patients (96 ears) were included. Patients underwent either intact canal wall (ICW) or canal wall down (CWD) mastoid surgery between 2005 and 2015. The intervention group comprised 23 patients (23 ears) who were treated with additional mastoid obliteration using BAG S53P4; the remaining 71 patients (73 ears) were considered controls. All patients underwent preoperative CT scanning of the mastoid. Primary functional outcome, as defined by control of suppuration, was assessed using Merchant's scale. Hearing results as measured by air-bone gap and the incidence of adverse events were assessed as secondary outcomes. Thirty-two ears (44%) in the control group (n = 73) achieved complete control of infection at the most recent postoperative clinic visit vs 17 (74%) in the S53P4 obliteration group (n = 23). Comparing these outcomes yielded an odds ratio (OR) of 3.6 (p = 0.012, 95% CI 1.3-10.3). Complete failure to manage infection significantly differed (p = 0.048) between the control group (11 ears; 15%) and the S53P4 obliteration group (0 ears). No adverse events were observed in either group. Pre- and postoperative ABG results did not differ significantly between groups. Obliteration of the mastoid cavity using BAG S53P4 along with mastoidectomy in patients with chronically discharging NC-COM significantly improves the achievement of a dry and safe ear as compared to mastoidectomy alone. Importantly, no adverse events were observed with S53P4 BAG obliteration.

T1  - Risk Factors of Recurrence in Pediatric Congenital Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the risk factors of recurrence in pediatric congenital cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.SETTING: University hospital.PATIENTS: Sixty-seven patients having tympanic type of congenital cholesteatoma under 15-years old at surgery.INTERVENTIONS: Canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (n = 30) or transcanal atticotomy/tympanoplasty (n = 37) was performed depending on cholesteatoma extension, 16 of which were followed by second-look surgery. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) before second-look surgery or follow-up CT was performed to detect residual recurrence 1 year after the surgery. Cholesteatoma found at the second surgery was also included in the recurrence. All patients had no recurrent cholesteatoma at the last follow-up (median, 61 mo after surgery).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Possible predictive factors were compared between the groups.RESULTS: Residual cholesteatoma and retraction cholesteatoma occurred in 21 and 6%, respectively. There was no significant difference in age, sex, and type of cholesteatoma (open or closed) between the groups; however, Potsic stage and status of stapes involvement were more advanced in the residual cholesteatoma group. All residual lesions could be detected by follow-up CT or by second-look surgery. All of four retraction cholesteatoma patients were male, young at the surgery and in stage IV.CONCLUSION: Recurrence mostly occurred as residual cholesteatoma, suggesting that CT is recommended as a follow-up tool for congenital cholesteatoma. Advanced lesions had the risk of residual cholesteatoma, suggesting that complete removal of epithelium is important. Although rare, young advanced-stage patients had risk of retraction cholesteatoma and therefore normal mucosa should be preserved as much as possible for these patients.

T1  - Bilateral congenital cholesteatoma: Surgical treatment and considerations
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe a multicenter study regarding surgical management of bilateral congenital cholesteatoma (BCC) and underline the importance of endoscopes in the management of this condition. In BCC, hearing preservation is more crucial than in unilateral cases. The endoscopic approach allows complete removal of cholesteatoma via a minimally invasive technique offering low residual disease rates while preserving the normal physiology of the middle ear and possibly the ossicular chain.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart and surgical video review of patients with BCC who underwent surgery at Otolaryngology Department of Modena and Verona University Hospitals and the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto.METHODS: From 2002 to November 2016, six patients were identified with bilateral congenital cholesteatoma and included in this study. Pre-operative assessments, surgical treatments and outcomes were collected and described.RESULTS: The median age at presentation was 4 years (range 2-7 years). A microscopic post auricular tympanoplasty was performed in two ears, four underwent a canal wall up mastoidectomy procedure and in the other six a transcanal endoscopic approach (TEA) was used. No intra- or post-operative complications were observed in any patients. The mean follow up period was 54.5 months.CONCLUSIONS: When both ears are involved with congenital cholesteatoma, it is particularly important to use a minimally invasive technique that preserves normal ossicular and mastoid structure and function whenever possible. In many cases this can be achieved with TEA, even in young children. In addition the endoscope allows good surgical control of cholesteatoma removal from hidden recesses.

T1  - [Clinical characteristics in children with cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma]
AB  - Objective: To summarize the characteristics of children diagnosed as cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma. Methods: There were five middle ear cholesteatoma cases who had previously received cleft palate repairment surgery. All of the patients were followed up for 17 to 47 months. Median follow-up time was 31 months. Results: There were three males and two females with three to eleven years old , and the average of age was seven years and ten months. The time of cleft palate repairment surgery was from six months to four years, and the average age was one year and nine months. No history of grommet insertion. Three cases were unilateral choleateatoma (right ear in two cases and left ear in one case, of which two cases of contralateral ear with secretory otitis media) and two cases were bilateral choleateatoma. Five cases(seven ears) received surgeries. Radical mastoidectomy + canal wall down tympanoplasty were performed in three ears, in which we found stapes disappeared. Radical mastoidectomy + canal wall up tympanoplasty were performed in four ears, in which we found intact foot plate, with recurrence occurred in one case nine months after the first surgery. No recurrence occurred after the second canal wall down tympanoplasty. The postoperative average hearing thresholds of air conduction were improved in different degrees. Conclusions: There may be a relationship between cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma and no grommet insertion history. The incidence of bilateral cases is relatively high, and otitis media with effusion may occur because of poor Eustachian tube function in the unilateral cases. Choice of surgical methods should be decided basing on combination of decreasing the recrudescence and improving the hearing.

T1  - Significance of intraoperative findings in revision tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - PURPOSE: The study was designed to assess correlations between intraoperative findings in revision tympanomastoidectomy as predictors of cholesteatoma recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-institution cohort of 101 patients who underwent surgical treatment for recurrent chronic otitis media in a tertiary referral otology centre.RESULTS: Out of 101 patients, 65 had canal wall up and 36 canal wall down revision surgery. There were 35 cholesteatoma recurrences. Sites most commonly associated with recurrent disease were residual facial ridge cells in 46 (45.5%), ossicular chain sites in 46 (45.5%) patients, posterior external auditory canal wall erosions in 38 (37.6%) patients and mastoid apex recurrence in 35 (34.7%) patients. Ossicular and posterior external auditory canal wall erosion and incomplete removal of mastoid apex cells correlate well with cholesteatoma recurrence accompanied by canal wall up surgery (p=0.009). Residual mastoid apex cells, posterior external auditory canal wall erosion and presence of residual facial ridge cells were identified as the strongest positive predictors of cholesteatoma recurrence, identifying high risk patients associated with canal wall down procedures (p=0.0036).CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between intraoperative findings and cholesteatoma recurrence could improve preoperative and intraoperative planning and reduce the rates of postoperative failures1 due to mismanagement of high risk areas.

T1  - Impact of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media in Pediatric Cochlear Implant Recipients-Insight into the Challenges from a Tertiary Referral Center in UK
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analyze the presentation and evolution of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) in children with cochlear implants (CI) and explore the merit of early intervention.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective patient review.SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital and cochlear implant programme.PATIENTS: Children with a CI who developed CSOM.INTERVENTION: Tympanoplasty.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease control, recurrence of cholesteatoma, cochlear implant preservation.RESULTS: Eight children fit our inclusion criteria with a mean follow up of 8 years. Onset of CSOM symptoms was observed on an average of 5 years after implantation (range, 2-13 yr) and led to surgical intervention in an average of 15.6 months following symptom onset. Cholesteatoma was found in four of the eight patients. Of these, one patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy and explantation with reimplantation at the same stage but the reimplant failed to function and was explanted subsequently. One patient was initially managed by a canal wall up mastoidectomy and explantation but went on to require subtotal petrosectomy and labyrinthectomy for recurrent disease. One patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy with explantation and is awaiting a reimplantation. The fourth patient had limited disease around the electrodes that was excised without compromising the implant. In the group of patients with CSOM without cholesteatoma, one underwent an explantation due to recurrent ear infections and a subsequent cartilage tympanoplasty for a retracted eardrum. The remaining three patients underwent successful excision of retraction pockets and repair of eardrums using cartilage with the implant in situ. A mean follow up of 2 years after the implant preservation surgeries shows good functioning of the CI.CONCLUSION: Early recognition of CSOM is paramount in patients with CI as delay in treatment can result in the infection spreading via the cochleostomy resulting in loss of the cochlea. Recurrent ear infections in an implanted ear should prompt early examination to exclude the presence of middle ear disease, which may require anesthesia in a young child.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration with S53P4 bioactive glass in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - CONCLUSION: Evaluation of the follow-up of 67 patients shows that S53P4 bioactive glass (BAG) granules are safe and effective as obliteration material in cholesteatoma surgery.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and efficacy of mastoid obliteration using S53P4 BAG in cholesteatoma surgery. Clinical outcomes were infection control (Merchant's grading), cholesteatoma recidivism, and audiometric performance.METHODS: Retrospective follow-up study at the Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, the Netherlands. Eighteen young (age <17 years) and 49 adult (age >=17 years) patients treated for cholesteatoma underwent tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration using S53P4 BAG in the period 2012-2015. Outcome was monitored with clinical otoscopy, otorrhea incidence measurement (Merchant's grading), DW-MRI, and audiographic performance analyses (pure tone average and air bone gap).RESULTS: During the follow-up period (mean = 22 months; range = 12-54 months) cholesteatoma recidivism was observed in 6% of the patients (four ears), mostly in young patients (three ears). An acceptably dry ear (Merchant grade 0-1) was achieved in 96% of all cases. The remaining 4% of cases scored a Merchant grade 2. Overall, both air conduction thresholds and air bone gap were slightly lowered when comparing post-operative values to pre-operative values and significantly in the case of ossicular reconstruction. In none of the patients (0%) did post-operative wound infections occur.

T1  - Successful obliteration of troublesome and chronically draining cavities
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the results of revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration using a standardised grading scheme.METHODS: A retrospective study was performed of 121 patients (122 ears) with chronically draining ears who underwent revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration between 2007 and 2013. Surgical indications, patient characteristics, pre- and post-operative Merchant grade, and surgical outcomes were recorded. The main outcome measures were presence of a dry ear, time for complete re-epithelialisation, presence of residual or recurrent disease, and need for revision surgery.RESULTS: In the 5-year follow-up group (n = 31), dry ears were found in 97 per cent after 6 minor revisions and cholesteatoma-free ears were found in 97 per cent. In the total cohort, dry ears were found in 93 per cent after nine revisions and cholesteatoma-free ears were found in 98 per cent. The median time for complete re-epithelialisation was eight weeks. There were no major complications.CONCLUSION: In terms of the dry ear rate, residual cholesteatoma and time to complete epithelialisation, revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration produces very good results in concordance with published results, despite most patients suffering from very troublesome cavities prior to surgery.

T1  - A pearl in the ear: Intracranial complications of pediatric cholesteatomas
AB  - A nine-year-old male had a cholesteatoma of the mastoid and middle ear found incidentally after myringotomy tube placement. Associated asymptomatic sigmoid plate dehiscence with sinus invasion or thrombosis and ossicular chain destruction complicated his case. He had canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy and was followed for 4.5 years. Disease recurrence necessitated revision. Our case highlights an unusual clinical presentation, possible complications, and the aggressive quality of a benign lesion common in the pediatric population. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an asymptomatic lateral sinus obstruction secondary to an invasive cholesteatoma in this population. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - The effects of surgery type and different ossiculoplasty materials on the hearing results in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - To investigate the effects of surgery type [intact canal wall (ICW) or canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy] and different ossiculoplasty materials on hearing outcome in single-staged cholesteatoma surgery. A retrospective case-control study. A total of 116 cases (97 adults, 29 children) underwent surgery, including ossiculoplasty, between 2012 and 2015 for cholesteatoma. Patients who had undergone surgery for the first time, and whose grafts were successful, were included in the study. Patients with adhesive otitis media, unsuccessful grafts, revision and recurrent cases, radical mastoidectomy, and craniofacial anomalies were excluded. Audiogram examinations of the enrolled patients were performed 3-6 months after surgery, and the audiometric results were analyzed according to the criteria of the American Academy of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. All ossiculoplasties were performed during the first operation. The preoperative average air-bone gap (ABG) of the patients was decreased from 31.37 +/- 10.1 to 27.42 +/- 10.4 dB; this decrease was found to be highly significant (p = 0.0001). Concerning the ICW technique, statistical evaluation of the hearing gain at frequencies of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, as well as the mean frequency, showed a high level of significance. Improvement at 4000 Hz was not found to be statistically significant. When the ABGs at 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz, and the mean frequency in patients with an hydroxyapatite-partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (HA-PORP) or autograft-partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (APORP), were evaluated, it was found that, at 4000 Hz, the APORP significantly reduced the ABG (p = 0.02). No significant difference was determined between patients with the hydroxyapatite-total ossicular replacement prosthesis (HA-TORP) and those with the autograft-total ossicular replacement prosthesis (ATORP) (p = 0.565). Although the use of the malleus as an APORP was found to be less effective than other autografts, the degree of advantage of using the incus, malleus, cortical bone, and cartilage did not significantly differ between materials (p = 0.152). Despite the effects of the incus, malleus, and cortical bone not differing in terms of the postoperative ABG (p = 0.160), incus usage was highly beneficial for hearing gain (p = 0.009). Despite CWD tympanoplasty affecting all frequencies, it has a particularly negative effect on the hearing threshold at 1000 Hz. In patients with partial ossicular replacement, autogenous grafts are more successful in restoring hearing at high frequencies, particularly at 4000 Hz. Although autogenous materials do not differ in terms of partial replacement effectiveness, the incus has been shown to be most effective for total replacement.

T1  - Iatrogenic cholesteatoma arising from the vascular strip
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To highlight the phenomenon of cholesteatoma arising from the vascular strip following tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy.STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective chart review.METHODS: Consecutive adult and pediatric patients evaluated between 2000 and 2015 with acquired cholesteatoma arising from the skin of a prior vascular strip were identified. Patients with evidence of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma elsewhere in the middle ear, mastoid, or ear canal were excluded.RESULTS: Seventeen cases (71% female, 53% right-sided) were identified, and the mean age at presentation was 39.2 years. Patients presented on average 12.9 years following prior otologic surgery, which was most commonly tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy (59%). However, younger patients presented with symptoms sooner following prior surgery (r = 0.61, r2 = 0.37, P = 0.0095). The most common presenting symptom was otorrhea (76%). All patients were found to have mastoid cholesteatoma with bony erosion, and three patients exhibited additional tegmen or posterior fossa bone defects. The middle ear was not involved with cholesteatoma in any case. A canal wall down procedure was performed due to extensive bony canal erosion in 29% of cases.CONCLUSION: The vascular strip is an uncommon source of iatrogenic cholesteatoma that can present years following an otherwise uncomplicated otologic surgery. The findings presented herein highlight the importance of careful vascular strip orientation at the conclusion of otologic surgery.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4. Laryngoscope, 127:698-701, 2017.

T1  - Audiological Results of Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis with Cartilage Shoe Technique
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate functional results of total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) shaft stabilization with a cartilage shoe in chronic otitis media patients with cholesteatoma who had undergone canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy (CWDT). In addition, it was determined whether the presence of granular and edematous mucosa in middle ear altered functional outcomes.Methods: Sixty patients, who had undergone CWDT with the use of TORP for the reconstruction of ossicular chain, were divided into two groups. Patients with cartilage shoe were classified as Group 1 (n=30) and those without the shoe were classified as Group 2 (n=30). Patients in both groups were classified into "A" and "B" subgroups according to the middle ear risk index (MERI). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction thresholds were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively.Results: There was no statistically significant change between preoperative AC thresholds of the groups and subgroups (p>0.05). There were statistically significant differences regarding AC thresholds and air-bone gap (ABG) values between Groups 1 and 2 at the postoperative 12th month (p<0.05). Postoperative AC thresholds and ABG values of Group 1B patients with a high MERI score were statistically significant at all frequencies than those of Group 2B patients (p<0.05). When ABG values were compared, it was observed that functional results were better in Group 1B, but a statistically significant difference was observed only at 2000 Hz (p<0.01).Conclusion: The cartilage shoe method for titanium TORP stabilization that is used for ossicular reconstruction during CWDT has been found to have a beneficial effect on auditory outcomes. Cartilage shoe application increases positive effects on hearing outcomes, particularly if the middle ear mucosa is granular and edematous.

T1  - Platelet-Rich Plasma in Reconstruction of Posterior Meatal Wall after Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy
AB  - Introduction Canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy has many drawbacks, including chronic otorrhea not responding to medications, granulations, dizziness on exposure to cold or hot water, and tendency of debris accumulation in the mastoid cavity, demanding periodic cleaning. Many of these problems can be solved by reconstruction of the posterior meatal wall (PMW). Objectives To assess the results of PMW reconstruction after CWD mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma using titanium mesh and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) mixed with bone pate. Methods This study was conducted with 20 patients that have atticoantral chronic suppurative otitis media. All cases were subjected to CWD mastoid surgery with complete elimination of the disease and reconstruction of the PMW by titanium mesh and the mixture of PRP with bone pate. All patients were exposed to a full preoperative evaluation and full postoperative assessment of the complications, the appearance of the external auditory canal contour, and the hearing gain expressed by the change of the air bone gap postoperatively. Results The PMW reconstructed by titanium mesh and the mixture of PRP with bone pate showed a smooth contour. During the follow-up of 12 to 36 months, the postoperative appearance of the external auditory canal contour was found to be smooth without hidden pouches, irregularities or stenosis in all cases. No granulation, foreign body reaction, or extrusion and/or displacement of the titanium mesh were registered. No facial palsy or recurrent cholesteatoma was reported. Conclusion The surgical reconstruction of the PMW using PRP, bone pate and titanium mesh after CWD mastoidectomy appears to be reliable without considerable complications, giving a smooth appearance to the PMW.

T1  - Endoscopic transcanal modified canal-wall-down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - Attic cholesteatoma with antral extension in tight sclerotic mastoid cavities is a common presentation that creates difficult decision-making intraoperatively. Drilling through a sclerotic and small mastoid cavity, keeping the canal wall intactis often difficult and increases the risk of serious injury. Consequently, a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy is often performed. The endoscopic transcanal modified canal-wall-down mastoidectomy approach allows the benefits of an open cavity for cholesteatoma resection and the benefits of a closed cavity for better long-term care and a more normal ear canal and middle ear reconstruction.

T1  - Outpatient management of cholesteatoma with canal wall reconstruction tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - Objectives: The postoperative wound infection rate for canal wall reconstruction (CWR) tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration in the treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma has been reported to be 3.6%. Postoperative administration of 24-48 hours of intravenous antibiotics has been recommended. We aim to determine the infection rate of CWR with postoperative outpatient oral antibiotics.Study Design: Institutional review board-approved retrospective case review.Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent CWR tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration at a single institution from 2014 to 2016. Main Outcome Measure: Patient characteristics (age, sex) were calculated. Rate of postoperative complications and infections within 1 month of surgery were calculated. Comparison to previous published infection rates with postoperative intravenous antibiotics.Results: 51 patients underwent CWR followed by outpatient oral antibiotics with a mean age of 25.9 years (16 patients were less than 10 years old). There were no postoperative wound infections. Outpatient antibiotics showed non-inferiority to IV antibiotic historic controls (0% vs. 3.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0-6.09%; p = 0.03). One patient had small postoperative wound dehiscence with CSF leak that was managed conservatively. One patient developed Clostridium difficile colitis on postoperative day 2.Conclusions: The infection rate after CWR tympanomastoidectomy with use of outpatient antibiotics is low and is non-inferior to a historic cohort treated with inpatient intravenous antibiotics. A larger randomized controlled trial is warranted.Level of Evidence: 4.

T1  - Blind Sac Approach Using Silastic Block for Cochlear Implantation in Patients with Cholesteatoma
AB  - Cochlear implant (CI) surgery in cholesteatoma is challenging because of the risk of residual or recurrent infection. Although CI could be done with subtotal petrosectomy in single or staged surgery, this surgery needed additional surgical procedures to obliterate the mastoid cavity. This paper describes a new surgical technique for CI surgery in cholesteatoma without external auditory canal closure.

T1  - Postoperative Mastoid Aeration Following Canal Wall Up Mastoidectomy according to Preoperative Middle Ear Disease: Analysis of Temporal Bone Computed Tomography Scans
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate postoperative mastoid aeration according to the preoperative middle ear disease and investigate the factors affecting it.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans of temporal bones that were taken 1 year after surgery. The postoperative mastoid aeration was evaluated according to the preoperative diagnosis, and classified into three groups: grade 1 (complete mastoid aeration), an air-filled epitympanum and mastoid cavity; grade 2 (partial mastoid aeration), an air-filled epitympanum and partially aerated mastoid cavity; and grade 3 (absence of mastoid aeration), no air space in the mastoid cavity.RESULTS: The overall mastoid aeration rate was 55.8%, with adhesive otitis media accounting for 21.2%, attic cholesteatoma 53.8%, and chronic otitis media 75.4%. The rates of postoperative mastoid aeration were significantly higher in the chronic otitis media cases and attic cholesteatoma cases than in the adhesive otitis media cases. There were 14 cases requiring revision operations due to the development of a retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. All of the revised cases had grade 3 postoperative mastoid aeration, and underwent canal wall down mastoidectomies.CONCLUSIONS: The degree of postoperative mastoid aeration is associated with the preoperative middle ear disease. When planning a canal wall up mastoidectomy, the surgeon should contemplate the middle ear disease, because a canal wall down mastoidectomy or mastoid obliteration is recommended if the patient has adhesive otitis media.

T1  - Comparative Study of Management of Attico-antral CSOM by Conventional Mastoidectomy with Inside Out Technique
AB  - This prospective study was undertaken to compare the different aspects of inside out and conventional mastoidectomy techniques in attico-antral type of chronic suppurative otitis media. 100 cases of unsafe ear selected in this study were divided in 2 groups-(1) Group A-50 patients operated by conventional technique of canal wall down mastoidectomy. (2) Group B-50 patients operated by inside out technique of canal wall down mastoidectomy. The patients in our series were regularly followed to assess the condition of the postoperative cavity for three months. Post operative results were better by inside out as compared to conventional technique of mastoidectomy. Hearing and air-bone gap improvement was more in patients operated by inside out mastoidectomy. Less number of patients suffered with post operative residual disease like cholesteatoma, granulation, discharge and residual perforation as compared to conventional mastoidectomy.

T1  - Incidence of Facial Nerve Canal Dehiscence in Primary and Revision Cholesteatoma Surgery
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of facial canal dehiscence (FCD) in primary and revision cholesteatoma surgery in a tertiary referral center. Moreover, our second goal was to identify association between FCD and other intra-operative pathological findings in a group of patients with cholesteatoma surgery. Inclusion criteria were primary and revision canal wall up and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy in patients who suffers from chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma. An exclusion criterion was charts with in adequate documentation. In addition tympanoplasty cases were excluded due to evaluate both tympanic and mastoid segments of facial nerve canal. Preoperative clinical data and intra-operative findings were documented in a formatted questionnaire. We found the incidence of FCD in COM surgery was 18%. There was no difference between the primary and revision surgeries regarding its incidence. In addition, there was association between some preoperative or intra-operative findings of COM, such as middle fossa dural dehiscence, external auditory canal polyp, facial nerve paralysis, labyrinthine fistula, and FCD. In conclusions we found that there was no difference between primary and revision surgeries regarding the incidence of FCD. Surgeons should consider effective measures to prevent intra-operative facial nerve trauma in COM surgeries.

T1  - Relation between Ossicular Erosion and Destruction of Facial and Lateral Semicircular Canals in Chronic Otitis Media
AB  - Introduction Chronic otitis media can cause multiple middle ear pathogeneses. The surgeon should be aware of relation between ossicular chain erosion and other destructions because of the possibility of complications. Objective This study aimed to investigate the rates of ossicular erosion in cases of patients with and without facial nerve canal destruction, who had undergone mastoidectomy due to chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Methods We retrospectively analyzed three hundred twenty-seven patients who had undergone tympanomastoidectomy between April 2008 and February 2014. We documented the types of mastoidectomy (canal wall up, canal wall down, and radical mastoidectomy), erosion of the malleus, incus and stapes, and the destruction of facial and lateral semi-circular canal. Results Out of the 327 patients, 147 were women (44.95%) and 180 were men (55.04%) with a mean age 50.8 +/- 13 years (range 8-72 years). 245 of the 327 patients (75.22%) had been operated with the diagnosis of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. FNCD was present in 62 of the 327 patients (18.96%) and 49 of these 62 (79.03%) patients had chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The correlation between the presence of FNCD with LSCC destruction and stapes erosion in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma is statistically significant ( p < 0.05). Conclusion Although incus is the most common of destructed ossicles in chronic otitis media, facial canal destruction is more closely related to stapes erosion.

T1  - Evaluation of Requirements for Staging the Procedure of Reconstruction of Middle Ear After Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy
AB  - Cholesteatoma is a progressive destructive ear disease which can affect any age group. It has been found to be more severe in children and young adults. It erodes the surrounding bone of middle ear, mastoid and ossicles. It causes partial to total deafness, unpleasant smelling discharge, pain, tinnitus, vertigo and facial paralysis. It can even cause meningitis, brain abscess and death. The post-operative outcome of hearing, and the state of the reconstructed middle-ear cavity after concurrent and staged reconstruction of middle ear after canal wall down mastoidectomy was studied in 30 ears with middle-ear cholesteatoma. The reconstructed middle ear was re-aerated in 60.5 % of the cases, which was significantly higher than for the epitympanum (39.5 %). Tympanoplasty was successful in terms of hearing results in 68.9 % of all subjects and in 75.4 % of the ears having a re-aerated tympanic cavity, which was significantly better than the 38.5 % for ears in which the tympanic cavity was not re-aerated. The findings of recurrent cholesteatoma, tympanic atelectasis, and tympanic effusion were observed with significantly (p < 0.03) high incidence in ears with no re-aerated space in their reconstructed mastoid cavities. It was revealed that the post-operative outcome of this surgical technique was significantly related to the state of re-aeration of the reconstructed middle-ear cavity but not with either concurrent or staged reconstruction. Audiological results are same for both concurrent and staged reconstruction following canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy, and hence we reccommend that concurrent reconstruction is preferred in limited disease and staged reconstruction in severe disease.

T1  - Clinical Aspects and Surgical Outcomes of Congenital Cholesteatoma in 93 Children: Increasing Trends of Congenital Cholesteatoma from 1997 through 2012
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The recent increase in the reported incidence of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) may be secondary to the widespread use of otoendoscopy as well as an increased awareness of these lesions among primary care physicians. However, little research about CC has been conducted in a large group of patients. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of CC including the annual number of patients, symptoms, age at diagnosis, stage and type of disease, surgical techniques, recurrence, and postoperative complications.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who met the inclusion criteria between January 1997 and June 2012.RESULTS: Ninety-three patients underwent surgery for CC. The age at operation ranged from 12 months to 17 years (mean age, 6.1 years). The number of patients was less than 4 per year until 2005, but increased to more than 10 per year since 2008. CC was most commonly reported as an incidental finding (58.1%). The operative procedures included the transcanal myringotomy approach (46.2%), canal wall up mastoidectomy (37.6%), tympanoplasty (8.6%), and canal wall down mastoidectomy (7.5%). The recurrence rate was 20.4% and the complication rate was 12.9%. No patients with stage I CC had complications.CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the incidence of CC has recently increased notably. Most patients with stage I and II CC were completely cured by transtympanic surgery, and complication and recurrence rates increased according to the extent of disease. Early detection of CC is important to facilitate minimally invasive surgery and to reduce complication and recurrence rates.

T1  - Intraoperative endoscopy of the anterior epitympanum recess through the posterior tympanotomy
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The anterior epitympanum recess (AER) is a common place of the development of the cholesteatoma, which is why removal of the matrix from this area plays a key role in the surgical treatment of chronic otitis media.AIM: To evaluate the intraoperative visibility of AER in endoscopic optics in comparison to microscopic optics and to determine the prevalence of cholesteatoma in various types of construction of the AER. Study design: retrospective analysis of intraoperative search.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 55 patients treated in the Department of Otolaryngology, Medical University of Warsaw within the years 2009-2011, who underwent endoscopy-assisted canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy. The type of construction of the AER - cellular or dome-shaped - was determined.RESULTS: Cellular type of recess was found intraoperatively in 32% of ears and dome-shaped in 68% of the study group. The population with chronic otitis media does not differ significantly compared to the general population in terms of the construction of the anterior epitympanum recess (p = 0.668108; chi2 = 0.1838235, df = 1). Among the ears with cholesteatoma a cellular AER was found in 48.3% of cases and a dome-shaped AER was found in 51.7%.CONCLUSIONS: The cellular type of AER was significantly more frequent in ears with cholesteatoma (p < 0.01, chi2 = 29.86492, df = 1). Level of evidence: 1b.

T1  - Modified Radical Mastoidectomy with Type III Tympanoplasty: Revisited
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma is a fairly common condition presenting in any ENT clinic and its surgery remains one of the most challenging surgeries in otology. The primary goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to clear the disease and produce a safe and stable ear but there is still debate on whether these goals are best achieved by canal wall down or canal wall up procedures. A retrospective study was done to access benefits of modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) with type III tympanoplasty in terms of eradication of disease and hearing improvement. It consisted of 140 patients of chronic otitis media (attico-antral) who underwent MRM with type III tympanoplasty in 156 ears in a tertiary care centre. Temporalis fascia graft was used for tympanoplasty. Results were analyzed in terms of condition of cavity, condition of graft and gain in hearing. The study showed significant improvement in gain in air conduction (21.24 dB) and closure of AB gap (15.62 dB). In the Indian population with low socio-economic status and poor follow up, single stage canal wall down procedure (MRM) provides maximum benefit to patients in terms of eradication of disease and hearing improvement.

T1  - Mastoid Obliteration with Autologous Bone in Mastoidectomy Canal Wall Down Surgery: a Literature Overview
AB  - Introduction The objectives of mastoidectomy in cholesteatoma are a disease-free and dry ear, the prevention of recurrent disease, and the maintenance of hearing or the possibility to reconstruct an affected hearing mechanism. Canal wall down mastoidectomy has been traditionally used to achieve those goals with greater or lesser degrees of success. However, canal wall down is an aggressive approach, as it involves creating an open cavity and changing the anatomy and physiology of the middle ear and mastoid. A canal wall up technique eliminates the need to destroy the middle ear and mastoid, but is associated with a higher rate of residual cholesteatoma. The obliteration technics arise as an effort to avoid the disadvantages of both techniques. Objective s Evaluate the effectiveness of the mastoid obliteration with autologous bone in mastoidectomy surgery with canal wall down for chronic otitis, with or without cholesteatoma. Data Synthesis We analyzed nine studies of case series comprehending similar surgery techniques on 1017 total cases of operated ears in both adults and children, with at least 12 months follow-up. Conclusion Mastoid Obliteration with autologous bone has been utilized for many years to present date, and it seems to be safe, low-cost, with low recurrence rates - similar to traditional canal wall down procedures and with greater water resistance and quality of life improvements.

T1  - The value of otoendoscopy in the management of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical management of cholesteatoma is a controversial issue, particularly regarding intact-canal-wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) versus canal-wall-down mastoidectomy (CWDM). The current experiment compared the quality of visualization in different middle ear structures using ICWM with otoendoscopy with findings of CWDM by microscopy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The patients diagnosed with cholesteatoma underwent tympanomastoidectomy, and then the patients selected for CWDM were included in the study (25 patients: 11 females and 14 males). After removing the cholesteatoma from the involved areas, otoendoscopic examination was done with a 4 mm, 0degree endoscope by a neurootologist. All five middle ear structures (lateral epitympanum, sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes, round window niche, and Eustachian tube orifice) suspected of occult cholesteatoma were evaluated in terms of having or lacking the pathology. Then, CWDM was performed and all of the mentioned sites were reevaluated for diagnosing occult cholesteatoma.RESULTS: The symmetric measures were 73%, 92%, 63%, 81%, and 100% for lateral epitympanum, sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes, round window niche, and Eustachian tube orifice, respectively.CONCLUSION: Otoendoscopy was confirmed to have a great potential to be adopted by surgeons as a less invasive procedure in the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - Obliteration of Radical Cavities and Total Reconstruction Procedure Without Staging After Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy: Long-term Results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluate the long-term surgical and hearing results using a canal wall down mastoidectomy technique followed by cavities obliteration, canal wall reconstruction and ossiculoplasty without staging.METHODS: A total of 44 patients between January 2002 and October 2009 were selected and 27 of them were revision cases. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone average (PTA) and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed and compared 1 and 4 years after surgery.RESULTS: The middle ear was well healed and aerated in 40 patients (90.9%) and the tympanic membrane was intact in 42 patients (95.5%). Recurrent cholesteatoma was found on postoperative follow-up in two of the revision patients (7.4%) but none in the primary patients. Seven patients were found to have partial canal bone absorption, but revision surgery was not required. Over 86.4% of all cases were water resistant. Long-lasting improvement and/or preservation of hearing, with maintenance of PTA-ABG closure in 63.7% of all cases within 20 dB, were obtained.CONCLUSION: The efficacy of our technique after a canal wall down mastoidectomy is satisfactory, and the rate of complication is acceptably low. We believe that our technique could be a convenient method in disease control and providing an excellent basis for hearing restoration simultaneously.

T1  - Computed Tomography Staging of Middle Ear Cholesteatoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: To establish computed tomography (CT) staging of middle ear cholesteatoma and assess its impact on the selection of the surgical procedure.MATERIAL/METHODS: Prospective study was conducted on 61 consecutive patients (mean age 26.8 years) with middle ear cholesteatoma. CT scan of the temporal bone and surgery were performed in all patients. CT staging classified cholesteatoma according to its location in the tympanic cavity (T); extension into the mastoid (M); and associated complications (C). Cholesteatoma was staged as stage I (T1, T2), stage II (T3, M1, M2, C1), and stage III (C2).RESULTS: The overall sensitivity of CT staging of cholesteatoma compared to surgery was 88% with excellent agreement and correlation between CT findings and intra-operative findings (K=0.863, r=0.86, P=0.001). There was excellent agreement and correlation of CT staging with surgical findings for T location (K=0.811, r=0.89, P=0.001), good for M extension (K=0.734, r=0.88, P=0.001), and excellent for associated C complications (K=1.00, r=1.0, P=0.001). Atticotympanotomy was carried out in stage I (n=14), intact canal wall surgery was performed in stage II (n=38), and canal wall down surgery was done in stage III (n=5) and stage II (n=4).CONCLUSIONS: We established CT staging of middle ear cholesteatoma that helps surgeons to select an appropriate surgery.

T1  - Atticotomy, Attic Reconstruction, Tympanoplasty with or Without Ossiculoplasty, Canal Plasty and Cortical Mastoidectomy as Part of Intact Canal Wall Technique for Attic Cholesteatoma
AB  - To evaluate a technique of canal wall up mastoidectomy for limited attic cholesteatoma and to study practical considerations during surgery. Any person undergoing surgery for attic cholesteatoma was thoroughly examined during surgery and decision for doing this canal wall up (CWU) surgery will be taken on operating table. The patients were regularly followed up and microscopic, oto endoscopic and audiological assessments done at regular intervals. Revision surgery was done only if there were signs of recidivism or if ossiculoplasty was planned for second stage or placement of a prosthesis later was considered. Out of 100 cholesteatoma surgeries, 22 cases found suitable for the CWU technique. Only 1 out of 22 patients required revision surgery due to recurrence. Rest of the patients maintained healthy middle ear for more than a year. Prevention of medialisation of attic cartilage piece was found to be very important consideration. The CWU technique is a reliable method of management for limited attic cholesteatoma. Selection of subjects should be very meticulous.

T1  - Mastoid cavity obliteration with combined palva flapand bone pate
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was designed to evaluate the usefulness of mastoid cavity obliteration with combined bone pate and Palva flap in the prevention of problematic mastoid cavities after canal wall down mastoidectomy.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study with a mean follow-up of 28 months conducted between 2008-2012, a series of 56 ears in 48 patients with chronic otitis media due to a cholesteatoma underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy that their mastoid cavity obliterated with combined bone pate and Palva flap. Seventeen (30%) ears were managed via revision surgery, with the reminder via primary surgery. Data included mastoid cavity status, results at second-look surgery with ossiculoplasty, and postoperative complications.RESULTS: All patients underwent second-look surgery. Forty-six (82%) ears maintained a very small, dry and healthy mastoid cavity. Seven (13%) ears had occasional otorrhea, and three (5%) ears had small granulation tissue. Seven (12.5%) ears had residual cholesteatoma pearl in the middle ear at second-look surgery. Four (7%) ears exhibited wound infection.CONCLUSION: Canal wall down mastoidectomy and mastoid cavity obliteration with combined bone pate and Palva flap is a effective option for the complete removal of cholesteatoma and prevention of postoperative mastoid cavity problems.

T1  - Hearing benefit in allograft tympanoplasty using tutoplast processed malleus
AB  - Objectives . Tutoplast processed human cadaveric ossicular allografts are a safe alternative for ossicular reconstruction where there is insufficient material suitable for autograft ossiculoplasty. We present a series of 7 consecutive cases showing excellent air-bone gap closure following canal-wall-down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma and reconstruction of the middle ear using Tutoplast processed malleus. Patients and Methods . Tympanoplasty with Tutoplast processed malleus was performed in seven patients to reconstruct the middle ear following canal-wall-down mastoidectomy in a tertiary ENT centre. Main Outcome Measures. Hearing improvement and recurrence-free period were assessed. Pre-and postoperative audiograms were performed. Results . The average pre operative hearing loss was 50 +/- 13 dB, with an air-bone gap of 33 +/- 7 dB. Post operative audiograms at 25 months demonstrated hearing thresholds of 29 +/- 10 dB, with an air-bone gap of 14 +/- 6 dB. No prosthesis extrusion was observed, which compares favourably to other commercially available prostheses. Conclusions . Tutoplast processed allografts restore conductive hearing loss in patients undergoing mastoidectomy and provide an excellent alternative when there is insufficient material suitable for autograft ossiculoplasty.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Comparison between canal wall-down and canal wall-up techniques in surgery for chronic otitis media
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic otitis media (COM) is an inflammatory condition associated with otorrhea as well as large and persistent perforations of the tympanic membrane in some cases. COM can also lead to cholesteatoma. Surgical treatment with canal wall-down and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is considered for both types of illness. The choice of technique is controversial and is dependent on several factors, including the extent of disease.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes in COM patients with and without cholesteatoma treated with canal wall-down and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Disease eradication and post-operative auditory thresholds were assessed.METHOD: Patient records from the otorhinolaryngology department of a tertiary hospital were assessed retrospectively.RESULTS: Patients who underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy had a higher rate of revision surgery, especially those with cholesteatoma. However, there were no statistically significant differences in post-operative hearing thresholds between the two techniques.CONCLUSION: The canal wall-down technique is superior to the canal wall-up technique, especially for patients with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Does endoscopic surgery reduce recurrence of the petrous apex cholesteatoma?
AB  - The aim of this study is to present the clinical symptoms, complications and treatments of the petrous apex cholesteatoma and is to describe the current role of oto-endoscopy. This was a retrospective non-randomized study of 14 petrous apex cholesteatoma surgeries performed between 1994 and 2012. Petrosectomy was performed according to the location of the cholesteatoma, hearing level of the patients and facial nerve function. Oto-endoscopy was used in the petrous apex and the cerebellopontine angle for residual cholesteatoma. 14 patients, seven were men and seven women were included in this study between 1994-2012. The most common symptom was hearing loss (85.7 %) and tinnitus (50 %) at the presentation. During the surgeries, it was observed that cholesteatoma involved most frequently facial nerve, dura and labyrinthines. Labyrinthectomy, middle cranial fossa approach and petromastoidectomy was performed to these patients. Four of six patients operated without the endoscope assistance between 1994-2006 had recurrences after the operation. These patients were re-operated and in the follow up, there was no recurrence. In the endoscopy assisted surgery, there was no recurrence observed (significance level p = 0.014). The most common complication after the surgery was hearing loss (42.8 %) but it was not significant after surgery (p > 0.05). The petrous apex and mastoid cavity was obliterated with fat tissue in eight patients while six patients were exteriorized to follow the recurrence and it was insignificant in recurrences (p > 0.05) CONCLUSION: Endoscope-assisted surgery allows to remove residual the cholesteatoma around the carotid artery, dura and facial nerve in the petrous apex resulting in less invasive surgery and less recurrence in blind spots.

T1  - Aggressiveness of pediatric cholesteatoma. Do we have an evidence?
AB  - To compare pediatric and adult patients, affected by cholesteatoma for the clinical presentation, disease extent and final outcome. This is a prospective study in which 60 cases of unsafe chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma were included. These cases were divided into two groups of 30 cases each on the basis of age. All patients were subjected to detailed clinical examination. A high resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone was done in all the cases. An innovative grading system was devised to grade the disease. The patients were subjected to canal wall down mastoidectomy and were evaluated postoperatively for resolution of the symptoms, hearing and cavity problems. Granulation tissue along with cholesteatoma was more common among children (p < 0.01), whereas cholesteatoma alone was more common among adults. There was excellent correlation between the radiological and surgical findings. It was seen that higher the grade of the disease, the greater was the risk of complications and recidivism (p < 0.05). Recidivism was significantly higher in children (p < 0.05) whereas complications were equally common in both the groups. Hearing improvement was equivocal in both groups. Presence of granulation tissue along with cholesteatoma in children causes more aggressive disease with higher recidivism rate.

T1  - Topical application of mitomycin C in the treatment of granulation tissue after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Otorrhea and granulation tissue in Canal Wall Down mastoidectomy (CWD) is the common problem in cholesteatoma removal and leads to many discomfort for both the patient and the physician. The main objective in CWD is creating the dry cavity, so the topical antibiotic and acetic acid in variable saturations are used for this purpose. In this study we evaluate the effectiveness of topical MMC and chemical cautery by acetic acid.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study population consists of 50 patients with cholesteatoma whom underwent CWD. All patient allocated randomly in two study groups, MMC and acetic acid. After 3 weeks, the first visit is planned, extension of granulation tissue and dryness of cavity are evaluated and topical drugs are used in blind fashion. MMC in 4% and acetic acid in 12.5% saturation are applied. Other visits are completed at next month and 3 months later.RESULTS: Both methods are effective in treatment of granulation tissue. In each group both treatment were effective too but MMC was more effective than acid acetic in the treatment of granulation tissue after 4 weeks.CONCLUSION: Based on our findings, it is clear that topical MMC is very effective in the treatment of granulation tissue and in CWD. It results in dry cavity much better than acetic acid without any complication.

T1  - Clinical Significance of beta-Tricalcium Phosphate and Polyphosphate for Mastoid Cavity Obliteration during Middle Ear Surgery: Human and Animal Study
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mastoid obliteration is used to obliterate the mastoid cavity following a mastoidectomy or to prevent the formation of a retraction pocket. This study evaluated the effectiveness of beta-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate (beta-TPP) for mastoid obliteration in middle ear surgeries in prospective human and animal studies.METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic otitis media underwent mastoid obliteration using beta-TPP after a intact canal wall mastoidectomy or simple mastoidectomy. The clinical data were prospectively evaluated including: the diagnosis, temporal bone computed tomography (TBCT), otoscopic findings, pure tone audiogram, and complications. In the animal experiment, beta-TPP was applied into the right bulla in five rats, and the opposite bulla was used as the control in the non-obliterated state. The skulls of five other rats were drilled out and the holes were obliterated with beta-TPP. TBCT were obtained at 3, 6, and 9 months after the obliteration and histologic analysis was done at 3 and 9 months after surgery.RESULTS: In the human study, fourteen TBCTs were obtained at 12 months after the surgery. All demonstrated no bone resorption in the obliterated mastoids. Among the 15 cases displaying retracted tympanic membranes preoperatively, 11 showed no retraction, 2 showed retraction postoperatively, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 was a case of postoperative wound infection. Among 20 cases, one case developed a postoperative infection that necessitated a second operation. Sixteen underwent ossiculoplasty; hearing improvements were obtained in 15 cases and 1 case showed decreased hearing. In the animal study, new bone formation without significant bone resorption in the radiologic and histologic findings were noted in both the skull and bulla groups.CONCLUSION: Although beta-TPP is a foreign material having the possibility of infection, mastoid obliteration with it can be a treatment option in middle ear surgeries to prevent retraction pockets or the recurrence of diseases.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration with silicone blocks after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the usefulness of silicone blocks as graft material for mastoid cavity obliteration in the prevention of problematic mastoid cavities after canal wall down mastoidectomies.METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 20 patients who underwent mastoid obliteration with silicone blocks between 2002 and 2009 at the Chonnam National University Hospital. The cases consisted of 17 patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and 3 patients with adhesive otitis media. The postoperative follow-up period was an average 49 months (range, 6 to 90 months). The surgical technique used at our institution composed four major steps: First, the canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed and the middle ear procedure was completed. The silicone blocks were used to fill up the mastoidectomized cavity. Then, a cortical bone pate was used to cover the surface of the silicone blocks. Finally, temporalis fascia and a split musculoperiosteal flap were used to surround the bone pate for reinforcement of the reconstructed canal wall. We examined postoperative success rate and hearing outcomes.RESULTS: In 19 cases (95%), the reconstructed canal wall maintained a cylindrical shape and the ear drum healed without perforation. In only 1 case (5%), the reconstructed canal wall was destroyed with ear drum perforation. The mean improvement in air-bone gap was about 12 dB (P<0.05), and the mean improvement in air-conduction was about 16 dB (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: We suggest that silicone blocks could be valuable resources as graft materials for mastoid obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomies.

T1  - Retrospective and prospective study of singapore swing method on healing of mastoid cavity
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma is a common problem. The majority of ENT surgeons find the canal wall down operation to be the safest and simplest means of treating cholesteatoma. The 'Singapore Swing' is a method of promoting healing of mastoid cavity. In this study our main objective was to do Singapore Swing technique in larger number of cases, have long term follow-up and to compare its results with other mastoid operations in which obliteration has not been used. Patients of cholesteatoma were divided into case group and control group. The case group (26 patients) was operated by canal wall down procedure with Singapore Swing obliteration while the control group (62 patients) was operated by same method without any obliteration. Both retrospective and prospective studies were done. Time period of drying of mastoid cavity, numbers of visits to the hospital and hearing status were observed. Subjective satisfaction score of patient (0-10) and Surgeon's satisfaction score (fully satisfied, partially satisfied and not satisfied at all) were measured in both the groups. The time of drying of cavity was <2 months in 88.5% of cases, while 27.5% of controls. Mean time of drying of cavity was 46 days (11/2 months) in case group, while it was 89 days (3 months) in control group. Gain in air conduction was 11-30 dB in 33.3% cases and 15.7% of controls. 2 patients in control group had deterioration of 1-10 dB in air conduction. Subjective satisfaction score was 8-10 in 42.4% patients in case group, while 25% in control group. Surgeon was fully satisfied in 73% patients of case group and 45% patients of control group. The study suggested that Singapore Swing technique provides a dry, small and stable cavity with better hearing in less time.

T1  - Pre-operative Evaluation of Eustachian Tube Function Using a Modified Pressure Equilibration Test is Predictive of Good Postoperative Hearing and Middle Ear Aeration in Type 1 Tympanoplasty Patients
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Eustachian tube (ET) plays an important role in maintaining a normally aerated middle ear. Inflammation in middle ear disease is related to ET dysfunction, and postoperative restoration of middle ear integrity and hearing are closely related to ET function in chronic ear disease patients. After successful tympanoplasty, restoration of a well-aerated middle ear with good ET function can permit better compliance of the tympanic membrane. In this study, we evaluated the predictive validity of preoperative ET function measurements.METHODS: We reviewed 137 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty. All patients had non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media and received canal wall-up-type tympanomastoidectomies. Patients were categorized into four groups according to preoperative ET function measurements using a modified pressure inflation-deflation equilibration test. Group I patients had residual pressures less than 10 daPa, and Group IV patients showed no pressure change (poor results). Groups II and III were intermediate. Hearing levels were determined using pure tone averages at four frequencies. Postoperative tympanography was performed to determine middle ear aeration.RESULTS: The preoperative air bone (AB) gap was 29.6+/-7.0 dB, and the postoperative gap was 16.5+/-5.7 dB; thus, there was significant overall improvement. In all groups, hearing was significantly better after surgery, but the worst postoperative hearing level was seen in Group IV patients. Type B tympanograms were more frequently recorded in Group IV patients than they were in Group I or II patients. Postoperative AB gaps were 9.2+/-3.8 dB in patients with type A tympanograms, 13.4+/-2.1 dB in those with type As, 24.1+/-2.5 dB in those with type C, and 18.5+/-2.8 dB in those with type B.CONCLUSION: ET function measured with a modified pressure equilibration test using an inflation-deflation manometric method is a good indicator of an aerated middle ear and is predictive of improved postoperative hearing.

T1  - Obliteration of radical cavities with autogenous cortical bone; long-term results
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the long-term surgical outcome(s) in patients who have undergone canal-wall-down operation with mastoid and epitympanic obliteration using autologous cortical bone chips, bone pate and meatally-based musculoperiosteal flap technique.METHOD: Retrospective evaluation of seventy patients operated during 1986-1991 due to a cholesteatoma. An otomicroscopy was performed to evaluate the postoperative outer ear canal configuration with a modified Likert scale (1 - 4). The outer ear canal physical volume was assessed by tympanometry. The hearing outcome and a patient-filled questionnaire were also analyzed.RESULTS: The posterior wall results were 1.8 (+/- 0.9 SD) and the attic region 1.8 (+/- 0.9 SD) (ns., p > 0.05). These values show either no cavity formation or minor formation of a cavity, with a good functional result. The mean volume of the operated ear canal was 1.7 (+/- 0.5 SD) ml. The volume of the contralateral ear canal was 1.2 (+/- 0.3 SD) ml (*** p < 0.0001). A comparison of the current mean ABG to the preoperative mean ABG and to the ABG at one-year postoperatively, 5-years postoperatively or 10-years postoperatively showed no statistical significance (p > 0.05).CONCLUSION: ABG does not significantly change in the long-term. The configuration of the cavity tends to change, however, the obliteration material is stable in the long-term and clinically significant cavitation rarely occurs.

T1  - Rehabilitation of the tympanomastoid cavity in Canal Wall Down procedures
AB  - During 1980 to 2004, 1602 Canal Wall Down (CWD) procedures was performed of which 978 had primary surgery and 624 were revision cases. We have highlighted various methods for total clearance of disease process from the tympanomastoid area, making of a smooth cavity, augmentation of middle ear space for better functional results, inlay temporalis fascia grafting, ossiculoplasty with live tissue grafts, natural obliteration of the cavity and meatoplasty.Healing of cavity and tympanic membrane (TM) graft was achieved in 1548 (94.2%) of cases. Revision surgery was performed in 32 cases for recurrence or residual cholesteatoma, mostly in the attic and middle ear. Persisting discharge was present in 12 cases. Serviceable hearing (airbone (A-B) gap closure up to 20 dB) was achieved in 1017 (63.5%) cases. Hearing was worse than pre-operative level in 154 (9.6%) cases. There was no improvement in hearing in 397 (24.8%) cases. Serviceable hearing was obtained after second stage ossiculoplasty in 34 (2%) cases.

T1  - Chronic suppurative otitis media following paediatric cochlear implantation
AB  - The objective of this study was to report and discuss the management of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) following cochlear implantation in children. The study was a retrospective review of 650 patients receiving an implant at two paediatric tertiary referral centres for cochlear implantation. Nine patients were identified who developed CSOM following cochlear implantation (incidence 1.38%). The mean time interval between implantation and symptom development was 3.66 years (range 2-8 years) and the mean time interval between implantation and CSOM surgery was 5.02 years (range 2.2-8 years). All patients presented with otorrhoea and/or abscess formation over the implant site. Two patients underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy and seven underwent a combined approach tympanoplasty, three of whom required posterior canal wall reconstruction with cortical bone and one with cartilage. In four cases it was possible to remove the cholesteatoma without removing the implant. All but two patients were fitted with a contralateral implant. In the explanted ears the cochlear implant electrode was cut at the cochleostomy site, which was then covered with muscle. Chronic suppurative otitis media following cochlear implantation may occur either as a result of a posterior canal wall defect related to surgery or possibly de novo. Attempts should be made to save the implant, but explantation with reimplantation of the contralateral ear may be the only option. In these cases the intracochlear part of the electrode array should be left in situ to facilitate possible future reimplantation. Surgical options for management of CSOM should be individualized and may include both canal-wall up and canal-wall down techniques. To reduce the incidence of CSOM following implantation the authors recommend: (1) prompt treatment and careful follow-up of patients with a history of otitis media with effusion, (2) avoidance of excessive thinning of the posterior canal wall during mastoidectomy and (3) reconstruction of any accidental trauma to the annulus or posterior canal wall during posterior tympanotomy.

T1  - Retraction pockets in chronic suppurative otitis media- our experience
AB  - Retractions of the tympanic membrane constitute a large proportion of ear diseases causing concern to the otologist. The clinical features in a case of retraction pocket are varied and cholesteatoma. Also, that a retraction pocket in the posterosuperior region and pars ftaccida is a precursor of cholesteatoma is now well recognized. We have studied 60 cases of retraction pockets during a period of 5 years and have attempted to find out the etiology as well as the most effective treatment in such cases. Though over the years along with a dysfunctional eustachian tube, a sclerotic mastoid has been implicated as one of the causes of Retraction Pockets, we in our study have seen a large sized mastoid antrum (beyond 2 mm vf Lateral Semicircular Canal) as a consistent feature in most of our cases. This was subjectively assessed as a surgical finding in tympanomastoidectomy and objectively assessed by a high Resolution Computed Tomography of the temporal bone. We have found that a canal wall down mastoidectomy was the most effective in preventing the recurrence of retraction pockets. In a coutry like India, canal wall down mastoidectomy offers an acceptable solution to the problem of retraction pocket as not only is the follow up of patients poor but also the "Second- Look" procedure is not always possible. The use of 1- 0 chromic catgut in the middle ear instead of the more conventionally used silastic in preventing recurrent retractions can be considered as an effective single-staged procedure.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration using temporo-parietal fascia flap-our experience
AB  - The management of cholesteatomatous ear disease by open cavity mastoidectomy is plagued by a number of cavity problems. A chronically discharging cavity besides being a frustrating dilemma to the surgeon is also a social handicap to the patient. Obliteration of such discharging cavities seems to be an effective therapeutic modality. This paper deals with mastoid obliteration using a vascularized axial pattern temporoparietal fascia flap. Twenty post-mastoidectomy cases were retrospectively studied for cavity problems and prospectively for efficacy of the technique in terms of achieving a dry ear and hearing improvement. Also included is an extensive review of literature regarding the various causes of cavity problems and techniques of obliteration.

T1  - Lateral Attic Wall Reconstruction with Glass Ionomer Bone Cement in the Management of Primary Acquired Attic Cholesteatoma in Children: A Preliminary Experience
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of glass ionomer bone cement (GIBC) in lateral attic wall reconstruction after primary acquired attic cholesteatoma surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted on twenty children collected from the ENT outpatient clinics of a secondary and tertiary hospital. All patients presented with chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma of the primary acquired attic type. All patients underwent intact canal wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) with a transcanal atticotomy to address primary cholesteatoma involving the attic and the supratubal recess. Removal of the incus with or without decapitation of the malleus depended on the extension of the pathology. GIBC was used to build up the lateral attic wall in all cases. Ossiculoplasty and tympanoplasty were performed according to the extent of disease.RESULTS: All patients had integrated skin covering the reconstructed attic wall with no signs of granulation tissue formation, canal wall edema, glass ionomer extrusion, or foreign body reaction on the 6th month, 1st year and 2nd year follow-up visits. Also, no persistent otorrhea was noted. The postoperative air-bone gap was significantly improved (p=0.007).CONCLUSION: GIBC could be considered as a reliable artificial material for reconstruction of the lateral attic wall after transmeatal atticotomy in ICWM, making it feasible to avoid cavity problems of canal wall down mastoidectomy, especially in children.

T1  - Assessment of Mastoid Function with Magnetic Resonance Imaging after Canal Wall Up Cholesteatoma Surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of mastoid opacification after canal wall up (CWU) cholesteatoma surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five children in whom post-operative MRI had been obtained after CWU surgery. Cholesteatoma confined to the meso- and/or epi-tympanum was removed using a transcanal approach (n=18). More extensive disease required a combined approach tympanomastoidectomy (CAT, n=17). Mastoid opacification was assessed in both ears by a neuroradiologist blind to surgical details using an ordinal scale from 0 (no opacification) to 6 (completely opacified). The primary outcome measure was presence of normal mastoid ventilation, defined by evaluation of non-operative ears as a score <=2. The presence of normal ventilation, as well as the raw opacification scores, were compared according to type of cholesteatoma surgery: 1) transcanal, with no mastoidectomy and 2) CAT.RESULTS: Mastoid ventilation was normal in 18 post-operative ears (51%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of normally ventilated mastoids in the CAT (n=17) and transcanal (n=18) groups (p=0.318; Fisher's exact). However, mastoid opacification scores were significantly higher in the CAT group than in the transcanal group (p=0.036; Mann-Whitney U).CONCLUSION: The mastoid frequently fails to become normally ventilated after cholesteatoma surgery. Subgroup analysis suggests cortical mastoidectomy does not increase the likelihood of normal mastoid ventilation after CWU cholesteatoma surgery. MRI provides a non-invasive tool to assess mastoid function, which contributes to the current debate on optimum surgical strategies for management of the mastoid in cholesteatoma surgery. Further research will determine whether this measure of mastoid health correlates with risk of recurrent cholesteatoma.

T1  - Recidivous cholesteatoma: DWI MR after canal wall up and canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between preoperative non-echo planar diffusion-weighted (non-EPI DWI) MR imaging with surgical findings of recidivous middle ear cholesteatoma after canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy.BACKGROUND: The detection of recidive cholesteatoma after CWU and after CWD procedures, when the trepanation cavity is spontaneously closed by soft tissue, is possible by second-look and revision surgery. However, many cases prove to be negative of the disease. To avoid unnecessary operational risks we adopted a novel imaging method to evaluate its potential in the detection of recidivous cholesteatoma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospective study included 27 cases. Fifteen cases were revised after CWD and 12 cases were second-look surgeries after CWU procedures. All patients underwent the MR protocol: T2-weighted, T1-weighted and non-EPI DWI. The finding on MR correlated with peroperative presence of cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Non-EPI DWI sequence showed an increased signal intensity in 16/27 (59 %) cases. This correlated with surgical findings in all 7 patients after CWU and in 8 patients after CWD. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of non-EPI DWI were 83.3 %, 88.8 %, 93.8 % and 72.7 %, respectively. DWI presented a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 85.7 % in the subgroup of patients after CWD mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: Residual and/or recurrent cholesteatoma can be accurately detected by DWI MR. It can be used as a screening method to select patients, who are indicated to second-look or revision surgery after CWU and CWD mastoidectomy (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 49).

T1  - Long-term Results of the Cartilage Shoe Technique to Anchor a Titanium Total Ossicular Replacement Prosthesis on the Stapes Footplate After Type III Tympanoplasty
AB  - Importance: Multiple techniques for a more secure and stable anchoring of the foot of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) on the footplate have been proposed. To address this issue, a technique was developed that fits a cartilage shoe into the oval niche to guide the base of the prosthesis into a preformed central perforation.Objective: To evaluate the long-term results of the cartilage shoe technique used to anchor a titanium TORP on the stapes footplate in patients after type III tympanoplasty.Design, Setting, and Participants: Medical record review of total ossiculoplasties at a single center. The study included all patients who had undergone a tympanoplasty using a TORP between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2008, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.Main Outcomes and Measures: Hearing thresholds were determined by a 4-frequency (500-4000 Hz) pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG). Intraoperative findings from revision surgery and second-look operations are reported.Results: Forty-two ears were eligible for follow-up examination, averaging 6.8 years (range, 4.8-9.1 years) after surgery, that comprised otoscopy and audiometry. The mean age of 22 women and 20 men was 42.8 years (age range, 6-78 years). The overall PTA-ABG decreased from a mean (SD) of 33.0 (8.4) decibels (dB) before surgery to a mean (SD) of 22.0 (10.1) dB after surgery (P <= .001, eta = 0.402). Before surgery, 64% (27 of 42) of the patients had a PTA-ABG exceeding 30 dB, which was 30 dB or less in 76% (32 of 42) of the patients after surgery. After canal wall down (n = 18) and tympanoplasties with intact canal wall (n = 24), the PTA-ABG was reduced from a mean (SD) of 33.0 (8.9) dB to 24.6 (11.2) dB (P = .01, eta = 0.271) and from a mean (SD) of 32.0 (7.3) dB to 19.6 (9.2) dB (P <= .001, eta = 0.511), respectively. For transmeatal revision ossiculoplasty (n = 33), the PTA-ABG improved from a mean (SD) of 32.0 (8.6) dB to 21.0 (10.2) dB (P <= .001, eta = 0.389), similar to primary ossiculoplasty (n = 9), with a mean (SD) of 33.0 (5.5) dB PTA-ABG before surgery and a mean (SD) of 21.0 (9.8) dB PTA-ABG after surgery (P = .005, eta = 0.478). Intraoperative findings from revision surgery (n = 11) during the study period and second-look procedures (n = 7) showed that the cartilage shoe prevented a lift off the footplate in all but 2 patients, even in the presence of recurrent cholesteatoma.Conclusions and Relevance: The use of the cartilage shoe that anchors a titanium TORP on the stapes footplate can be advocated for good and reliable long-term results after total ossiculoplasty.

T1  - Long term results of the titanium clip prosthesis
AB  - The objective of the study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using the clip titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis. This study retrospectively reviews the partial ossiculoplasty conducted using clip titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis at a tertiary referral center. Audiometric outcomes and intraoperative findings were postoperatively measured from revision surgery of 47 ears (20 women, 27 men, mean age 43 years) averaging 6.5 years. The overall air-bone gap decreased from 25.7 dB preoperatively to 16.8 dB 6.5 years postoperatively (p <= 0.001, eta p2 = 0.210). An air-bone gap of <20 dB was present in 28 % of ears preoperatively and increased to 72 % postoperatively. In revision (n = 30) and primary tympanoplasties (n = 17), the preoperative air-bone gaps were reduced from 28.9 and 20.1 to 18.7 dB (p <= 0.001, eta p2 = 0.240) and 13.2 dB (p = 0.033, eta p2 = 0.192), respectively. In canal wall down (n = 15) procedures and tympanoplasties with intact canal wall (n = 32), the mean air-bone gaps diminished from 28.9 to 18.1 dB (p = 0.02, eta p2 = 0.245) and 24.2 to 16.1 dB (p <= 0.001, eta p2 = 0.221), respectively. In our own revision tympanoplasties (n = 8) and second look operations (n = 6), we found that the prostheses were safe to remove without any deleterious effects. Two prostheses were dislocated from the stapes' head due to recurrent cholesteatoma. Therefore, it can be concluded that ossiculoplasty using the clip partial ossicular replacement prosthesis allows for good and reliable long term hearing results. Also, the flexible strips reveal no adverse effects on the encompassed stapes' head and do not complicate revision surgery.

T1  - [Analyses of the operative efficacy of 102 cases of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of operations of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 102 patients whom received tympanoplasty with CWU or CWD with mastoid obliteration in our hospital between January 2014 and December 2014. Patients were divided into different groups according to types of the cholesteatoma as well as the different surgical procedures. Patients were followed up for 12-24 months, the pre and post-operative PTA was performed and evaluated. The post-operative hearing was assessed in terms of average ABG.RESULTS: The average dry ear time was (5.4+/-1.7)weeks. The dry ear time of patients of attic cholesteatoma was shorter than those of tensa cholesteatoma[(4.9+/-1.7)weeks vs(6.1+/-1.5)weeks, t=-3.52, P=0.001]; the dry ear time of patients underwent CWU was shorter than those underwent CWD with mastoid obliteration[(2.3+/-0.5)weeks vs(5.8+/-1.4)weeks, t=-8.43, P=0.000]. Mean pre and post-operative air bone gaps in 93 ears underwent ossiculoplasty were (34.2+/-11.8)dB and (19.0+/-5.5)dB respectively and these differences were statistically significant. Both the pre and post-operative air bone gaps of ears of attic cholesteatoma were smaller than those ears of tensa cholesteatoma(P<0.05). In the patients who underwent ossiculoplasty with CWD with mastoid obliteration, the post-operative air bone gaps of attic cholesteatoma were smaller than those of tensa cholesteatoma(P<0.05). Both the pre and post-operative air bone gaps of ears underwent CWU were smaller than those underwent CWD with mastoid obliteration(P<0.05). The post-operative air bone gaps of ears underwent PORP with CWD with mastoid obliteration were smaller than those underwent TORP with CWD with mastoid obliteration(P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Both the hearing loss and the outcome of tensa cholesteatoma are worser than attic cholesteatoma. The outcome of PORP is better than TORP. The patients who will accept CWU should be selected more carefully and be followed up regularly.

T1  - [Analyses of the factors relevant to revision tympanomastoid surgery]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze factors relevant to revisional tympanomastoid surgery for chronic otitis media(COM).METHODS: The clinical data of 159 patients (159 ears), who exhibited either wet ear or relapsed after the initial operation, and were subjected to revisional tympanomastoid surgery, were retrospectively analyzed in this study. Of those 159 consecutive patients, 85 were males and 74 were females, aged 11-64 years, with a median age of 36 years old. The situations in terms of intra-operative findings, surgical procedures, change dressing post-operation, dry ear time, and the improvement of aural ability during the second operation, were recorded and analyzed.RESULTS: The second surgery found that, of those 159 patients underwent the re-operation, 67 presented with cholesteatoma and 92 had no cholesteatoma. In addition, the inadequate skeletonization and insufficient opening for mastoid cavity accounted for 70.4% (112/159) of all previous operations, the external auditory canal stenosis for 98.7% (157/159), the high facial ridge leading to insufficient drainage for 61.0% (97/159), the lesion in tympanic ostium of Eustachian tube for 34.6% (55/159), the insufficient drainage due to inappropriate post-operating dressing for 5.0% (8/159), the postauricular incision for 30.8% (49/159), and the endaural incision for 69.2% (110/159). As for the re-operation of the canal wall down mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha were performed in 94 cases, the modified Bondy plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha in four cases, the radical mastoidectomy plus plastic repairing of cavity of concha in 59 cases, and the simple cleaning for mastoid cavity in two cases. Since one to two weeks after the revisional operations, the post-operating dressing was performed with aid of microscopy once a week on average. The average dry ear time ranged from 2 to 6 weeks (median=3 weeks). During a period of 6-93 months for the follow-up, all patients presented with dry ears. The epithelialization of the operating cavity was well and the tympanic membranes were integrity. Neither granulation tissue nor cholesteatoma was found to reoccur. Both pure tone hearing thresholds and air-bone gap decreased in 87 cases after the revisional operation, with statistically significant different in comparison to those two parameters before the operation (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: The primary causes responsible for the wet ear or reoccurrent cholesteatoma after tympanomastoid surgery may be related to the improper operation procedures and selection of incision, the non-standard operation, inexhaustive removal of pathological tissues, as well as the irregular postoperation change dressing, and other factors.

T1  - How I do it: modified Todd's meatoplasty
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic otorrhoea after canal wall down mastoidectomy can be a clinical challenge. Basic principles for canal wall down surgery include establishing a large meatus. Several meatoplasty techniques have been reported. This paper describes this new indication for Todd's meatoplasty with surgical improvements.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral centre.METHODS: Modifications of transposition postauricular flap meatoplasty are reported. This technique was applied in a series of patients with chronic otorrhoea after a canal wall down mastoidectomy.RESULTS: In general, a dry radical cavity was successfully created within six weeks and follow-up visits at the out-patient clinic were reduced. Only minor complications occurred, which are all reported.CONCLUSION: The postauricular flap meatoplasty is a valuable tool in the management of chronic otorrhoea after an open cavity approach for cholesteatoma.

T1  - Use of Pericranial Flap Coverage in Cochlear Implantation of the Radical Cavity: Rationale, Technique, and Experience
AB  - Cochlear implant (CI) surgery in the setting of an open mastoid cavity is evolving. Two strategies are commonly pursued: a staged approach, clearing the disease, closing the meatus or the external auditory canal (EAC), and reevaluating in 3 to 6 months prior to implantation, or a single-stage procedure with mastoid obliteration without EAC closure. Meatal closure is often employed in the setting of an open mastoid cavity to reduce the risk of electrode extrusion and infection. An open cavity offers the advantages of being a single-stage procedure, permitting direct surveillance for recurrent cholesteatoma, and reducing the need for repeat computed tomography scans. We describe an approach to the coverage of a CI within a dry, open mastoid cavity using an anteriorly-based postauricular pericranial flap.

T1  - Cost analysis and outcomes of a second-look tympanoplasty-mastoidectomy strategy for cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To analyze cost and compare cholesteatoma recidivism and hearing outcomes with single-stage and second-look operative strategies.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review and cost analysis.METHODS: Adult and pediatric patients who underwent a tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma with a single-stage or second-look operative strategy were identified. Variables included procedure approach, residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, ossicular chain reconstruction frequency, and operative complications. Audiologic outcomes included pre-/postoperative air bone gap (ABG) and word recognition score (WRS). Cost analysis included charges for consultation and follow-up visits, surgical procedures, computed tomography temporal bone scans, and audiology visits.RESULTS: One hundred and six patients had a tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma, with 80 canal wall-up procedures (CWU) as initial approach. Of these, 46 (57.5%) CWU patients had a planned second look. Two (4.3%) CWU patients had recurrent cholesteatoma and 20 (43.4%) had residual identified at second look. Four (11.7%) single-stage CWU strategy patients developed recurrent cholesteatoma. There was no significant difference in pre-/postoperative ABG and WRS between second look and single stage (P > 0.05). Compared to second-look patients, single-stage patients had significantly fewer postoperative visits (6.32 vs. 10.4; P = 0.007), and significantly lower overall charges for care ($23,529. vs. $41.411; P < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: The goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to produce a safe ear, and a second-look strategy after CWU has historically been used to evaluate for recurrent or residual disease. The cholesteatoma recurrence rate at a second look after a CWU tympanoplasty-mastoidectomy is low. Costs of operative procedures are a significant proportion of healthcare resource expenditures. Considering the low rate of cholesteatoma recurrence and relatively high cost of care, implementation of a second-look strategy should be individually tailored and not universally performed.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

T1  - Pooled analysis of the evidence for open cavity, combined approach and reconstruction of the mastoid cavity in primary cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesteatoma is keratinising epithelium within the middle-ear cleft or mastoid. This disease destroys the peripheral organs of balance and hearing, with possible intracranial sequelae. The management of cholesteatoma is surgical and the primary aim is to remove the disease and prevent recurrence. Secondary aims are to obtain a non-discharging, hearing ear. Cholesteatoma surgery falls into two broad categories: open cavity surgery and combined approach surgery. A third surgical category is reconstruction of an open mastoid cavity after open surgery. This study performed a pooled analysis of the worldwide literature to compare the rates of cholesteatoma not being cured (i.e. recidivism), ear discharge and hearing change among open cavity, combined approach and reconstruction mastoid surgery for primary cholesteatoma.METHODS: A literature search for all types of cholesteatoma surgery in the PubMed, Google Scholar and Medline databases and in published conference proceedings was undertaken.RESULTS: There was no level 1 evidence for the best method of primary cholesteatoma surgery. The highest evidence level found (level 2; 5366 patients) shows no difference in hearing change or discharge rate between open and combined approach surgery; however, these methods fail to cure the cholesteatomas in 16.0 per cent and 29.4 per cent of cases, respectively. In a total of 640 patients, reconstruction and/or repair mastoid surgery using a variety of non-comparable techniques had a failure rate of between 5.3 per cent and 20 per cent.CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that reconstruction of the posterior canal wall and/or obliteration of the mastoid may be the best surgical treatment alternative. This technique appears to provide the lowest recidivism rate combined with a low post-operative ear discharge rate.

T1  - Management of pediatric cholesteatoma based on presentations, complications, and outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To highlight important aspects and paradigms in the management of paediatric cholesteatoma in a developing world setting.METHODS: A retrospective audit was conducted of paediatric cholesteatomas that underwent tympanomastoid surgery between 2008 and 2012 at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town. The following was audited: initial presentation; cholesteatoma complications; types of surgery, intraoperative findings and outcomes of surgery in terms of hearing, otorrhoea and recidivism; and the reliability of follow-up and how this might influence the type of surgery.RESULTS: Fifty-seven children aged 2-13 years with 61 cholesteatomas (4 bilateral) were reviewed. Fifty-five mastoidectomies were done; 11% presented with complicated cholesteatoma. Referrals from primary care were significantly delayed (>6 months) in 76%. Canal wall down surgery was done in 71%. Forty-five percent had improved hearing (within 15dB of better hearing ear) and a further 15% had no or only mild hearing loss. Ossicular chain involvement and ossicles encased in inflammatory tissue were associated with poorer hearing outcomes. Sixty-four percent of ears remained dry. Forty-five percent of the canal wall up, and 23% of canal wall down mastoidectomies had recidivism. Twenty-six percent of patients were lost to follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: Children are likely to present with advanced cholesteatoma with ossicular chain involvement. The children present with high rates of complications, poor pre-operative hearing and have high recurrence rates post-surgery. Referral from primary health care is delayed. Canal wall down procedures may be appropriate in a setting where patient follow-up is unreliable and access to operating theatre is limited. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - A Systematic Review of Non-Echo Planar Diffusion-Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Detection of Primary and Postoperative Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of non-echo planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for primary and recurrent/residual (postoperative) cholesteatoma in adults (>=18 years) after canal wall up surgery.DATA SOURCES: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane up to October 22, 2014.REVIEW METHODS: All studies investigating non-echo planar DW-MRI for primary and postoperative cholesteatoma were selected and critically appraised for relevance and validity.RESULTS: In total, 779 unique articles were identified, of which 23 articles were included for critical appraisal. Seven articles met our criteria for relevance and validity for postoperative cholesteatoma. Four studies were additionally included for subgroup analysis of primary cases only. Ranges of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value yielded 43%-92%, 58%-100%, 50%-100% and 64%-100%, respectively. Results for primary subgroup analysis were 83%-100%, 50%-100%, 85%-100%, and 50%-100%, respectively. Results for subgroup analysis for only postoperative cases yielded 80%-82%, 90%-100%, 96%-100%, 64%-85%, respectively. Despite a higher prevalence of cholesteatoma in the primary cases, there was no clinical difference in added value of DW-MRI between primary and postoperative cases.CONCLUSION: We found a high predictive value of non-echo planar DW-MRI for the detection of primary and postoperative cholesteatoma. Given the moderate quality of evidence, we strongly recommend both the use of non-echo planar DW-MRI scans for the follow-up after cholesteatoma surgery, and when the correct diagnosis is questioned in primary preoperative cases.

T1  - Human Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in the Treatment of Postoperative Temporal Bone Defect: An Animal Model
AB  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy is one of the most effective treatments for cholesteatoma. However, it results in anatomical changes in the external and middle ear with a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. To provide complete closure of the mastoid cavity and normalize the anatomy of the middle and external ear, we used human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), GMP grade, in a guinea pig model. A method for preparing a biomaterial composed of hMSCs, hydroxyapatite, and tissue glue was developed. Animals from the treated group were implanted with biomaterial composed of hydroxyapatite and hMSCs, while animals in the control group received hydroxyapatite alone. When compared to controls, the group implanted with hMSCs showed a significantly higher ratio of new bone formation (p = 0.00174), as well as a significantly higher volume percentage of new immature bone (p = 0.00166). Our results proved a beneficial effect of hMSCs on temporal bone formation and provided a promising tool to improve the quality of life of patients after canal wall down mastoidectomy by hMSC implantation.

T1  - A retrospective study on post-operative hearing of middle ear cholesteatoma patients with labyrinthine fistula
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant change in bone conduction threshold after operation, so the tympanoplasty can be done to maintain hearing when conditions allow.OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of surgical treatment on hearing of cholesteatoma patients with labyrinthine fistula.METHODS: The clinical data of 35 patients (35 ears) with labyrinthine fistula, which were caused by cholesteatoma, were analyzed retrospectively. The hearing of 21 patients was followed up.RESULTS: Three months to 5 years follow-up of 21 patients were accomplished by pure tone audiometry and other details. There was no recurrent cholesteatoma in the patients. Compared with pre-operative average bone conduction at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz, 12 cases had a difference less than 5 dB, three patients' hearing improved (more than 10 dB), and five cases declined (more than 10 dB). One patient received cochlear implantation 3 months after the surgery. The average bone and air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz had no obvious change (p > 0.05) in 11 patients managed by a canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty.

T1  - Revision surgery for canal wall down mastoidectomy: intra-operative findings and results
AB  - CONCLUSION: Canal wall down mastoid surgery following multiple earlier surgical failures can be revised by a well-trained experienced surgeon. A dry and safe ear is obtainable in most patients, and hearing preservation is also possible.OBJECTIVES: To analyze the intra-operative findings in revision surgery for canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy and to ascertain the prognosis.METHODS: A total of 76 revision mastoidectomies with tympanoplasties performed from March 2008 to May 2014 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in China were reviewed. The pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data was recorded and analyzed.RESULTS: The possible reason of previous surgical failures were confirmed by the operative findings, which included inadequate mastoidectomy or persistent air-cell disease (66/76 [86.8%]), recurrent or persistent cholesteatoma (44/76 [57.9%]), excessive opened cavity combined with complications (9/76 [11.8%]), and infected cavities (68/76 [89.5%]). In this study, disease control was achieved in 70 (92.1%) patients. Complications following previous surgery were modified by revision surgery. Hearing was significantly improved in the 54 cases with ossicular replacement prosthesis. After a mean follow-up of 22 months, the group of revision surgery with ossiculoplasty as a whole experienced a statistically significant hearing gain of 16.57 +/- 11.96 dB (p < 0.05) at air conduction pure tone average (PTA).

T1  - The disease recurrence rate after the canal wall up or canal wall down technique in adults
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To review which type of cholesteatoma surgery, canal wall up (CWU) or canal wall down (CWD), provides the lowest risk for residual and/or recurrent disease in adults with primary acquired cholesteatoma.DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Scopus and Web of Science.STUDY DESIGN: We selected articles comparing CWU with CWD, reporting on disease recidivism (combined residual and recurrent disease) or independent residual or disease recurrence rates. We included studies with a moderate to high relevance.RESULTS: Our search yielded 2,060 articles. We selected seven studies that carried a moderate risk of bias. Six studies described higher disease recidivism after the CWU procedure [16.7-61.0%] compared to the CWD technique [0-13.2%]. Four studies showed statistical significant difference (P < .05). One study showed opposite results: recidivism was found in 7.8% CWU and in 22.1% CWD cases (P < .001). Studies showed CWU recidivism more likely to be residual disease, whereas CWD recidivism tended to be recurrent disease.CONCLUSION: The majority of included studies showed CWU to result in more disease recidivism compared to the CWD technique in adult patients with a primary acquired cholesteatoma. If recidivism risk is the most important factor to consider a certain surgical technique, we recommend application of the CWD procedure. However, many additional factors in patient care will define the best treatment decision, such as residual hearing and access to health care. Our recommendations are based on Level II evidence, which underlines the need for future high-level evidence studies.

T1  - The Bony Obliteration Tympanoplasty in Pediatric Cholesteatoma: Long-term Safety and Hygienic Results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the safety and hygienic results of a 5-year longitudinal study in a pediatric population undergoing surgery for extensive cholesteatoma using a canal wall up approach with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective consecutive study.PATIENTS: Thirty-three children (<=18 yr) undergoing surgery for cholesteatoma (34 ears) between 1997 and 2009.INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 1) Residual and recurrent cholesteatoma rates at 5-year postsurgery, 2) postoperative waterproofing and hygienic status of the ear, and 3) required operation rate to achieve the safety and hygienic goals.RESULTS: At 5 years no patients were lost in follow-up. This consecutive series design is rare in chronical otitis media treatment reporting. The standard residual rate at 5 years was 5.8%, representing two residual cholesteatomas in the middle ear. The standard recurrence rate at 5 years was 2.9%, representing one recurrent cholesteatoma. At 5-year follow-up all ears were free of otorrhea and waterproof and all external ear canals were patent and self-cleaning. The operation rate to reach this safety and hygienic status was 1.5 operations per ear at 5-year follow-up.CONCLUSION: The use of a canal wall up approach with obliteration of the mastoid cavity and epitympanic space to surgically treat cholesteatoma in children results in low residual and recurrence rates and a high rate of trouble-free ears in the long term.

T1  - Does Checking the Placement of Ossicular Prostheses via the Posterior Tympanotomy Improve Hearing Results After Cholesteatoma Surgery?
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Posterior tympanotomy (PT) is often performed during the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma with extension in the retrotympanum area. This PT can also be used to control the right position of the ossicular prosthesis masked by the tympanic membrane reconstruction.OBJECTIVE: To compare audiologic results after ossiculoplasty performed via the outer ear canal and via the PT for patients with cholesteatoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart reviews were performed for 68 patients (68 ears) with cholesteatoma who underwent titanium ossicular prosthesis surgery between January 2007 and January 2011. We compared audiologic results between two groups: the WPT group (the group without checking the prosthesis via the PT) and the PT group (the group with placing and/or checking the prosthesis via the PT). A postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap of 20 dB or less was considered a successful hearing result.RESULTS: Of the patients who underwent canal wall-up mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma with ossicular chain reconstruction by titanium prosthesis, 36 patients (20 total ossicular replacement prosthesis [TORP], 16 partial ossicular replacement prosthesis [PORP]) were in the PT group and 32 patients (16 TORP, 16 PORP) were in the WPT group. The global success rate (defined as a mean residual air-bone gap < 20 dB) was 50% in the WPT group (56% in the subgroup PORP, 44% in the subgroup TORP) and 42% in the PT group (62% in PORP, 25% in TORP). There was no case with extrusion of the prosthesis in either group. No facial palsy occurred during the postoperative period for either group.CONCLUSION: Control of ossicular prosthesis positioning via the PT does not improve hearing results after ossicular chain reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery. However, this approach can be used during a second-stage procedure that avoids incisions within the external ear canal.

T1  - [Obliteration of mastoid cavities: 30 years of experience with recommendations for surgical strategy]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The obliteration of mastoid cavities is an appropriate intervention to sustainably improve patients' quality of life.MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 30 years, 843 cases of mastoid obliteration were analyzed from the pool of data resulting from 16,000 surgical procedures on the ear. The materials used by the authors included cartilage/bone, Palva flaps, and bone pate; as well as alloplastic material such as hydroxyapatite (HA) and bioactive glass granules (BAG S53P4) from BonAlive (BonAlive Biomaterials Ltd., Turku, Finland). Pathological findings included rejection with inflammation, granulation of the auditory canal reconstruction, unclear retraction pockets, as well as shrinkage and cicatricial contraction. The follow-up interval was at least 4 months, with an average of 33 months (standard deviation +/- 27.8 months).RESULTS: Use of HA was discontinued after 18 cases, because rejection and retraction occurred in 33% of patients. The same applied for bone pate after 33 cases, with a pathological finding in 21%. The Palva flaps (145 cases) showed pathological findings in 21% of cases, primarily in the form of shrinkage (7%) and retractions (10%). Cartilage/bone pieces (516 cases) and BAG S53P4 (133 cases) only showed abnormal postoperative findings in 8% and 3%, respectively. It is recommended to focus particularly on auditory canal and canal entrance expansion during mastoid obliteration surgery. When using the bioactive glass granules, postoperative use of a mini-drain for 1-2 days is beneficial, in order to avoid accumulation of seroma fluid in the mastoid.CONCLUSION: In our experience, a combination of BAG S53P4 and cartilage as cover is a suitable material for cavity obliteration.

T1  - [Our surgical treatment results in pediatric cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate surgical techniques and obtained outcomes in pediatric cholesteatoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 patients (41 males, 21 females; mean age 13 years; range 3 to 17 years) diagnosed as pediatric cholesteatoma between January 1998 and December 2014 were enrolled into the study. Of the patients, canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy was performed in 31, canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy in 13, inside-out (ISO) mastoidectomy in eight, and tympanoplasty in 10. Surgical approaches, staging, hearing outcomes, relapse status, and surgical data were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Cholesteatoma recurred in seven patients (11%). Recurrence rates for CWU and CWD mastoidectomies were 31% and 6%, respectively. While the number of patients with good serviceable hearing (pure-tone average >=25 dB) was 10 preoperatively, it became 16 postoperatively. Ossicular erosion was higher in CWD group. Twenty-nine patients (47%) had extensive disease and CWD mastoidectomy was performed in 86% of these. Number of patients not requiring care was 45 (72.6%).CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed no differences in terms of good serviceable hearing between CWU and CWD mastoidectomies. The preferred method was mainly CWD in patients with extensive disease and ossicular erosion. Recurrence rates were higher in CWU group. Therefore, ISO or CWD mastoidectomy come to the forefront as appropriate treatment options in the treatment of pediatric cholesteatomas according to the extensiveness of disease.

T1  - Surgical results of retrograde mastoidectomy with primary reconstruction of the ear canal and mastoid cavity
AB  - The aim of this study was to retrospectively review the long-term hearing results and the impact of mastoid exclusion/obliteration in patients with cholesteatoma (102 ears) who underwent retrograde tympanomastoidectomy and in whom bone chips/pate were applied as the sole materials during the procedure. In 79 ears, this was combined with ossiculoplasty in a single-stage procedure. In >71% of ears, the results of audiometric testing were monitored for more than 2 years. The results suggested there was a significant gain in hearing following surgery, with respect to the postoperative change in both air-conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps (P < 0.001). Linear regression analyses of pure-tone averages at different frequencies, before and after surgery, demonstrated that patients benefitted from a postoperative hearing gain at low and middle frequencies, but their hearing often deteriorated at frequencies of 8000 Hz. As for the impact of the type of tympanoplasty on hearing outcomes, type III-interposition markedly increased hearing gain. The overall rate of postoperative adverse events was 8.8%. We conclude that reconstruction of the ear canal and mastoid via mastoid exclusion/obliteration using bone chips/pate can be considered as an alternative procedure following retrograde mastoidectomy. It gives excellent surgical results and has fewer postoperative adverse events.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: As the process of additive manufacturing, or three-dimensional (3D) printing, has become more practical and affordable, a number of applications for the technology in the field of pediatric otolaryngology have been considered. One area of promise is temporal bone surgical simulation. Having previously developed a model for temporal bone surgical training using 3D printing, we sought to produce a patient-specific model for pre-operative simulation in pediatric otologic surgery. Our hypothesis was that the creation and pre-operative dissection of such a model was possible, and would demonstrate potential benefits in cases of abnormal temporal bone anatomy.METHODS: In the case presented, an 11-year-old boy underwent a planned canal-wall-down (CWD) tympano-mastoidectomy for recurrent cholesteatoma preceded by a pre-operative surgical simulation using 3D-printed models of the temporal bone. The models were based on the child's pre-operative clinical CT scan and printed using multiple materials to simulate both bone and soft tissue structures. To help confirm the models as accurate representations of the child's anatomy, distances between various anatomic landmarks were measured and compared to the temporal bone CT scan and the 3D model.RESULTS: The simulation allowed the surgical team to appreciate the child's unusual temporal bone anatomy as well as any challenges that might arise in the safety of the temporal bone laboratory, prior to actual surgery in the operating room (OR). There was minimal variability, in terms of absolute distance (mm) and relative distance (%), in measurements between anatomic landmarks obtained from the patient intra-operatively, the pre-operative CT scan and the 3D-printed models.CONCLUSIONS: Accurate 3D temporal bone models can be rapidly produced based on clinical CT scans for pre-operative simulation of specific challenging otologic cases in children, potentially reducing medical errors and improving patient safety.

T1  - Endoscopic exclusive transcanal approach to the tympanic cavity cholesteatoma in pediatric patients: our experience
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study is to describe our experience in the management of tympanic cavity cholesteatoma in pediatric patients, treated with endoscopic exclusive transcanal approach.METHODS: A chart review of clinical data and videos from the operations of 54 pediatric patients, undergoing surgery between January 2007 and December 2013, was made. Patients presenting with cholesteatoma involving the tympanic cavity (mesotympanum, epitympanum, protympanum and/or hypotympanum), with no mastoid involvement, were included in the first group and underwent an exclusive transcanalar endoscopic approach (TEA). In case of mastoid extension of the pathology, patients were included in the control group and underwent a canal wall up microscopic technique (CWU).RESULTS: In this study, 34 males and 20 females, including 5 bilateral cases, giving a total of 59 ears, were reviewed. Median age was 9.6 years (range 4-16 years). 31 cholesteatomas underwent a TEA approach, while 28 underwent a CWU approach, based on inclusion criteria. No differences from congenital vs acquired form was made, due to the difficult to correctly distinguish always the two forms. The ossicular chain was preserved in 26.6% of patients (16 ears): 42% of patients (13 ears) undergoing a transcanal endoscopic approach and 10% of patients undergoing a canal wall up microscopic approach (3 ears) (P=0.006). Second look surgery was executed in 41.6% of patients (25 ears). In partial ossicular prosthesis reconstructions, the mean preoperative pure-tone average was 29.4dB, while the mean postoperative pure-tone average was 27.1dB, with a mean increase of 2.3dB. In total ossicular prosthesis reconstructions, the mean preoperative pure-tone average was 47.8dB, while the mean postoperative pure-tone average was 26.5dB, with a mean increase of 21.3dB. Recurrence rate was 12.9% (4 ears) for the transcanal endoscopic approach group and 17.2% (5 ears) for the canal wall up microscopic approach. Residual disease was present in 26.6%: 19.3% (6 ears) for the transcanal endoscopic approach group and 34.4% (10 ears) for the canal wall up microscopic approach. The mean follow up was 36 months (range 8-88). Kaplan-Meier analysis at 36 months showed a lower recurrence risk for the transcanal endoscopic approach compared with the canal wall up microscopic approach, but this data was not statistically significant (P=0.58).CONCLUSION: The transcanal endoscopic approach represents a feasible, minimally invasive and conservative technique for the management of pediatric middle ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - The one-cut meatoplasty: novel surgical technique and outcomes
AB  - PURPOSE: To present the surgical technique and clinical outcomes of a novel modification to conventional meatoplasty.MATERIALS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients undergoing canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy incorporating the one-cut meatoplasty technique between January 2009 and February 2013 were evaluated. Primary outcome measures included meatal stenosis requiring revision surgery, frequency of drainage beyond 2months postoperatively and results of a composite patient questionnaire incorporating the Chronic Ear Survey.RESULTS: Twenty-eight of 36 (78%) eligible patients completed a questionnaire and were included. All ears underwent canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy utilizing the one-cut meatoplasty technique. At a mean follow-up of 38.0months, the average Chronic Ear Survey score was 78.6+/-2.6 points. There was only one case of postoperative meatal stenosis. Intermittent otorrhea developed in 14.3% of cases but was remedied by conservative measures including in-office cleaning, ototopical therapy and water precautions. Eighty-nine percent of patients denied any self-consciousness about the aesthetic appearance of the ear.CONCLUSIONS: The one-cut meatoplasty is an effective alternative to traditional techniques that is simple to perform. The results of the Chronic Ear Survey indicate that the one-cut meatoplasty supports a stable and healthy, open cavity with functional results that compare favorably to other series evaluating canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with traditional meatoplasty. Additionally, patients report high satisfaction with the appearance of their ear, and all hearing aid users could continue to utilize a hearing aid without feedback, pain, or other difficulties related to poor fitting.

T1  - The utility of minimally invasive transcanal endoscopic approach for removal of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma: preliminary results
AB  - To investigate the feasibility of applying the transcanal endoscopic approach (TEA) for surgical treatment of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma and present the preliminary results of 17 revision procedures that were carried out with this minimally invasive approach. The records of 17 patients (aged 5-76 years) who underwent transcanal revision procedure using rigid 3-mm diameter, 0degree, 30degree and 45degree endoscopes between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. A wide posterior tympanomeatal flap was elevated via the external auditory canal and then transposed inferiorly in cases of cholesteatoma situated in the middle ear under a tympanic membrane. In certain cases, cholesteatoma was assessed and removed using the endoscopes directly from the radical cavity or from the mastoid cavity remaining after a canal-wall-down procedure. Six patients had originally undergone the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy, 6 patients had a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and 5 patients had radical mastoid cavities. The interval between the previous and the index surgery ranged between 1 and 6 years. The attic was the most common site involved with cholesteatoma, followed by the tympanic portion of the facial nerve, sinus tympani, mastoid, supratubal recess, promontory, round and oval windows. The size of residual/recurrent lesion varied between 3 and 15 mm. The patients were followed up 26-67 months (mean 52.1 months). The single recurrence (a 4-mm pearl over the tympanic portion of the facial nerve) was eradicated by a transcanal re-revision 1 year following the index surgery. Minimally invasive TEA can be successfully applied in carefully selected patients with endoscopically accessible cholesteatoma subsequent to various types of mastoidectomy.

T1  - Health-related quality of life measurement after cholesteatoma surgery: comparison of three different surgical techniques
AB  - The objective of this study was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after sequential cholesteatoma surgery including exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery with obliteration (CWD). It was a clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. 97 patients at least 12 months after cholesteatoma surgery were included. Interventions included sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM or CWD; ossiculoplasty with partial and total ossicular replacement prostheses. HRQOL assessed by Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 including an overall score and three subscores ('ear symptoms', 'hearing function' and 'mental health') as well as a general evaluation of HRQOL and the frequency of physician consultations, audiometric outcome related to HRQOL were the main outcome measures. Patients, who had undergone sequential cholesteatoma surgery, showed moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Stratified for the three surgical techniques, patients receiving ETC tended to report lower restrictions in HRQOL. The ETC group offered a significantly lower value in the subscore 'ear symptoms'. The 'hearing function' was attributed to be the most restriction criteria for all techniques. The overall score and all subscores correlated moderately with the postoperative air conduction threshold. The strongest correlation coefficient was achieved for the subscore 'hearing function' (r(s) = 0.49, p < 0.001). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery offers acceptable moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Patients receiving canal wall down surgery with obliteration showed equivalent limitations in HRQOL compared to closed techniques (ETC, TCM). The postoperative air conduction threshold was shown not to be a sufficient indicator for HRQOL. Therefore, disease-specific validated and reliable measuring instruments for HRQOL should be transferred from clinical research to clinical practice to provide an individualized postoperative assessment after cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma surgery using a single-staged canal wall down approach: results of a 5-year longitudinal study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present the results of a 5-year longitudinal study in a pediatric population undergoing surgery for extensive cholesteatoma using a canal wall down (CWD) approach with obliteration.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal study.PATIENTS: Children (<16 years) undergoing surgery for cholesteatoma (58 ears) between 1999 and 2013.INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic.SETTING: District general hospital.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Residual, recurrence, and recidivist cholesteatoma rates at 5 years post-surgery; (2) postoperative hearing; (3) postoperative waterproofing of the ear; (4) number of subsequent ear surgery required.RESULTS: Fifty-five children (58 ears) contributed to the study. At 5 years, 16 of 58 (27.6%) had been lost to follow-up. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the residual rate after 5 years was 9.9% (95% CI: 3.8-24.4%), representing four residual cholesteatomas, and there were no recurrences detected. Using a cross-sectional analysis at 12 months of follow-up, the otorrhea risk was 0% and the risk of definitive waterproofing was 94.8%. There was a re-operation risk of 17.2% within 5 years which included second-stage ossiculoplasty. Regarding hearing, of the data available (n = 16), 10 children (62.5%) maintained their hearing (change between -10 and =10 dB), 2 (12.5%) had hearing gain (>10 dB), and 4 children (25%) had hearing reduction at 12 months postoperation. Four of 16 children (25%) had a postoperative hearing level of 30 dB or lower.CONCLUSION: The use of a CWD approach with obliteration of the mastoid cavity to surgically treat extensive cholesteatoma in children results in a low recurrence rate and high rate of a trouble-free ear in the long term.

T1  - A review of current progress in acquired cholesteatoma management
AB  - The aim of this study was to review recent advances in the management of acquired cholesteatoma. All papers referring to acquired cholesteatoma management were identified in Medline via OVID (1948 to December 2013), PubMed (to December 2013), and Cochrane Library (to December 2013). A total of 86 papers were included in the review. Cholesteatoma surgery can be approached using either a canal wall up (CWU) or canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy with or without reconstruction of the middle ear cleft. In recent decades, a variety of surgical modifications have been developed including various "synthesis" techniques that combine the merits of CWU and CWD. The application of transcanal endoscopy has also recently gained popularity; however, difficulties associated with this approach remain, such as the need for one-handed surgery, the inability to provide continuous irrigation/suction, and limitations regarding endoscopic accessibility to the mastoid cavity. Additionally, several recent studies have reported successes in the application of laser-assisted cholesteatoma surgery, which overcomes the conflicting goals of eradicating disease and the preservation of hearing. Nevertheless, the risk of residual disease remains a challenge. Each of the techniques examined in this study presents pros and cons regarding final outcomes, such that any pronouncements regarding the superiority of one technique over another cannot yet be made. Flexibility in the selection of surgical methods according to the context of individual cases is essential in optimizing the outcomes.

T1  - Extensive intratemporal cholesteatomas: presentation, complications and surgical outcomes
AB  - The purpose of the study was to review the clinical features, complications, surgical management and post-operative outcomes of medially invasive extensive cholesteatomas and intracranial complications of cholesteatoma. The retrospective review was carried out at a tertiary referral center and included 20 patients presenting with extensive intratemporal cholesteatomas between 2011 and 2013. Inclusion criteria were involvement of the labyrinth, facial nerve, posterior fossa dura and intracranial complications. The mean age of the patients was 20 years. Profuse foul-smelling otorrhoea and severe otalgia/temporal headache were the most common presenting features. Intracranial complications were observed in nine patients, most commonly temporal lobe abscess; 14/20 patients exhibited profound hearing loss. One case exhibited massive labyrinthine petrous apex cholesteatoma. Labyrinthine destruction was seen in all cases of facial nerve involvement. Management of intracranial complications preceded canal wall-down mastoidectomy with or without partial labyrinthectomy and subtotal petrosectomy (transotic) with blind sac closure for petrous cholesteatoma. Facial nerve infiltration was observed in one case, whereas eight cases exhibited gross dehiscence of the fallopian canal. Disease clearance was complete in all cases with two mortalities in patients with intracranial complications. Post-operative course was uncomplicated in all other patients apart from a case of wound dehiscence. All patients remain disease free after a minimum and maximum follow-up of 6 months and 2 years, respectively. Extensive intratemporal cholesteatomas and intracranial complications caused by them continue to pose a challenge to the management of otitis media in the current era and merit early recognition, surgical management and follow-up.

T1  - Long-term surgical and functional outcomes of the intact canal wall technique for middle ear cholesteatoma in the paediatric population
AB  - In this paper, we report the postoperative outcomes in canal wall up procedures with second stage surgery in 40 children undergoing intervention for cholesteatoma of the middle ear. The residuals, recurrences and the hearing results were analysed. All 40 patients had a follow-up of at least five years. Of the 39 patients who underwent two staged surgery, 18 (46.1%) had a residual lesion that was identified and excised during the second surgery. Over a five year follow-up period, there were five (12.5%) patients with recurrences, all belonging to the group in whom a residual cholesteatoma was identified during the second staged surgery. The rate of residual cholesteatoma tends to decrease as age increases. The type of cholesteatoma, acquired or congenital middle ear, were not statistically related to the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Hearing analysis showed that hearing recovery was excellent with canal wall up procedures and remained stable over five years.

T1  - [Canal wall reconstruction with tragus cartilage and tempralis fascia graft]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This paper highlights the therapeutic effect of tragus cartilage and temporalis fascia graft on repairing bone and skin defect in external auditory canal.METHOD: Forty-one surgical patients were recuited, including 39 cases of external auditory canal cholesteatoma and 2 cases of osteoma. External auditory canal bone wall and skin defect and mastoid air cells exposure were found during operation. We followed up these cases periodically (in 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year later respectively) after repairing the patients' external auditory canal bone wall and skin with tragus cartilage and temporalis fascia graft.RESULT: Twenty-nine cases healed perfectly while other 12 cases grew small granulation in 3 weeks. After shaving granulations and tamping Tela Iodoformum, wounds healed in the following week. The epithelization of the external auditory canal in our patients was complete after 3 months and no stenosis were found. Natural morphology of external auditory canal was maintained without mastoid air cells exposure after 6 months to 1 year of time.CONCLUSION: It is not only convenient to acquire the tragus cartilage and temporalis fascia, but also easy to repair the defect of external auditory canal bone wall and skin. It can reconstruct the wall of external auditory canal, obliterate mastoid cells and perfectly maintain the normal form of external auditory canal via the cartilage.

T1  - Comparison of obliteration materials used for revision canal wall-down mastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration
AB  - AIM: To describe our surgical technique and compare the results of obliteration materials.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients over a 7-year period were evaluated retrospectively. Out of these 50 consecutive patients, 29 had recurrent chronic otitis media (COM) with or without cholesteatoma and 21 patients had old open cavities. Efficacy of mastoid obliteration was assessed by an electronic chart review, otoendoscopic findings, temporal bone computerized tomography (CT) images, and postoperative caloric test.RESULTS: Among 50 patients, inferiorly-based periosteal flap was used in 25 patients (50%) and anteriorly-based periosteal flap was used in the other 25 patients. Tympanic membrane and newly-formed external auditory canal wall was intact in 48 patients (96%). The newly-formed EAC provided sufficient aeration, and satisfactory aesthetic appearance. None of our patients complained of vertigo triggered by cold air or water. There was no significant difference in the caloric test results between the operated ear and the normal ear. No difference was observed in the caloric test between the bone pate and costal cartilage groups.CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that mastoid obliteration using autogenous bone pate or costal cartilage is helpful in improving the outcomes of revision canal wall-down mastoidectomy in patients with an old radical cavity and recurrent COM or cholesteatoma.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration for pediatric suppurative cholesteatoma: long-term safety and sustained effectiveness after 30 years' experience with cartilage obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the long-term safety of mastoid obliteration with cartilage in children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears.METHODS: The medical records of children (<=18 years) with cholesteatomas after primary tympanomastoidectomies were performed with cartilage obliteration over a 30-year period (1982-2012) were analyzed. The recidivism rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Potentially confounding factors of recidivism were entered into a Cox regression model as covariates for multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Of the 150 cholesteatomatous ears in 146 children, there were 95 discharging ears (63%) in 94 children. Among the 95 discharging ears, tympanomastoidectomy was performed with cartilage obliteration (CO group) in 77 ears (81%) and without cartilage obliteration (WO group) in 18 ears (19%). The mean follow-up period was 12 years. Recidivism was observed in 16 ears in the CO group and 4 ears in the WO group. The 10-year cumulative recidivism rates were comparable between the CO and WO groups (19 vs. 25%, p = 0.762). Multivariate analysis confirmed that mastoid obliteration was not a negative predictor of recidivism (p = 0.760). Recidivism of cholesteatoma was detected within 6.5 years after surgery in the WO group and was found as late as 16.1 years after surgery in the CO group. Cartilage could be maintained in the cavity with limited resorption, preventing reretraction pockets and subsequent recidivism.CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence supporting the long-term safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mastoid cartilage obliteration for children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears. Despite comparable recidivism rates between the groups, the potential for the delayed detection of recidivism with cavity obliteration may warrant long-term follow-up, with careful attention paid to the potential for recidivism during postoperative care in children.

T1  - Recurrence rate of cholesteatoma with autoclaved incus autograft
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the long-term recurrence rate of cholesteatoma with autoclaved incus autograft.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study between 1994 and 2009. The incus remnants were autoclaved at 134degreeC for 24 minutes at 205 kPa. The mean follow-up duration was 65.5 months, with a minimum follow-up duration of 31 months and a maximum follow-up duration of 186 months.SETTING: Secondary referral center in a district general hospital.PATIENTS: Thirty-seven cases of cholesteatoma treated with canal wall down mastoidectomy with primary ossicular reconstruction with autoclaved incus autograft were included. The age range of the patients was from 11 years to 67 years. The mean age was 38 years. Fifty-four percent was male, and 46% was female.INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic and rehabilitative--to treat and improve the patients' hearing loss secondary to cholesteatoma by using autoclaved autologous incus.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end point is the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma with a mean follow-up period of more than 5 years. Secondary end point is the audiometric outcome with air-bone gap (ABG) and air conduction improvement.RESULTS: No recurrence of cholesteatoma was observed. No graft extrusion was seen. Preoperative mean ABG was 29.8 dB. Postoperative mean ABG was 25.6 dB at the final review, with the air conduction improvement at final review at 4.2 dB.CONCLUSION: Autoclaving the incus remnant harvested from cholesteatomatous middle ear cleft is a safe and effective method to prepare an incus autograft for primary ossicular reconstruction.

T1  - Canal wall reconstruction and preservation in the surgical management of cholesteatoma in children with Down's syndrome
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Down's syndrome is associated with poor Eustachian tube function, and an increased incidence of cholesteatoma. The only previously published case series suggests that 'canal wall preserving' procedures are only rarely suitable for the management of cholesteatoma in this population.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of the hospital's clinical records database to identify patients with Down's syndrome and cholesteatoma. These patients' notes were then reviewed.RESULTS: We identified nine patients with Down's syndrome who had undergone surgical management of cholesteatoma over a twelve year period. Three patients had bilateral disease, meaning twelve ears were treated. Seven ears were initially treated with 'canal wall down' procedures. Four out of five of the remaining ears were successfully treated using 'canal wall preservation' or 'canal wall reconstruction', with one ear requiring subsequent conversion to a 'canal wall down' approach.CONCLUSION: Canal wall preservation/reconstruction is feasible in patients with Down's syndrome, even when cholesteatoma extends into the mastoid.

T1  - Relationships between facial canal dehiscence and other intraoperative findings in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between facial canal dehiscence and intraoperative middle ear and mastoid findings in patients operated on for cholesteatoma.METHODS: We examined retrospectively 334 patients who had been operated on for cholesteatoma in Izmir Katip Celebi University, Ataturk Research and Training Hospital, ENT Clinic, between April 1997 and April 2010. The patients were examined for facial canal dehiscence according to age, gender, side of the ear, surgery type, first or revision surgery, localization of the facial canal dehiscence, spread of the cholesteatoma, with the presence of lateral semi-circular canal (LSCC) fistula and any defect in the ossicle chain, and destruction in the posterior wall of the external auditory canal(EAC).RESULTS: Of the patients, 23.6% had facial canal dehiscence and detected most commonly in the right ear 28.9% and tympanic segment, 83.5%. Facial canal dehiscence was found to be 24.2-fold more common in patients with LSCC fistula and 4.1-fold more common in patients with destruction in the posterior wall of the (EAC). In patients located cholesteatoma in tympanic cavity+antrum and the tympanic cavity+all mastoid cells and with incus and stapes defect, increased incidence of dehiscence. Age, first or revision operation and canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWDT) or canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT) did not affect the incidence of dehiscence.CONCLUSIONS: That the likelihood of facial canal dehiscence occurrence is increased in patients with LSSC fistulas, destruction in the posterior wall of the EAC, or a stapes defect is important information for surgeons.

T1  - Reconstruction of the mastoid using a titanium cage
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluate reconstruction of the posterior canal wall, including the mastoid cavity after canal wall-down cholesteatoma removal.METHODS: A titanium mesh metal cage was used to rebuild the posterior auditory canal wall and mastoid cell system in 12 patients undergoing cholesteatoma removal. The cage was then covered with pieces of cartilage to reconstruct the soft tissue surface.RESULTS: All reconstructions epithelialized completely. There was no denudation of the titanium material or signs of extrusion. Recurrences of cholesteatoma occurred twice according to the condition of the underlying disease, not related to the material.CONCLUSION: The titanium cage showed good biocompatibility in the middle ear space and the potential for rebuilding the mastoid cell system, making it a versatile tool for primary cases with large defects and in revision cases where soft tissue with cartilage-only reconstructions failed. Reconstruction of the posterior canal wall and mastoid by means of a titanium cage can be used in situations where adhesive tensions need a more stable construction and support of the posterior canal wall.

T1  - Long-term results of canal wall reconstruction tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the long-term results using the technique of canal wall reconstruction (CWR) tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration in the treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Institutional review board-approved retrospective case review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Retrospective review was performed on consecutive patients undergoing CWR tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration at a single institution from 1997 to 2011.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Status of tympanic membrane and ear canal anatomy, preoperative and postoperative audiometry,residual cholesteatoma at second look surgery, postoperative complications, recurrence rate, and location.RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-five ears in 273 patients underwent CWR tympanomastoidectomy with a mean age of 35 years with average follow-up of 4.29 years (median, 3.16 yr).A second-look ossiculoplasty was performed in 253 (89%). Recurrent retraction pocket formation occurred in 34 ears (13%). A secondary endaural atticotomy only was required to improve access for debridement in 16 of these 34 ears (5.8% of total ears).Only 7 ears (2.6%) required a revision open cavity mastoidectomy(n = 5) or subtotal petrosectomy (n = 2) for recurrent cholesteatoma. Those undergoing second-look ossiculoplasty demonstrated a small improvement in preoperative versus postoperative air-bone gap (ABG), 28 dB versus 23 dB, respectively.Postoperative infection occurred in 16 patients(5.6%) with 1 patient requiring conversion to open cavity mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: A CWR tympanomastoidectomy provides excellent intraoperative exposure of the middle ear and mastoid without the long-term disadvantages of a canal wall down mastoidectomy. Long-term follow-up demonstrates that there were only 2.6% failures requiring conversion to an open cavity or subtotal petrosectomy.

T1  - Extradural granulation complicated by chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extrdural granulation or abscess is a possible complication of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) with cholesteatoma. However, due to development of newer antibiotics and advances in bacteriology and imaging techniques, the incidence of extradural granulation or abscess has significantly decreased. The present study analyzed the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and surgical treatment of eight patients with CSOM with cholesteatoma extending to the cranial fossa.PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2000 to 2012, 1,010 patients were surgically treated for CSOM with cholesteatoma. Patients with extension to the cranial fossa were studied. Clinical presentation, imaging studies, operative findings, surgical treatment, and postoperative results were evaluated.RESULTS: Twenty cases (1.9%) in a series of 1,010 patients with CSOM with cholesteatoma had bony destruction of the cranial fossa in the temporal bone computed tomography (cr). Of the 20 cases, eight (0.79%) were identified as extradural granulation by magnetic resonance imaging. One patient exhibited nodular enhancement, but it disappeared on preoperative antibiotic treatment. Surgical access for removal of cholesteatoma with extradural granulation was accomplished through canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: CSOM with cholesteatoma can extend to either the middle or posterior cranial fossa. While CT is sufficient to reveal bony destruction of the cranial fossa, magnetic resonance imaging is required to differentiate and define intracranial extension of CSOM with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Iatrogenic cholesteatoma arising at the bony-cartilaginous junction of the external auditory canal: a late sequela of intact canal wall mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe the presentation and management of a rare site of cholesteatoma recurrence at the bony-cartilaginous junction after intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case seriesSETTING: Tertiary referral centerPATIENTS: Patients with cholesteatoma formation arising from the bony-cartilaginous (BC) junction of the external auditory canal (EAC) requiring surgical intervention were retrospectively identified across a 5-year period.INTERVENTION(S): All patients were treated surgically to eradicate the disease and reconstruct the bony defect when possible.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): This observational study details the presentation, risk factors, and management of a rare site of cholesteatoma recurrence after ICW mastoidectomy.RESULTS: After ICW mastoidectomy, eight patients were identified with fistulae in the lateral EAC near the BC junction. Seven patients had associated iatrogenic cholesteatomas arising at this site, and one patient had a dry fistula with bony stenosis of the EAC. All patients had a history of chronic otitis media and previous surgery. Patients averaged 9 years between surgery and recidivism. Reconstruction of the bony defect was completed using hydroxyapatite reconstruction plates in four patients with 75% success, soft wall reconstruction in two patients using temporalis muscle, and canal wall down mastoidectomy in two patients who had extensive disease and exposed dura. No recurrent disease was evident during an average follow-up of 16 months. EAC reconstruction was successful in 83% of cases.CONCLUSION: This case series reports a novel pattern of iatrogenic cholesteatoma formation near the BC junction of the EAC that can occur years after ICW mastoidectomy. In properly selected cases, this condition can be managed with revision ICW mastoidectomy and reconstruction.

T1  - Canal wall up tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma with intact stapes. Comparison of hearing results between cartilage and PORP on stapes and impact of malleus removal and total reinforcement of the tympanic membrane by cartilage
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare the results obtained with canal wall up (CWU) tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma using cartilage or an hydroxyapatite (HA) PORP positioned on the head of the stapes and to analyse the impact of malleus removal and total reinforcement of the tympanic membrane with cartilage.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 128 cases (99 adults, 29 children) operated between 2003 and 2012 for cholesteatoma by CWU tympanoplasty with use of a cartilage graft (90 cases) or a PORP (38 cases) on the head of the stapes. Audiometric results were analysed according to the International Bureau for Audiophonology (BIAP) criteria and were submitted to statistical analysis. All ossiculoplasties were performed during the first operation and only 39% of patients required surgical revision. The malleus was preserved in 79 cases and sacrificed in 49 cases.RESULTS: With a follow-up of 2 years, the residual mean air-bone gap was 16.8 dB in the cartilage group (gain of 7.6 dB; P = 0.001) and 15.8 dB in the PORP group (gain of 8.5 dB; P = 0.002). The air-bone gap was less than 20 dB in 67.6% of cases in the cartilage group and 70.4% of cases in the PORP group. No significant difference was observed between the 2 techniques and no significant difference was observed according to whether or not the malleus was preserved in either the cartilage group or the PORP group.CONCLUSION: These results confirm the value of cartilage graft placed on the head of the stapes as ossiculoplasty technique in cholesteatoma operated by CWU tympanoplasty, giving comparable results to those obtained with a PORP. Malleus removal did not induce any reduction of the quality of hearing obtained. Total reinforcement of the tympanic membrane with cartilage appeared to decrease the cholesteatoma recurrence rate (8.5%). Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - Cholesteatoma recidivism: comparison of three different surgical techniques
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cholesteatoma recidivism rates after exclusive transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal and mastoidal technique (TCM, both subsets of intact canal wall technique, ICW), and canal wall down surgery (CWD).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review and clinical case studySETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: 406 cholesteatoma surgeries (2007-2009), 116 ears in clinical re-examination at least 1 year postoperatively.INTERVENTION: Sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM, or CWD.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cholesteatoma recidivism, residual and recurrent disease, localization of recidivism, validity of clinical findings.RESULTS: Out of 406 patients, ETC was performed in 227 (56%), TCM in 122 (30%), and CWD in 57 (14%) cases. Recidivism rates after ICW (15%) and CWD (16%) were almost similar. Recidivism was more frequent after ETC (11%) than after TCM (25%). Residuals were observed in 2% after ETC, 6.5% after TCM, and 7% after CWD. Incidence of recurrent disease was 9% for ETC, 18% for TCM, and 9% for CWD. Preferred localization of recidivism was the tympanic cavity after ETC (92%) and CWD (56%) and the mastoid cavity after TCM (53%). The clinical re-examination showed no further recidivistic disease.CONCLUSIONS: Sequential surgery is an effective and successful strategy in cholesteatoma eradication, providing a similar recidivism rate compared to following cholesteatoma retrograde and resection of the posterior canal wall. Lower recidivism after ETC was observed as a consequence of limited disease and the postoperative middle ear status determined the higher rate of recurrence after TCM. Therefore, the restricted visualization of the middle ear during ICW surgery does not increase the rate of recidivism, compared with CWD, as described in other studies. Cholesteatoma recidivism is mainly attributed to the surgeon's experience that outweighs the chosen strategy.

T1  - Contemporary changes with the use of facial nerve monitoring in chronic ear surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is a growing trend for the routine use of the facial nerve monitor (FNM) in chronic ear surgery. We aimed to examine current patterns in the use of FNMs in chronic ear surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive design (survey).SETTING: Academic health center.METHODS: A 10-question survey was designed to identify level of training, scope of practice, specific otologic surgeries where monitoring was most used, and the opinion of respondents regarding the use of FNMs as standard of care for chronic and/or middle ear surgery. A randomized list of 2000 board-certified members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was generated. One thousand subjects received a mailed survey with a self-addressed return envelope and 1000 subjects received an emailed survey through Surveymonkey.com.RESULTS: There were 359 (36%) surveys returned by mail and 258 (26%) surveys returned electronically. Forty-three percent of respondents were in private practice, and 31% were fellowship trained in otology/neurotology. Sixty-five percent used a FNM in their training and 95% had regular access to a FNM. Revision mastoid surgery, cholesteatoma, canal wall down mastoidectomy, and facial recess approach were the settings where a FNM was most used. Forty-nine percent of respondents felt that a FNM should be used as the standard of care in chronic ear surgery; this represents an increase from 32% in a similar study done approximately 10 years ago.CONCLUSION: There is a growing trend for routine facial nerve monitoring in the setting of chronic ear surgery.

T1  - Dealing with paediatric cholesteatoma: how we changed our management
AB  - We reviewed our series of surgeries for paediatric cholesteatoma to assess outcomes and functional results considering the extension of disease and surgical techniques. Between January 2003 and December 2009, 36 patients (range 6-14 years) were operated on for cholesteatoma. We considered the sites involved by the cholesteatoma (mastoid, antrum, attic, middle ear, Eustachian tube), surgical techniques used (intact canal wall, canal wall down) and how our habits changed over the years; moreover, we evaluated ossicular chain conditions and how we managed the ossiculoplasty. As outcomes, we considered the percentage of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma for each technique and hearing function (air bone gap closure, high frequencies bone conduction hearing loss) at follow-up. Intact canal wall was performed in 20 patients and canal wall down in 13 patients, in 9 as first surgery. In both groups, we observed improvement of the air bone gap; in the intact canal wall group, a residual cholesteatoma was observed in 6 patients whereas, during follow-up, 2 patients who underwent a canal wall down showed a recurrent cholesteatoma that was treated in an outpatient setting. Eradication of cholesteatoma and restoration of hearing function in paediatric patients present unique surgical challenges. Our experience shows an increased choice of intact canal wall over the years. Therefore, it is important for the surgeon to counsel parents about the probable need for multiple surgeries, especially if an intact canal wall mastoidectomy is performed.

T1  - Audiometric Outcome Comparison between Titanium Prosthesis and Molded Autologous Material
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the audiometric outcomes of ossicular reconstruction with titanium prosthesis and autologous material.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Audiometric results of consecutive patients who performed ossiculoplasty with titanium prosthesis (n = 43) or autologous material (n = 48), from October 2008 to December 2011, were reviewed retrospectively and compared. The association between air-bone gain and age, ossiculoplasty material (autologous or titanium), preoperative diagnosis (chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, cholesteatoma, or conductive hearing loss with intact tympanic membrane), and type of surgery (tympanoplasty, canal wall-down mastoidectomy, or canal wall-up mastoidectomy) was explored using regression analysis.RESULTS: Preoperative audiometric evaluation did not show differences between titanium and autologous groups in air-bone gap and pure-tone average. A postoperative decrease of 11.0 dB in air-bone gap and 12.4 dB in pure-tone average was observed in titanium ossiculoplasty compared with a reduction of 4.0 dB in air-bone gap and 5.1 dB in pure-tone average when autologous reconstruction was used. Mann-Whitney test revealed superior results in the titanium group compared with autologous reconstruction patients in air-bone gap (P = .02) and pure-tone average (P = .02). However, no statistically significant associations were observed after multivariate linear regression analysis of air-bone gap gain when adjusted for age, ossiculoplasty material, type of surgery, and preoperative diagnosis. One titanium prosthesis extrusion occurred during follow-up (2%).CONCLUSION: Audiometric results achieved by titanium prosthesis are promising, but significant differences compared with autologous ossiculoplasty were not present.

T1  - Middle ear gas pressure regulation: the relevance of mastoid obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish a mathematical model of middle ear gas pressure regulation and to discuss potential implications for pathophysiology-oriented theoretical approach to middle ear surgery, with particular attention to mastoid obliteration.BACKGROUND: Numerous studies support that small mastoid volume is associated with cholesteatoma. Latest studies show that mastoid obliteration is an effective technique to lower the recurrence rate in these ears.METHODS: A mathematical model was used to predict the development of gas pressure balance in the function of different middle ear volumes (VME), considering normal and dysfunctional Eustachian tube. Published data as gas pressure input values and our 3D CT reconstruction data in healthy and pathologic middle ears of children were applied.RESULTS: The model predicted <=6.66 daPa pressure fluctuations in VME >=3 ml, compared to >=16 daPa of a VME <=1 ml at perfect ET function, because of the different pressure change rate and pressure buffer effect of the MEs. Substantially larger fluctuations can be expected in a VME <3 ml with malfunctioning ET. Modeling mastoid obliteration predicts similar pressure fluctuations to a VME >=3 ml resulting from elimination of gas exchange surface.CONCLUSION: Pressure change is faster in smaller MEs than in larger ones. Healthy MEs between 3 and 6 ml are very sensitive to the duration of a potential ET dysfunction to develop ME pathology. In MEs with poor mastoid pneumatization and dysfunctional ET, typical in cholesteatoma cases, mastoid obliteration as surgical reduction of mucosal surface for gas exchange can improve ME gas pressure balance resulting in better long-term outcome.

T1  - Acquired middle ear cholesteatoma in children with cleft palate: experience from 18 surgical cases
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review an institutional experience with the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with cleft palate.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 18 children diagnosed with cleft palate who underwent surgery for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma between 2000 and 2007. The following data were recorded: age, sex, history of ventilation tube insertion, status of the contralateral ear, cholesteatoma location and extension, and surgical technique involved. Cholesteatoma recidivism, stable mastoid cavity and hearing levels were the main outcomes measured.RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 5 to 12 years (mean 8 years). Twelve children underwent planned staged canal wall up mastoidectomy: a residual cholesteatoma was found and removed during the second-look procedure in 2 ears (16.6%); two children (16.6%) showed a recurrent cholesteatoma and required conversion to canal wall down mastoidectomy. A modified Bondy technique was chosen in two children with an epitympanic cholesteatoma with an intact tympano-ossicular system, while in the remaining four subjects a canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed because of an irreparable erosion of the postero-superior canal wall: no cases of recurrent cholesteatoma were observed in these 6 children; revision mastoidectomy was needed in one patient for cavity granulation. A postoperative air-bone gap result of 0-20dB was achieved in 11 children (61.1%); in 5 cases (27.7%) postoperative air-bone gap was between 21 and 30dB, while in 2 (11.1%) was >30dB. Bone conduction thresholds remained unaffected in all cases.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that most cleft palate children with cholesteatoma can be managed with a canal wall up mastoidectomy with low complication rates. In extensive disease with large erosion of the canal wall as well in presence of a retraction pocket in the contralateral ear, a canal wall down mastoidectomy should be considered. In epitympanic cholesteatomas with an intact tympano-ossicular system and mesotympanum free of disease, the modified Bondy procedure is an effective surgical option. As in the general pediatric population, improvement or preservation of hearing can be obtained in most patients. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - [Acquired pediatric cholesteatoma: predictive factors of recurrence. A retrospective study of 11 years]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To define the predictive factors of recurrence of the pediatric acquired cholesteatoma in order to improve the long-term results, to restore a good hearing function and to prevent the complications.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study concerning all cases of pediatric acquired cholesteatoma, treated during the period 1997-2008 in our center, and followed up for at least one year. A description of the parameters concerning the patients, disease and treatment as well as a univariate analysis were undertaken in order to determine the recurrence predictors. The recurrence-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: 26 ears were studied and followed over a mean period of 62 months after the first intervention. The mean age was 12 years (11.7 years) with a 2.7 sex-ratio. The main clinical presentations were otorrhea (65%) and hypoacusia in 42% of cases. Fifteen cases (57.7%) presented an extension to the mastoid, 50% of the ears had an ossicular erosion and 11 cholesteatomas revealed a local or regional invasion. Almost 3/4 (73%) of the cholesteatomas were treated using a canal wall up surgery. The cumulative rate of recurrence was 53.8% and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 84%, 56%, and 44.7% at 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Only the extension of the cholesteatoma to the mastoid, and the local and regional invasion (sinus tympani, lateral semi-circular canal, facial nerve recess, etc.) of the cholesteatoma at diagnosis, showed a significant higher risk of recurrence (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: In our study, the extent of the disease at diagnosis is considered as the major predictive factor of recurrence in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma population raising the problem of delayed diagnosis.

T1  - Partial mastoid obliteration combined with soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to analyze the surgical outcomes of tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma.METHODS: Sixty-nine patients (73 ears) with fresh middle ear cholesteatomas, 42 men and 27 women aged 6 to 89 years, were retrospectively analyzed. The cholesteatomas were the pars flaccida and tensa types in 59 and 12 ears, respectively. The patients underwent canal-wall-down tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction. Follow-up computed tomography was performed 6 to 12 months after surgery. Hearing outcomes were evaluated by the arithmetic mean of the hearing levels at 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz.RESULTS: Residual cholesteatoma occurred in 7 ears (9.6%) and recurrent cholesteatoma in 1 ear (1.4%). No cavity problem was seen. Primary evaluation of postoperative hearing was performed 6 to 12 months after ossiculoplasy. Of the 50 ears with available audiogram in this period, the postoperative air-bone gaps were <= 15 dB and <= 20 dB in 27 (54.0%) and 37 (74.0%) ears, respectively. The postoperative hearing level was within 30 dB in 22 ears (44.0%). The hearing gain was >= 15 dB in 24 ears (48.0%).CONCLUSIONS: The surgical outcomes of tympanoplasty with partial mastoid obliteration and soft-wall reconstruction for middle ear cholesteatoma were satisfactory with a low incidence of cholesteatoma recidivism and tolerable postoperative hearing without cavity problems.

T1  - Alternative to canal wall-down mastoidectomy for sclerotic mastoid cavities: epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Surgical procedures for chronic ear disease can be grossly divided into two tympanoplasty procedures: canal wall-up and canal wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomies. The choice depends on the surgeon's preference. Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration (EMO) has shown postoperative results similar to those of CWD mastoidectomy with long-term follow-up. In this study, we compared the outcomes of EMO and CWD mastoidectomy in preoperatively sclerotic mastoid cavities with cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media with poor eustachian tube function, or adhesive otitis media. The operations were performed by the same surgeons in order to eliminate any effect of surgeon preference on the surgical outcomes.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty with EMO (EMO group) or CWD mastoidectomy (CWD group) and followed them for more than 28 months. The postoperative outcomes were analyzed and compared.RESULTS: The EMO and CWD groups comprised 132 and 110 ears, respectively. In both groups, the air-bone gaps were significantly reduced after operation. The relapse rates of the groups were similar. Cavity problems were the most common complication in the CWD group. The overall complication rate in the EMO group was significantly lower than that in the CWD group (p = 0.044).CONCLUSIONS: Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration can be considered an alternative procedure to CWD mastoidectomy in patients with preoperatively sclerotic mastoid cavities. It gives similar surgical results and has fewer complications.

T1  - Minimally invasive functional approach for cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Report the efficacy of a functional minimally invasive approach for cholesteatoma surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of surgical cases performed between 1996 and 2008.METHODS: One hundred sixty-nine patient charts were reviewed in which ears with primary cholesteatomas that extended beyond the mesotympanum were operated on with a plan for canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy. The surgical approach consisted of progressive exposure from transcanal to postauricular tympanoplasty to CWU mastoidectomy, as needed, to identify and lyse the fibrous attachments that bind the capsule to the surrounding mucosa. Endoscopic guidance was employed as appropriate to minimize exposure needs. Any planned second-stage operations were attempted with a transcanal approach if appropriate and with endoscopic assistance.RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four ears of 169 patients were included. The median age was 32 years (range, 1-79 years). The mean follow-up was 3.2 years (range, 1-11 years). Eighty-three (45%) were planned for a second-look operation, and three (2%) required unplanned second operations. The overall recurrence rate was 24/184 (13%), and the unexpected residual rate was 5/184 (3%). The residual rate with endoscopy (5/119, 4%,) or without endoscopy (1/65, 2%), were not significantly different. Hearing results in 156 ears improved significantly, from a preoperative pure-tone average (PTA) of 41 dB to a postoperative PTA average of 29 dB (P < .0001).CONCLUSIONS: A functional minimally invasive approach to cholesteatoma surgery provided equivalent residual rates but higher recurrence rates compared to published canal wall down mastoidectomy. Endoscopic techniques were helpful in providing adequate views while minimizing exposure. Copyright Â© 2014 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

T1  - Predictive value of middle ear aeration before second-stage operation in staged tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction
AB  - CONCLUSION: The extent of middle ear aeration before second-stage canal wall-down (CWD) tympanoplasty was correlated with postoperative middle ear stability.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate middle ear aeration before second-stage CWD tympanoplasty as a predictor of postoperative re-aeration potential and external auditory canal (EAC) stability in staged CWD tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction (SWR).METHODS: Middle ear aeration was evaluated before and at 1 year after the second-stage operation in patients who underwent staged CWD tympanoplasty with SWR for middle ear cholesteatoma. Based on the computed tomography (CT) findings, middle ear aeration was graded as A when the mastoid and tympanic cavities were aerated, B when only the tympanic cavity was aerated, and C in cases with no aeration in the tympanic cavity. We also examined postoperative EAC stability.RESULTS: Forty-one ears were included. In all, 17 of 19 ears (89.5%) with grade A aeration preoperatively maintained grade A aeration postoperatively, while 5 of 18 ears (27.8%) with grade B aeration had grade A aeration, and no ear with grade C aeration had recovered grade A aeration. All ears with grade A aeration preoperatively maintained smooth EACs. EAC retraction requiring additional treatment occurred in five ears with grade B aeration and all ears with grade C aeration.

T1  - Mastoidectomy and mastoid obliteration with autologous bone graft: a quality of life study
AB  - BACKGROUND: A mastoid cavity resulting from a canal wall down mastoidectomy can result in major morbidity for patients due to chronic otorrhea and infection, difficulty with hearing aids and vertigo with temperature changes. Mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of the bony external ear canal recreates the normal anatomy to avoid such morbidity. Few have the studied the quality of life benefit that this procedure confers.METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted to determine if mastoid obliteration with autologous cranial bone graft following mastoidectomy improves quality of life (QOL). Patients with cholesteatoma who had mastoidectomy with primary or secondary mastoid obliteration by a tertiary otologist were surveyed using the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), our primary outcome measure.RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were interviewed. Forty-six were primary obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomy of a primary cholesteatoma. Twelve were secondary obliteration of an existing canal wall down mastoid cavity. Overall GBI scores were improved, with average scores of 22. Average general subscale scores were 23, physical health scores were 25, and social health scores were 22. The primary obliteration group had average scores of 19, general subscale scores of 20, physical health scores of 21, and social health scores of 22. Those with secondary obliteration scored higher, with average scores of 31, general subscale scores of 34, physical health scores of 39, and social health scores of 25.CONCLUSION: This study shows that mastoidectomy with obliteration using autologous cranial bone graft offers a significant QOL benefit. The GBI scores compare favourably with other otorhinolaryngology procedures. Secondary obliterations after revision mastoidectomy scored much higher than primary obliterations. This is currently the only QOL study comparing these two patient groups.

T1  - Management of acquired cholesteatoma in children: a 15 year review in ENT service of CHNU de FANN Dakar
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiology, diagnosis, management and the prognosis of cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 15 years (from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2009) for patients aged 0-15 years admitted in ENT ward of FANN hospital for chronic otitis media complicated with cholesteatoma The parameters studied were epidemiology, clinical presentation, disease progression and management.RESULTS: Sixty-six participants were included. We noted a slight male predominance with a sex ratio of 1.44. The average mean age was 10 years. Most patients presented with signs of complications (69.7%) and mastoiditis was the most common complication (63.6%). The otorrhea was noted in almost all patients: n = 64 (97%) and deafness in 49 patients (74, 2%). There was a slight predominance of cholesteatoma on the right side (51.5%). Schuller's view of the mastoid cells was done in 21.2% of patients (n = 14) and showed sclerotic mastoid air cells for all them. Eighty-two percent (82%) of patients presented with conductive hearing loss. A radical mastoidectomy was performed in 66.7% and modified radical mastoidectomy in 33.3% of cases. Mean follow-up was 6 months. Recurrence of cholesteatoma was noted in 13% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: ENT ward of Hospital Fann is one of the two centers in Senegal where cholesteatoma of the middle ear are treated. This low number of cholesteatoma in children in a developing country is in relation to the fact that patients only present when complications develop: 70% of cases. The reason for this in our setting include insufficient human and manpower resources necessary for prompt management of the disease and also lack of awareness among the populace. In these settings we advocate canal wall down mastoidectomy (radical or modified radical) as the treatment of choice. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Subtotal petrosectomy and mastoid obliteration in adult and pediatric cochlear implant recipients
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of subtotal petrosectomy and mastoid obliteration (SPMO) on the overall success of adult and pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.SETTING: Tertiary care referral center.PATIENTS: Thirty-nine ears in 36 patients (23 adults and 13 children) received both surgeries between 1990 and 2012.INTERVENTION: CI candidates underwent SPMO to permit implantation and minimize the risks of infectious complications in the recipient ear. SPMO was performed before (69.3%), at the time of (25.6%), and after CI (5.13%). Mastoids were obliterated with fat (30.8%), muscle (66.7%), and bone pate (2.56%).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Feasibility, complications, and success of SPMO and CI were assessed with standard statistical analysis and Fisher's exact test with 2-sided p values.RESULTS: Ear disease was definitively managed, and CI was successfully placed in all but one case. Complications including abscess (n = 3), subcutaneous emphysema (n = 1), ear canal granulation formation (n = 1), and electrode extrusion (n = 1) occurred in 15.4% of patients. Predisposing syndromes were present in children more often than adults (43.8% versus 13.0%, p = 0.0598). Adults more often than children had previous mastoid surgery for middle ear disease (30.4% versus 0.0%, p = 0.0288). CIs were placed under local anesthetic and sedation (n= 3) and after radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer (n = 2) in adult ears.CONCLUSION: SPMO is an effective and safe procedure for definitively managing middle ear disease and implanting adult and pediatric CI candidates.

T1  - Use of mastoid obliteration techniques in cholesteatoma
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To evaluate the choice of techniques, safety and long-term outcome of mastoid obliteration and assess the place of imaging in the postoperative monitoring of residual cholesteatoma.RECENT FINDINGS: All recent reports on mastoid obliteration for the management of cholesteatoama were favourable. Long-term follow-up reports did not show problems arising from hidden cholesteatoma, even for the paediatric population. Non-EPI DW MR imaging has shown great promise in detecting residual cholesteatoma in obliterated cavities.SUMMARY: Canal wall down technique with primary mastoid obliteration for cholesteatoma has low recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates. Most ears remained dry and waterproof on long-term follow-up.

T1  - Management of acquired cholesteatoma in the pediatric population
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review focuses on the most recent literature pertaining to pediatric acquired cholesteatoma and aims to integrate findings into a comprehensive management approach.RECENT FINDINGS: Pediatric acquired cholesteatoma has been shown to differ from the adult variety secondary to anatomy and physiologic factors. Whereas the goals of therapeutic management are ultimately similar in adult and pediatric patients, special considerations must be taken into account when deciding on a treatment plan for a child. Although avoidance of an unstable mastoid cavity is an important consideration in this population, successful management has been reported with canal wall-up, canal wall-down, and hybrid techniques. Second-look procedures are also important when concern of recurrence exists. Newer innovations include endoscopic ear surgery and diffusion-weighted imaging.SUMMARY: The principal goal of pediatric cholesteatoma management is eradication of disease. An individualized approach is paramount in yielding superior results in these patients. Special consideration should be given to anatomical and social factors.

T1  - Intraoperative findings of revision canal wall-down tympanomastoid surgery
AB  - CONCLUSION: Chronically discharging mastoid cavities had well-defined technical faults from previous surgery. Identifying and eliminating these errors during revision canal wall-down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy converted troublesome mastoid cavities into safe ears in 84% of cases.OBJECTIVE: To assess intraoperative findings of revision CWD tympanomastoidectomy to determine the most common causes of failure of previous surgery. The short-term results of revision surgery after a 12-month follow-up period were analyzed.METHODS: The study group consisted of 50 consecutive patients, 27 males and 23 females, aged 7-63 years (mean 34 +/- 17 years) undergoing revision CWD tympanomastoidectomy due to persistently discharging mastoid cavities. The outcome of revision surgery was measured semi-quantitatively using a grading system.RESULTS: The most common causes for failure of previous surgery were persistent mastoid cells in the tegmental, sinodural angle, and the retrolabyrinthine, retrofacial, and mastoid tip regions (100%); the bony overhangs at the edges of the mastoid cavity and the high facial ridge (98%); inadequately narrow meatus (84%); recurrent or residual cholesteatoma (46%); and remaining malleus head (40%). Revision surgery included elimination of all encountered limitations followed by mastoid cavity obliteration in about two-thirds of cases. Hearing restoration was done in only 34% of ears. In the remaining cases, intact ossicular chain (6%), existing sufficient previous reconstruction (22%) or impossible situation for reconstruction (38%) was found.

T1  - Outcome of canal wall down mastoidectomy: experience in sixty three cases
AB  - A canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) is an effective technique for eradication of advanced chronic otitis media or cholesteatomas. A retrospective study was conducted at a Malaysian Tertiary Medical Center between June 1996 to December 2003 to evaluate the outcome of Modified Radical Mastoidectomy(MRM), a form of CWDM for patients with chronic active otitis media (OM) with cholesteatoma, chronic mastoiditis or chronic active OM with cholesteatoma and mastoiditis. All new cases of MRM which fulfilled the selection criteria were reviewed. The main outcome measures were the hearing outcome and status of dry ear postoperatively. A total of 84 patients had undergone CWDM. However only 63 patients (26 male, 37 female) were included for analysis. The age of the patients ranged between 5 months to 72 years (mean, 31years). The majority of the patients (86%) were adults and 9 (14%) were children. The ossicular chain was eroded in 91% (57 cases). There were 33 patients (53%) who showed no improvement of Air Bone Gap (ABG) closure while 16 patients (25%) had a post-operative improvement. The presence or absence of stapes suprastructure was found to be the major factor in determining the amount of ABG (Chi squared test, P = 0.025 preoperatively and P = 0.031 postoperatively). A dry ear was achieved in 78% of patients with 3% recurrence rate. In conclusion, the study showed that a proper MRM gave high percentage of dry ear and this procedure did not worsen the hearing.

T1  - Non-echo planar diffusion-weighted MRI increases follow-up accuracy after one-step step canal wall-down obliteration surgery for cholesteatoma
AB  - CONCLUSION: Non-echo planar (non-EPI) diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) increases the number of detected cholesteatoma after one-step canal wall-down (CWD) obliteration surgery for cholesteatoma compared with clinical evaluation alone.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of DW-MRI for detection of cholesteatoma after surgical treatment using a CWD obliteration technique.METHODS: Thirty-eight adult patients (41 ears) treated with an identical one-step CWD obliteration surgical technique were included in a prospective and blinded study. All patients were investigated with non-EPI and EPI DW-MRI 1-9 months after the clinical examination. Follow-up time after primary surgery varied between 10 and 234 months. DW-MRI was assessed by two neuroradiologists and compared with clinical results. Inter-rater agreement was calculated. Positive non-EPI DW-MRI cases underwent revision surgery within 18-159 days after imaging.RESULTS: Seven of 41 cases were evaluated as positive for cholesteatoma on non-EPI DW-MRI. Since one patient refused surgery six of these seven cases underwent surgical revision and all were verified. There was agreement between clinical and non-EPI findings in five of eight cases. EPI findings correlated poorly with non-EPI and clinical findings. Inter-rater agreement (Cohen's kappa) was 0.91 for non-EPI DW-MRI (p < 0.001) and -0.062 for EPI DW-MRI (p = 0.43).

T1  - Tympanoplasty with intact canal wall mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: long-term surgical outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: With different mastoidectomy approaches available to the surgeon for treatment of cholesteatoma, we review long-term outcomes of intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty.STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.SETTING: Academic medical center.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All cases of cholesteatoma treated with ICW mastoidectomy by the senior author over a period of 9 years for which at least 2 years of follow-up data exist. Patient and disease information was collected retrospectively and analyzed.RESULTS: One hundred forty-eight patients with 156 affected ears were treated and followed for a median of 5.3 years (range, 2.1-14.8). The majority of the operations (144/156, 92%) were staged. Of those that were staged, 51/144 (35%) had residual cholesteatoma at the second stage. Thirteen patients (8%) had recurrence of their cholesteatoma, of which 6 required a subsequent canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: ICW mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty continues to be a successful treatment for cholesteatoma. We found a substantial residual rate at the second stage, justifying the necessity of staging in most cases. Recurrence rate of cholesteatoma using this technique is low, as is the progression to CWD mastoidectomy.

T1  - Unique microbiology of chronically unstable canal wall down tympanomastoid cavities: considerations for surgical revision
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the microbiology of open tympanomastoid cavities in patients who underwent revision surgery due to chronic instability.METHODS: This paper describes a retrospective chart review of surgical revision cases of chronically unstable open mastoid cavities. Patient records from 2000 to 2010 were reviewed for the type of organism cultured, antimicrobial resistance and the presence of cholesteatoma.RESULTS: In total, 121 revision surgical procedures were performed on 101 patients. Seventy-nine procedures involved culture specimen processing, 37 of which were positive. The most commonly cultured organism was Staphylococcus aureus, which was more than twice as common as any other pathogen. The presence of cholesteatoma had no impact on the likelihood of a positive culture or polymicrobial culture. Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were uncommon.CONCLUSION: A positive culture was not an overwhelmingly common characteristic of unstable tympanomastoid cavities. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance did not appear to play an essential role in leading patients towards revision open mastoid surgery.

T1  - Complications and treatment of chronic otitis media
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the etiologic factors and treatment types for chronic otitis media (COM) complications.METHODS: In this study, the data from 82 patients who had been diagnosed and treated at the Departments of Otolaryngology and Neurosurgery of Gaziantep University between 1999 and 2011 for complications from COM were retrospectively reviewed. The chosen surgical procedure was based on the type of complication and the ear pathology.RESULTS: The study included 55 male and 27 female patients. Ten patients (12.2%) had intracranial complications, and 72 patients (87.80%) had extracranial complications. There were 47 patients with cholesteatoma. Radical mastoidectomy was performed on 46 patients, canal-wall-down mastoidectomy was performed on 30 patients, and canal-wall-up mastoidectomy was performed on 6 patients. Five patients underwent neurosurgical operations because of COM complications.CONCLUSIONS: Although the rate of COM complications has recently declined, it remains important to diagnose COM without delay and to use appropriate treatments for the patients because COM complications are associated with poor outcomes.

T1  - [Current aspects of paediatric cholesteatomas]
AB  - Cholesteatomas can be subclassified into genuine and acquired forms. Whilst epidermoid formations are the generally accepted cause of genuine cholesteatomas, metaplasia, immigration, proliferation and retraction pocket theories have all been proposed to explain the development of acquired cholesteatomas. Clinically, paediatric cholesteatomas exhibit more extensive and aggressive growth than those arising in adulthood. Molecular biological differences in terms of angiogenesis, cytokine expression and particularly the more marked inflammatory responses of the perimatrix could potentially explain these clinical differences. The surgical therapy of paediatric cholesteatomas should be adapted to the individual pathological findings, although where possible a canal wall up procedure is preferred during initial surgery. The "inside-out" mastoidectomy tracking-technique combines the benefits of a good surgical overview with those of a physiological postoperative auditory canal.

T1  - Surgical technique and recurrence in cholesteatoma: a meta-analysis
AB  - Conflicting reports and surgeon opinions have contributed to a long-standing debate regarding the merits of the intact canal wall versus canal wall down approach to cholesteatoma. The objective of this analysis was to identify and synthesize available data concerning rates of recidivism after the two primary types of cholesteatoma surgery. PubMed, Cochrane Collaboration, and Google Scholar searches were performed and articles filtered based on predetermined exclusion criteria. Individually reported rates of recurrent and residual disease were extracted and recorded. Meta-analysis demonstrated a relative risk of 2.87 with a confidence interval of 2.45-3.37, confirming a significantly increased incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma when using an intact canal wall approach rather than a canal wall down approach. Next, rates of recidivism following the typical two-stage intact canal wall operation were compared with a single-stage canal wall down operation and found to be similar. In conclusion, we advocate that greater consideration should be given to the canal wall down procedure in initial surgical management and identify the need for further exploration of rates of recidivism after staged or second-look procedures.

T1  - Surgical treatment of adult cholesteatoma: long-term follow-up using total reconstruction procedure without staging
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: A total of 330 cases of adult cholesteatoma were operated with canal-wall down (CWD) and total reconstruction procedure (TRP) without staging. Independent of preoperative middle ear conditions, cholesteatoma extent and localization, long-term improvement of hearing with a low incidence of residual and recurrent disease were achieved.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate long-term surgical and hearing results using a well-defined surgical technique without staging in adult cholesteatoma.METHODS: The same CWD surgical technique, including obliteration of the mastoid cavity, reconstruction of the canal wall, and ossiculoplasty with autologous bone, was used by three senior surgeons (1982-2004). Preoperative and postoperative pure tone average (PTA) for air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed and compared 1, 3, and 6 years after surgery. Various prognostic factors with potential influence on long-term hearing outcome were evaluated.RESULTS: Recurrence of AC occurred in 10%, residual disease in 3%. Six years after surgery all patients except one had a dry ear and over 92% of all cases were water resistant. Three patients developed complete deafness. Long-lasting improvement and/or preservation of hearing, with maintenance of PTA-ABG closure in 68% of all cases within 20 dB, were obtained. Sixty-four (19%) ossicular revisions were performed.

T1  - The learning curve in revision cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the results of revision surgery for cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient's records.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: A retrospective study of patients operated for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma during the period 1990-2002 was performed. A total of 758 patients were divided into two groups according to surgical experience, and followed during short-term and long-term period. The cholesteatoma was divided according to location, age of patients, status of auditory ossicles, and bilaterality of disease.INTERVENTIONS: The patients were treated with single canal wall up or wall down, according to the propagation of disease and condition of middle ear. The indications for the reoperations were: recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, resuppuration, and AB gap more than 20 dB.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Type of surgical therapy, localization of cholesteatoma, age of patients, revisions, bilaterality of disease, damage of auditory ossicles and learning curve were analyzed.RESULTS: The number of revision operations was reduced in the second period (from totally 24.3% to 16.4%). Closed technique gave a significantly lower rate of failure. For attic cholesteatoma, adults, bilateral disease, and ossicular damage the rate of revisions was significantly lower with surgical experience.CONCLUSION: Surgical experience was important for reduction of reoperation rate for attic and sinus cholesteatoma, adults, bilateral cholesteatoma, and when closed technique is used.

T1  - [Attic exposure-antrum exclusion as an on demand surgical technique for cholesteatoma]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Attic exposure and antrum exclusion (AE-AE) is an on demand surgical technique for the treatment of cholesteatoma. Several techniques have been described with variable recurrence rates. The aim of the study was to describe this surgical technique and its indications and to analyse long-term outcomes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients were included. They received AE-AE in a tertiary centre and were followed-up from 6 months to 7 years. The surgical technique exposes the attic by drilling the superior wall of the external auditory canal and excludes the antrum and the mastoid cells by closing the aditus with a cartilage graft. It is indicated if the lesion does not go beyond the aditus or, if it does, it is a delimited cholesteatoma not damaging the labyrinth. The patients were followed-up by physical examination and radiology (CT scan and Non-EPI diffusion-weighted MRI since 2009).RESULTS: The recurrence rate of the cholesteatoma was 4.8%. At recurrence, an open canal-wall-down mastoidectomy technique was performed. The rate of otorrhea (2/42 cases), serous otitis (2/42) and other complications was low, so aquatic activities were not contraindicated. The AE-AE did not modify ossicular chain reconstruction with respect to the rest of surgical techniques.CONCLUSIONS: AE-AE is a canal-wall-down technique. Its purpose is to remove the lesion and to reduce the recurrence of cholesteatoma. In addition, it allows the entrance of water and reduces the need for 2(nd) look surgery. Non-EPI diffusion-weighted MRI is a reliable technique for follow-up, especially for the excluded mastoid. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

T1  - Mastoid cavity obliteration: our experience
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A chronic discharging ear has been a challenge for the otologists for centuries. The mainstay of treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery and the surgical treatment of choice is modified radical mastoidectomy. The open mastoidectomy technique has been the mainstay of management of chronic ear disease; however this type of surgery is not without its problem. It results in the formation of a mastoid cavity which has various problems. Mastoid obliteration is done to eliminate the cavity related problems.AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study surgical results of mastoid obliteration, efficacy of different methods of mastoid obliteration, cavity problems and the need of cavity care.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 30 subjects having evidence of attico-antral type of disease in middle ear cleft. The mastoid cavity was obliterated with either cartilage/bone dust/flaps Scientific design-prospective study.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of discharge, debris, giddiness, pain was reduced in obliterated cavities. Healing of cavity was better in obliterated ears. Cavity obliterated with bone dust and flap had better and early epithelialisation as compared to cartilage.

T1  - The role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in cholesteatoma diagnosis and follow-up. Study with the diffusion PROPELLER technique
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The diagnosis of cholesteatoma is based on clinical evaluation and computed tomography. New non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, without intravenous contrast, are capable of differentiating cholesteatoma from inflammatory tissue, cholesterol granuloma and granulation tissues. The technique is very helpful in differential diagnosis of cholesteatoma, mainly after canal wall-up tympanoplasty surgery, to avoid routine second-look surgery in these patients. Congenital cholesteatoma and difficult cases can be detected and correctly diagnosed as well. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diffusion-weighted PROPELLER MRI in cholesteatoma diagnosis.METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 52 patients. Clinical and surgical findings were correlated with diffusion-weighted PROPELLER MRI results.RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 92.85%, 92.30, 92.85 and 92.30%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Diffusion-weighted PROPELLER imaging is an effective technique in cholesteatoma diagnosis. It is capable of detecting lesions larger than 2mm. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Espana, S.L. All rights reserved.

T1  - Contemporary non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging of middle ear cholesteatomas
AB  - Middle ear cholesteatoma is a common inflammatory disease that requires surgery due to potentially serious intracranial complications. Diagnosis of cholesteatoma is mainly clinical, with computed tomography (CT) used to evaluate disease extension before surgery. Certain patterns of bone erosion are specific, but CT attenuation does not allow differentiation from other inflammatory middle ear diseases. With its high tissue discrimination and contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging is valuable in diagnosis of cholesteatomas. Absent enhancement at delayed postcontrast imaging has been used for diagnosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is highly specific due to the high keratin content of cholesteatomas. New non-echo-planar DWI sequences, such as periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction, are superior to conventional echo-planar DWI, since they minimize susceptibility artifacts at the skull base and increase sensitivity for detection of lesions as small as 2 mm. This technique is indicated when clinical diagnosis is difficult and high tissue specificity is necessary, as in congenital, temporal bone, or atypical acquired middle ear cholesteatomas and residual or recurrent disease after surgery. Non-echo-planar DWI has been proposed for screening of postsurgical (residual or recurrent) cholesteatomas, thus obviating many second-look revision surgeries, especially after more conservative canal wall up surgery.

T1  - Patterns of failure in canal wall down mastoidectomy cavity instability
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patterns of failure for canal wall down mastoid cavities requiring surgical revision.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral centerPATIENTS: Adults and children that underwent revision of an unstable open mastoid cavity from 1995 to 2010.INTERVENTION(S): Review of demographic data, tympanomastoid pathology, and plausible risk factors for an unstable cavity. Available computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed for indicators of suboptimal cavity shape. Spearman's correlation analysis was undertaken. Findings were classified as Type 1 (primary tympanomastoid pathology), Type 2 (cavity shape/size), or Type 3 (negative host environment).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Frequency of risk factors and correlation.RESULTS: Approximately 130 cases were reviewed. Stapes erosion (49.2%), absent malleus (26.2%), cholesteatoma (44.6%), tympanic membrane perforation (34.6%), and fibrotic middle ear mucosa (20.8%) were common. CT scans often demonstrated an intact open mastoid tip (87.5%) and a high facial ridge (54.2%). Notable correlations were discovered between the facial ridge height proximally and the height distally (r = 0.46437, p = 0.0256) and tympanic membrane perforation and absent malleus (r = -0.17944, p = 0.0419). Approximately 68% of the subjects had at least 1 Class 1 risk factor present among cholesteatoma, tympanic membrane perforation/atelectasis, and extruded prosthesis. All CT scans reviewed demonstrated at least 1 class 2 factor.CONCLUSION: Although primary tympanomastoid pathology is quite common, some aspect of suboptimal mastoid cavity size and shape is pervasive. Correlation analysis suggests that surgeons tend to either lower the facial ridge completely or not at all and that an absent malleus seems to be associated with a tympanic membrane perforation.

T1  - [Application of the endoscopy in the middle ear surgery]
AB  - Endoscopy is used in the middle ear surgery for above twenty years when decrease of cholesteatoma recurrence due to employing endoscope was revealed in comparison to standard microscopic only visualisation. Endoscopy may be the only way of visualisation in transcanal myringoplasty for the retraction pocket, stapedoplasty and transcanal ossiculoplasty. In canal wall up or second look tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy endoscopy may serve as an additional point of view supported the classical microscopical technique. In result of many manners in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media, there are very concept for endoscopy application. In the ENT Department at Medical University of Warsaw were performed 53 procedures by aid of endoscopy in period from September 2009 to December 2010. In this study there were 18 canal wall up tympanoplasties, 12 second look tympanoplasties and 8 canal wall down tympanoplasties. According to authors' experience endoscopy is the most useful in: There were three cases of cholesteatoma recurrence in the study found only due to endoscope support. In authors' opinion, the endoscopy is the useful tool in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media. Application of endoscopy during the middle ear surgery results in decrease in frequency of cholestatoma recurrence and increase in the effectiveness of the ossiculoplasty.

T1  - Surgical treatment of paediatric cholesteatoma: long-term follow up in comparison with adults
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to analyse long-term results after surgery of acquired (ACH) and congenital cholesteatoma (CCH) of the middle ear in children and compare these with adults.METHODS: Computer-based analysis of consecutively operated paediatric patients for ACH and CCH in a tertiary referral centre was made in 57 cases under the age of 12 operated 1983-2004 by three surgeons using identical technique. A canal wall down and total reconstruction procedure (TRP) with obliteration of the mastoid cavity, canal wall reconstruction, ossiculoplasty with consistent use of autologous bone and an "aeration enhancement procedure" (AEP) with silicon sheet in selected cases were used. Pre- and post-operative PTA (0.5-3 kHz) and pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) together with surgical parameters were assessed 1, 3 and 6 years following surgery.RESULTS: Results showed stable hearing over 6 years with low incidence of persistent and recurrent disease comparable with results from adult patients. In nearly half of the cases, silastic sheeting was used. In 21 cases, stapes was eroded. Bone conduction thresholds levels remained unaffected 6 years after surgery. No deaf ears, postoperative facial dysfunction or other lesions related to surgery were observed. Six years after surgery every evaluated ear was found to be water-resistant and infection -free.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that one-stage eradication of ACH and CCH in children using total reconstruction procedure (TRP) provide long-term improvement or preservation of hearing, with a low incidence of persistent or recurrent disease. No difference in surgical outcome between children and adults was found. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Clinical indications for canal wall-down mastoidectomy in a pediatric population
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish clinically derived indications for performing canal wall-up or canal wall-down surgery when treating children with cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.SETTING: Tertiary care academic pediatric otolaryngology practice.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 420 children who underwent 700 procedures for cholesteatoma between 1996 and 2010.RESULTS: The canal wall was preserved in 89.5% of cases. Common reasons for removing the canal wall were to provide access to the disease, extensive erosion of key structures, and the desire to avoid further surgery. The mean pure-tone average (PTA) for the canal wall-up group was 30 dB, whereas the canal wall-down group had a mean PTA of 45 dB. A matched-pairs analysis demonstrated that the better performance of the canal wall-up group was independent of preoperative hearing levels. Furthermore, although the presence of the stapes did influence hearing results, the canal wall-up procedure yielded better results even when the condition of the stapes was taken into account. The number needed to treat with canal wall-up to prevent 1 case of hearing loss (ie, mean threshold >30 dB) would be around 6. The need for revision surgery was higher in the canal wall-up group (51%) compared with the canal wall-down group (21%).CONCLUSION: In the setting of adequate follow-up and open access to surgical resources, most children with cholesteatoma can be managed with an intact canal wall technique. The authors believe that the better audiometric outcomes and easier postoperative care outweigh the need for revision surgery in this group.

T1  - Acquired cholesteatoma in children: strategies and medium-term results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess paediatric cholesteatoma surgical management strategies, residual disease and recurrence rates and especially the medium-term auditory impact.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 22 cases of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma selected from a series of 77 children under the age of 16 operated for cholesteatoma between 1st January 2000 and 31st December 2003 on the basis of the following criteria: first-line surgical management with postoperative follow-up greater than four years. Surgical strategies, preoperative and postoperative (at 1 year and at the final visit) audiograms and residual disease and recurrence rates were analysed.RESULTS: A canal wall up tympanoplasty was performed in 82% of cases as first-line procedure and a canal wall down tympanoplasty was performed in 32% of cases. Residual cholesteatoma was observed in 9% of cases and recurrent disease was observed in 18% of cases. The mean preoperative hearing loss was 26dB with an air-bone gap of 23dB with values of 26dB and 20dB respectively at the end of follow-up.CONCLUSION: The majority of children were operated by two-stage canal wall up tympanoplasty. Long-term hearing results remained stable and close to preoperative values. The recurrence rate (residual disease and relapse) was low (27%), as reported in the literature. Copyright Â© 2012.

T1  - A technique for concurrent procedure of mastoid obliteration and meatoplasty after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To present a simple technique for concurrent procedure of mastoid obliteration and meatoplasty after canal wall down mastoidectomy, and to assess the efficacy and the surgical results of this technique.METHODS: Retrospective clinical study of a consecutive series of procedures from 2004 to 2008. One hundred thirteen patients undergone canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty and concurrent procedure of mastoid obliteration and meatoplasty that uses an anteriorly based musculoperiosteal flap and a horizontal skin incision on the concha were included. Preoperative diagnoses were classified into cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis media, and chronic suppurative otitis media. The mean duration of follow-up was 38 months, with a range of 12-75 months. We analyzed control of suppuration and creation of a dry mastoid cavity according to the Merchant's grading system for evaluation of the efficacy of this technique, and hearing outcome. We evaluated postoperative complications including development of recurrent or residual cholesteatomas and duration of the mastoid cavity achieving a complete healing.RESULTS: Seventy-two patients had cholesteatoma, whereas 27 patients had adhesive otitis media and 14 patients had chronic suppurative otitis media. Eighty-three percent of all patients, in 86% of patients with cholesteatoma, in 78% of patients with adhesive otitis media, and in 78% of patients with chronic suppurative otitis media were achieved a dry and self-cleaning mastoid and complete control of infection. Duration of the mastoid cavity achieving a dry and self-cleaning mastoid ranged from 4 weeks to 24 weeks and the mean time of the complete epithelialization was 11.1+/-4.6 weeks. The average ABGs were 32.4+/-13.8dB preoperatively and 23+/-13.2dB postoperatively. There were 5 patients with failure of control of infection postoperatively and 3 patients of recidivistic cholesteatoma.CONCLUSION: The efficacy of our technique to make a dry and healthy mastoid cavity after a canal wall down mastoidectomy is satisfactory, and the rate of complication is acceptably low. We believe that our technique could be a convenient method to prevent cavity problems after canal wall down mastoidectomy. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - Mastoidectomy reconstruction of the posterior wall and obliteration (MAPRO): preliminary results
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary results indicate that mastoidectomy by reconstruction of the posterior wall and obliteration (MAPRO) avoided the disadvantages of a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy. MAPRO effectively prevented cholesteatoma recurrence, provided an excellent basis for hearing restoration, and was generally water-safe.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the authors' experience with the MAPRO technique for eradication of cholesteatomas requiring canal-wall-down mastoidectomy.METHODS: The medical files of all the patients who underwent MAPRO for cholesteatoma between 2008 and 2011 at the Sheba Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed.RESULTS: This series included 49 patients (31 children and 18 adults). The index operation was the first procedure for 30 patients and repeat surgery for 19 patients. Eight patients underwent ossiculoplasty. The mean postoperative follow-up was 28 months. Water tolerance and absence of inflammation were achieved in 93.3% of the first-time group and in 73.7% of the repeat group. (Recurrent cholesteatoma was found on the postoperative non-echo planar base diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in six (12.2%) patients: three (10%) in the first-time group and three (15.8%) in the repeat group).

T1  - Synchronous ossiculoplasty with titanium prosthesis during canal wall down surgery for advanced cholesteatoma: anatomical and hearing outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse patients with cholesteatoma undergoing canal wall down mastoidectomy together with ossicular reconstruction with a titanium prosthesis, in order to identify factors associated with hearing outcomes.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 97 cases undergoing single-stage surgical management.METHODS: All patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy. Kurz titanium ossicular prostheses were used for ossicular chain reconstruction. Pre-operative and post-operative air conduction and bone conduction hearing thresholds were obtained at 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz.RESULTS: The mean pure tone average improved from 46.02 +/- 14.54 dB pre-operatively to 29.32 +/- 14.64 dB post-operatively, for both total and partial ossicular replacement prosthesis groups combined. The mean air-bone gap improved from 30.38 +/- 11.12 dB pre-operatively to 15.62 +/- 9.65 dB post-operatively, for both groups combined.CONCLUSION: Reconstruction with a titanium prosthesis offers good functional results when performed during canal wall down surgery for advanced cholesteatoma, as a single-stage procedure.

T1  - [Tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction of ear canal]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction of ear canal for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.METHOD: Seventy-three patients (76 ears) suffering from chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma were treated with canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty. Postauricular myo-periosteal flap was used to the soft-wall reconstruction of ear canal, and the cavityplasty of auricular concha was not performed. The auricular bone prosthesis was made of the autogeneic mastoid cortical bone or residual incus. The postoperative modality and the function of external auditory canal and the postoperative hearing and the postoperative complications were observed.RESULT: The mean dry ear time was (21.1 +/- 3. 1) days after surgery in this study. The postoperative modality of external auditory canal was normal on the whole. The patients were followed up between 6 months and 24 months after surgery. The postoperative average air conduction hearing was improved by (14.5 +/- 6.1) dB HL.CONCLUSION: Tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction of ear canal using the postauricular myo-periosteal flap can recover the modality and function of external auditory canal on the whole, and the cavityplasty of auricular concha is not needed. The postoperative hearing can be improved by this technique satisfactorily.

T1  - A systematic review of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of postoperative cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A systematic review to determine whether the diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging scan can reliably detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma after mastoid surgery.DESIGN: A systematic review.DATA SOURCES: Databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Review were searched for studies published without language restriction from the start of the databases. Additional studies were identified from cited references.SELECTION CRITERIA: Initial search identified 402 publications, of which 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The DW imaging (DWI) scan was used to detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma and subsequent second-look surgery was performed to correlate the findings.REVIEW METHODS: Studies were assessed for their selection of patients for radiologic investigations, imaging parameters, and subsequent surgery. Outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the DWI, and the incidence and size of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Two different modalities of DWI sequences have been described. Eight studies with 225 patients analyzed echo-planar imaging (EPI) and 8 studies with 207 patients described the "non-EPI" scanning techniques. Non-EPI parameters are more reliable in identifying residual or recurrent cholesteatoma with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 91%, 96%, 97%, and 85%, respectively.CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests that non-EPI such as half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo sequences are more reliable in identifying residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. This is a promising radiologic investigation; however, we think further studies are required with more patients and long-term results to establish its place as an alternative to a second-stage surgery after canal wall up surgery.

T1  - [Principles of cholesteatoma surgery]
AB  - As a potentially life-threatening disease, cholesteatoma of the petrous bone generally requires a surgical approach. Surgery aims to produce an ear that is easy to care for and is free of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. Hearing improvement is of secondary importance. Nevertheless the sound conduction system is generally reconstructed as a single-stage procedure. There are various possible methods of dealing with a cholesteatoma: (i) preserving or reconstructing the posterior meatal wall with an aerated mastoid (closed technique) or obliteration of the mastoid completely or partially after removal of the posterior wall (closed technique); and (ii) leaving the cavity open for inspection (open technique). In our opinion any technique where the mastoid is not open for inspection should be called a closed technique. Both techniques have their specific advantages and disadvantages.

T1  - The value of non-echo planar HASTE diffusion-weighted MR imaging in the detection, localisation and prediction of extent of postoperative cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo (HASTE) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the detection, localisation and prediction of extent of cholesteatoma following canal wall up mastoid surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective blinded observational study.SETTING: University affiliated teaching hospital.PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients undergoing second-look surgery after previous canal wall up mastoid surgery for primary acquired cholesteatoma.INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent non-echo planar HASTE diffusion-weighted imaging prior to being offered 'second-look' surgery.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radiological findings were correlated with second-look intra-operative findings in 38 cases with regard to presence, location and maximum dimensions of cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo diffusion-weighted imaging accurately predicted the presence of cholesteatoma in 23 of 28 cases, and it correctly excluded in nine of 10 cases. Five false negatives were caused by keratin pearls of <2 mm and in one case 5 mm. Overall sensitivity and specificity for detection of cholesteatoma were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62-94%) and 90% (CI 55-100%), respectively. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 96% (CI 79-100%) and 64% (CI 35-87%), respectively. Overall accuracy for detection of cholesteatoma was 84% (CI 69-94%). Half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo diffusion-weighted imaging has good performance in localising cholesteatoma to a number of anatomical sub-sites within the middle ear and mastoid (sensitivity ranging from 75% to 88% and specificity ranging from 94% to 100%). There was no statistically significant difference in the size of cholesteatoma detected radiologically and that found during surgery (paired t-test, P = 0.16). However, analysis of size agreement suggests possible radiological underestimation of size when using HASTE diffusion-weighted imaging (mean difference -0.6 mm, CI -5.3 to 4.6 mm).CONCLUSION: Half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo diffusion-weighted imaging performs reasonably well in predicting the presence and location of postoperative cholesteatoma but may miss small foci of disease and may underestimate the true size of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Ossicular chain reconstruction using titanium versus hydroxyapatite implants
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Compare the efficacy of total and partial ossicular chain reconstruction using hydroxyapatite (HA) implants versus titanium (Ti) implants.DESIGN: Case series with chart review.SETTING: Academic tertiary referral center and private practice.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 404 patients underwent ossiculoplasty using either Ti or HA implants from June 1996 to September 2008. Patient data were collected retrospectively from the senior author's electronic database of surgical cases.RESULTS: The change in air-bone gap (DELTAABG) (defined as the difference between the means of preoperative and postoperative ABG) was 9.9 dB for the HA group that received partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP), 9.5 dB for the Ti PORP group, 12.3 dB for the Ti group that received total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (TORP), and 10.0 dB for the HA TORP group. There was no statistically significant difference between the HA and Ti groups. There was no significant difference in hearing results between canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) cases in which mastoidectomy was performed. Four confounding factors (preoperative otorrhea, preoperative perforation, cholesteatoma, mastoidectomy performed) were analyzed using regression analysis. In the Ti PORP group, the presence of cholesteatoma was found to have a significant negative bias for hearing results.CONCLUSION: No statistically significant differences in hearing results were found between the HA and the Ti partial and total ossiculoplasty prostheses. No outcome difference was found between CWU versus CWD mastoidectomy groups for any type of implant used. A randomized, prospective study is necessary for a more definitive comparison of efficacy between HA and Ti OCR implants.

T1  - Surgical management of troublesome mastoid cavities
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the reasons for discharging mastoid cavities, the operative findings during revision surgery, and the medium-term outcome.PATIENTS: One hundred and forty revision mastoidectomies in 131 patients were studied. Post-operatively, patients were followed up at three, six and 12 months and then yearly.INTERVENTION: A variety of techniques were performed. Over 80 per cent of ears were treated with mastoid obliteration. Concomitant hearing restorative procedures were carried out in one-third of the ears.RESULTS: The mastoid cavities were troublesome because of large cavity size, bony overhang, residual infected mastoid cells, the presence of cholesteatoma or perforations, and/or inadequate meatoplasty. One year after revision mastoidectomy, over 95 per cent of the ears had become completely 'dry' and water-resistant. Overall, 50.9 per cent of the ears had a 12-month post-operative air-bone gap of 20 dB or less.CONCLUSION: Revision mastoidectomy has a high success rate in converting troublesome mastoid cavities into dry, water-resistant ears.

T1  - Cholesteatoma imaging using modified echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Imaging of cholesteatomas can be useful especially in cases of recurrent disease. Computed tomography scans have been recommended before primary surgery, but cholesteatoma tissue looks similar to inflammatory tissue. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is both sensitive and specific in detecting cholesteatoma, which appears as a bright signal on a dark background. Non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is superior to routine echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as it minimises susceptibility artefacts; however, the addition of this facility involves expensive magnetic resonance scanner upgrading.METHOD: To avoid the cost of such upgrading, we modified our echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging parameters and then scanned 15 consecutive cases of suspected cholesteatoma or suspected recurrent cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Imaging results correlated well with clinical and/or operative findings.CONCLUSION: These results indicate that software adjustments can enable echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to detect cholesteatomas reliably, and as effectively as non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This discovery has the potential to facilitate reliable delayed post-operative screening of canal wall up mastoidectomies, avoiding the need for a 'second look' procedure.

T1  - Congenital cholesteatoma: delayed diagnosis and its consequences
AB  - This is a retrospective review of congenital cholesteatoma cases that were managed surgically. There were 5 cases. The age of presentation ranged from 5 to 18 year old. Three patients presented with complication of the disease. Three patients had intact tympanic membrane, two had perforation at the anterior superior quadrant. All patients had cholesteatoma medial to tympanic membrane. Four cases had extensive ossicular erosion with preoperative hearing worse than 40 dB. Four cases underwent canal wall down mastoid surgery and one underwent canal wall up surgery. One patient had recurrence which required revision surgery. In conclusion, congenital cholesteatoma presented late due to the silent nature of disease in its early stage. Extensive disease, ossicular destruction with risk of complication at presentation were marked in our study. Hence, more aggressive surgical intervention is recommended in the management of congenital cholesteatoma.

T1  - Congenital cholesteatoma: posterior lesions and the staging system
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We described the characteristics of congenital cholesteatoma in Japanese patients and assessed whether the staging system is useful for predicting the rate of residual disease, the need for reexploration, and surgical outcomes.METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart analysis of 23 consecutive patients with congenital cholesteatoma.RESULTS: The proportion of cases with anterior-superior quadrant involvement was significantly lower in the Asian group than in Western patients. The total residual rate was 26%, and there was a positive association between stage and residual rate, ranging from 0% in stage I and II to 44% in stage IV. Canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy was the most frequent procedure (57%), and 61% had reexploration.CONCLUSIONS: Congenital cholesteatoma in Asia is less likely to involve the anterior-superior quadrant than in Western patients. The 4-stage system was useful for predicting residual rates, even in patients in whom anterior-superior quadrant involvement was less common. Postoperative hearing was significantly related to the stages. A routine second-look procedure may be unnecessary in the early stages, whereas reexploration would be better performed in advanced stages. Endoscopy might reduce residual disease and the need for reexploration in the near future.

T1  - [Results of revision surgery for hearing failure in intact canal wall up tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study assessed the audiometric results of revision surgery in patients on whom previous canal wall up tympanoplasty had been performed for chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, and investigated reasons for hearing improvement failure which required revision surgery.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two patients (49 females, 23 males; mean age 35.4+/-12.9 years; range 11 to 64 years) suffering from chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, who had intact canal wall up tympanoplasty and revision surgery due to bad hearing results between March 2004 and September 2009, were evaluated retrospectively. After evaluation of patients' files, operative and audiological records, findings during the surgery, postoperative follow-up, audiometric results before revision surgery and the results in the last control after revision surgery were analysed.RESULTS: Preoperative mean air-bone gap (ABG) decreased in all patients from 31.2 dB to 19.9 dB after followed up for mean 26.7 months. Air-bone gap values below 20 dB were 67%, below 30 dB were 83%, hearing gain above 10 dB was found to be 58%. Comparision of pre- and postoperative ABG values of the patients revealed statistically significant difference (p<0.001). In addition to hearing loss, the reasons for revision surgery were mucosal disease relapse in 10 patients, graft perforation in 43 patients, otorrhea control in 15 patients. Findings during revision surgery were relapse of mucosal diseases in 15 patients, insufficient mastoidectomy in six patients, problems related to prosthesis in 29 patients, ossicular limitations (brid, hyalen and granulation) in 30 patients, and ossicular necrosis in six patients. The decision for four patients was changed from canal wall up tympanoplasty to canal wall down tympanoplasty. Postoperative total hearing loss developed in one case.CONCLUSION: The most important problem in revision of tympanoplasty patients with hearing loss is related with stabilisation of columella. To get successful hearing results, it is important to control disease and provide a stable and safe continuity between the tympanic membrane and vestibule.

T1  - Single-stage canal wall-down tympanoplasty: long-term results and prognostic factors
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify factors associated with anatomic and functional results of canal wall-down tympanoplasty.METHODS: One hundred eighty-nine primary or relapsing cholesteatomas were consecutively operated on by a single surgeon. Cholesteatoma recurrence rates were evaluated. Predictive values of the patient, disease, and surgical characteristics on cholesteatoma recurrence were estimated. The effect of these variables on keratin pearl development, recurrent otorrhea or granulation tissue formation, and hearing function was tested.RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 8 years (range, 4 to 15 years). The cholesteatoma relapse rate (+/- SE) estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method was 2.1% +/-1.1%. No variables were associated with relapsing disease. The log-rank test showed a significantly higher probability of keratin pearls in male patients (16.7% versus 2.1%; p = 0.001), young patients (less than 16 years; 51.4% versus 6.2%; p = 0.0001), patients with unencapsulated cholesteatomas (19.5% versus 5.3%; p = 0.06), patients with petrous or accessory cellularity invasion (17.9% versus 7.1%; p = 0.02), and patients with overlay myringoplasty (25% versus 7.9%; p = 0.03). Recurrent otorrhea and granulation tissue were associated with homograft temporalis fascia myringoplasty (14.3% versus 3.8%; p = 0.04). The overall postoperative air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 30.7%; it was within 20 dB in 43.9% (47/107) for intact or reconstructed ossicular chains and in 13.4% (11/82) for nonreconstructed, eroded ossicular chains (p = 0.0001). The air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 42.6% (46/108) when the mucosa of the tympanic cavity was normal and in 14.8% (12/81) when there was granulation tissue within the tympanic cavity (p = 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage canal wall-down tympanoplasty is an appropriate treatment for acquired tympanomastoid cholesteatoma.

T1  - Immune cell profile in invasive cholesteatomas: preliminary findings
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholesteatoma consists of keratinizing squamous epithelium, granulation tissue and keratin plugs. The pathogenesis of cholesteatoma may be related to alterations in the stromal immune cell infiltrate.OBJECTIVE: To examine the immunophenotypic characteristics of the immune cell infiltrate in invasive cholesteatomas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 12 patients with invasive cholesteatomas causing wide bone erosion of the mastoid, middle ear structures, and the bony plates of middle ear cleft. Diagnosis of invasiveness was based on the clinical, radiological and intraoperative findings. Canal wall-down surgical approach was done in all cases to control the disease process. We used the cholesteatomatous tissue specimens to perform immunohistochemical stains for B cells (CD20), T cells (CD3), histiocytes (CD68) and Langerhans' cells (CD1a). Mouse monoclonal antibodies and immunoperoxidase staining methods were used. The results of immunohistology were scored as mean values of positively stained immune cells. The data were compared with findings in 10 specimens of external ear skin (control group).RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed highly significant (p<0.00) counts of immune cells in invasive cholesteatomas (CD3: 4.7+/-0.4, CD68:4.6+/-0.5, CD20: 0.8+/-0.1 and CD1a: 0.8 +/-0.1) compared to those in external canal skin (control group: CD3:0.8+/-0.3, CD68: 1.0+/-0.4, CD20: 0.2+/-0.1 and CD1a: 0.1+/-0.1). In cholesteatomas, the predominant of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and CD68(+) cells (histiocytes). Rare CD20(+) cells and CD1a(+) cells (Langerhans' cells) were also observed.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study describes the profile of the immune cell infiltrate in invasive cholesteatomas. The numeric dominance of CD3(+) cells and CD68(+) cells suggests that cell-mediated immunity has important role in the development of cholesteatoma and in its autodestructive properties. Further studies are recommended to categorize the T cell subsets in different stages of cholesteatomas. Copyright 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Type III tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis: anatomic and functional results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate anatomical and functional results using titanium prostheses in cartilage palisade tympanoplasties.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. Data were collected from patients' charts and clinical review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.INTERVENTION: Cartilage tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis after tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy in patients operated on between July 1998 and February 2006.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomical results (closure of the perforation, rate of retraction pockets, recurrent cholesteatoma, and extrusion and re-perforation rates) were clinically evaluated. Pure-tone averages of air and bone conduction were analyzed. A postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) of 20 dB or less was taken to represent successful hearing.The hearing outcomes of canal wall up (CWU), canal wall down (CWD), primary and revision surgeries, and 2 groups of a short-term (<12 mo) or long-term (>24 mo) follow-up (f-u) were assessed and compared.RESULTS: Ninety-four cases were observed during the visiting period: 43 (45.7%) underwent primary procedures and 51 (54.3%) underwent revision surgeries. Closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 98.9%.Postoperative ABG was 20 dB or lower in 62 (66%) of 93 cases, between 11 and 20 dB in 33 cases (35%), and 10 dB or lower in 29 cases (31%).All cases undergoing CWU had a mean +/- SD postoperative ABG of 14.59 +/- 11.28 dB. There were no statistically significant differences (independent-samples t test, p = 0.5) between these patients and those receiving CWD surgery (15.95 +/- 10 dB).Thirty-eight (68%) of 56 CWD and 24 (64%) of 37 CWU cases achieved a postoperative ABG between 0 and 20 dB (chi = 0.08, p = 0.7, correlation = 0.031).Thirty-three (64.7%) of 51 who underwent revision surgeries and 29 (69%) of 42 who underwent primary procedures had a postoperative ABG between 0 and 20 dB. The difference between the groups was not significant (chi = 0.3, correlation = 0.058, p = 0.5).The mean ABG in the short f-u group was 12.38 +/- 7.34. There was no significant difference regarding long-term f-u after 24 months (11.76 +/- 8.9; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.7).We compared the mean postoperative ABG in low hearing frequencies (500 and 1,000 Hz) and high hearing frequencies (2,000 and 4,000 Hz). A better sound transmission was achieved in high frequencies (10.32 +/- 10.6 versus 20.61 +/- 13.73 dB, respectively); the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001, paired-samples t test).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis reconstruction offers a stable improvement of the ABG less than 20 dB in 66% of cases, in both short-term and long-term f-u. There were no differences in the results between CWU and CWD or between primary and revision surgery. The titanium prosthesis achieves the best acoustical results for sound transmission at high frequencies (2,000 and 4,000 Hz).

T1  - Type 2 ossiculoplasty: prognostic determination of hearing results by middle ear risk index
AB  - PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to investigate the prognostic impact of middle ear risk index on the postoperative hearing results in cases with type 2 ossiculoplasty; to compare the middle ear risk index results among primary, staged, and revision cases; and to compare the results of the prostheses used in ossicular reconstruction.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records of 293 patients who had canal wall up tympanomasteidectomy and type 2 ossiculoplasty due to chronic otitis media between November 1995 and November 2007 were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: The mean preoperative air-bone gap was 32.6 dB, and it decreased to 15.2 dB after a mean follow-up period of 26.8 months postoperatively. The mean change of air-bone gap was 17.4 dB. Postoperative air-bone gap was 20 dB or less in 79% of the cases. The patients with dry perforations were in the low-risk group, and 91% of them had an air-bone gap of 20 dB or less. This value was 86% in the ones with intact malleus. The patients who had primary surgery were found in moderate risk group, whereas staged and revision groups were in the high-risk group. The air-bone gap was 20 dB or less in 84%, 78%, and 59%, respectively, of those groups. The difference between the primary and the revision groups reached a statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: We had the best ossicular reconstruction results with glass ionomer cement, whereas the worst results were obtained with allograft partial ossicular replacement prostheses. We determined that risk-reducing factors such as dry ear, minimal ossicular chain defect, and intact malleus were important to have successful results. The middle ear risk index is a valuable tool for the surgeon to judge the risks and the probability success of the procedure as well as to make a good patient selection. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Malleus handle: determinant of success in ossiculoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to identify prognostic factors affecting outcome in ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR).STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study is a retrospective case series of electronic database at an academic institution.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed 209 cases of chronic supportive otitis media performed from January 2000 through December 2007 and collected demographic, clinical, audiologic, and outcome information. Univariate analyses of group differences in terms of postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) changes were evaluated by analysis of variance. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between postoperative ABG and the independent variables.RESULTS: There were 105 cases of OCR the met the inclusion criteria (44 primary and 61 revision tympanoplasties), with an average follow-up of 19 months. The diagnoses were chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in 36 cases and cholesteatoma in 69 cases. The mean preoperative ABG was 34 +/- 15 dB, and the mean postoperative ABG was 20 +/- 14 dB (P < 0.001). Of the independent variables analyzed, the type of procedure (ie, OCR performed during second-look tympanoplasty vs canal wall up vs canal wall down), preoperative ABG, and status of malleus handle were predictive of the success of OCR.CONCLUSIONS: Favorable prognostic factors in OCR include smaller preoperative ABG and the presence of an intact malleus handle.

T1  - Rehabilitation of canal wall down mastoidectomy using a titanium ear canal implant
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the rehabilitation of canal wall down mastoidectomy cavities using a custom-made titanium wall implant and to analyze the benefits and the long-term functional results.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.SETTING: Tertiary care center.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have reviewed the data of 113 consecutive operated ears from 106 patients during a 9-year period (1993-2002). The following preoperative and postoperative criteria were compared: the persistence or resolution of otorrhea, cholesteatoma, and vertigo; external auditory canal healing, position of the titanium prosthesis, and tympanic membrane findings. In addition, the hearing status was evaluated by comparing the preoperative data with the 6-month and last follow-up postoperative data to deduce the air-bone gap (ABG) and the auditory gains.RESULTS: Operated ears (88.5%) were dry after the initial rehabilitation, and 97.3% were dry after a revision surgery for defective canal healing. Most patients (96.5%) were free of vertigo. The external auditory canal wall was in a good position in all cases and allowed for a primary skin healing process in 84% of cases; the remaining patients underwent revision surgery under local anesthesia to complete the healing. The reconstructed drum was stable and anatomic in 73% of the cases (n = 83) after the first surgery. Thirty-six patients (32%) underwent various revision procedures: aeration tube placement for 16 patients with mesotympanic retraction and/or serous effusion, revision surgery for 12 patients with attic retraction or evidence of cholesteatoma, and revision for 5 patients with perforation. At last follow-up, 100% of the ear canals were healed, and 85% of patients had a normal tympanic membrane. No residual cholesteatoma was found at last follow-up. Thirty-six percent of patients had an ABG within 20 dB at last follow-up, and 69% within 30 dB.CONCLUSION: The rehabilitation of canal wall down mastoidectomies improves the quality of life of patients regarding cholesteatoma recurrence, otorrhea, and vertigo in more than 95% of cases and stabilizes the hearing loss to less than 30 dB of ABG for more than two thirds of patients. The main unresolved problem is the persistent dysfunction of the middle ear cavity, with unsatisfactory auditory improvements. Middle ear implants represent in selected cases a new solution to rehabilitate the refractory hearing losses.

T1  - Long-term follow up after bony mastoid and epitympanic obliteration: radiological findings
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The canal wall up bony obliteration technique lowers the incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, but carries the potential risk of obliterating residual cholesteatoma. The objective of this study was to report long-term follow-up radiological findings after performing a canal wall up bony obliteration technique procedure, in order to detect residual and/or recurrent cholesteatoma.PATIENTS: Fifty-one patients presenting with a cholesteatoma or a troublesome cavity were operated upon using the canal wall up bony obliteration technique, and were evaluated by follow-up imaging a mean of 76.4 months post-operatively (range, 53.8-113.6 months).INTERVENTION: All patients were evaluated with high resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (including delayed contrast, T1-weighted imaging and non-echo-planar, diffusion-weighted imaging).RESULTS: Imaging revealed the presence of one residual, one recurrent and one congenital petrosal apex cholesteatoma. On high resolution computed tomography, completely obliterated mastoid filled with bone was observed in 74.5 per cent (38/51) of patients, and an aerated middle-ear cavity in 64.7 per cent (33/51). High resolution computed tomography clearly detected any associated soft tissue present in the middle-ear cavity (18/51) and in the obliterated mastoids (13/51), but could not characterise this tissue. Non-echo-planar, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging clearly identified all three cholesteatomas, and differentiated them from other associated soft tissues. No cholesteatoma was found within the obliterated mastoids.CONCLUSION: Long-term follow up indicated that the canal wall up bony obliteration technique is a safe method with which to treat primary and recurrent cholesteatoma and to reconstruct unstable cavities. Soft tissue was found quite often in the middle ear and obliterated mastoids. High resolution computed tomography identified its presence but could not further characterise it. However, non-echo-planar, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging succeeded in differentiating soft tissues, enabling detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma after a canal wall up bony obliteration technique procedure.

T1  - Canal wall-down mastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration for pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: As cholesteatoma is widespread and erosive, it should be cleared away thoroughly, to keep a dry ear and conserve maximum hearing ability in children. Canal wall-down mastoidectomy with mastoid and epitympanum obliteration is a good choice for treatment of cholesteatoma in children.OBJECTIVE: To investigate canal wall-down mastoidectomy with mastoid and epitympanum obliteration for the treatment of cholesteatoma in children.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric middle ear cholesteatoma in children aged 5-12 years between 1999 and 2006 was conducted in Anhui Provincial Hospital. The follow-up information was completed. Forty-five patients (48 ears) were treated with canal wall-down mastoidectomy with mastoid and epitympanum obliteration and followed up for 2-5 years (mean 3.1 years).RESULTS: The recurrence rate and residual rate were 4.16% and 0%, respectively. All ears were dry within 8-10 weeks. Aural discharge was detected in two cases and controlled with antibiotic ear drops without complications. The dry ear rate was 95.8%. The air-bone gap closure had a mean of 17.2 +/- 2 dB. No obvious complication occurred after operations.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media: characteristics and outcomes in comparison with primary surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the characteristics and outcomes of revision surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) with or without cholesteatoma, and to compare with those of primary surgery.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on 208 patients who underwent revision surgery for COM over an 8-year period (1997-2004) and 51 patients who underwent a primary canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM), and were followed for more than 12 months.RESULTS: Recurrent or residual cholesteatoma was found in 49.5% of cases. The mastoid tip and perisinal air cells were the most frequent sites of residual air cells. As a result of revision surgery, a dry and safe ear was achieved in 88.5% of patients. A residual air-bone gap (ABG) of <or=30 dB was achieved in 70.1% of cases with a revision CWDM with ossiculoplasty. In comparison with 51 patients who underwent primary CWDM, the disease control rate was not different. However, postoperative hearing result after ossiculoplasty was worse and longer healing time was required after revision surgery.CONCLUSION: The characteristics and surgical outcome of recurrent COM must be fully understood for complete control of the disease.

T1  - Contemporary assessment and management of congenital cholesteatoma
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Only 2-4% of cholesteatomas presenting to pediatric otologists are congenital in origin. Disease severity can range from intratympanic pearls to middle ear and mastoid obliteration. Recently, highlighted variations of this rare disorder warrant a systematic approach to disease assessment and surgical decision making. This review provides a comprehensive method to diagnose and manage congenital cholesteatoma based on current literature.RECENT FINDINGS: The holding theory of the origin of congenital cholesteatomas is that they arise from retained epithelial cell rest. Primary development can vary among sites within the middle ear and mastoid. 'Open' and 'closed' varieties have been proposed. However, disease severity depends on location, patient age, ossicular integrity, and number of anatomic sites involved. These variables have inspired the development of staging systems whereby appropriate surgical approaches can be designed. Computed tomography (CT) scans are necessary and continue to be the best radiographic tool for surgical planning. Over 30% of congenital cholesteatomas can be extirpated through a transcanal approach. Involvement of the posterior quadrant, over three anatomic subsites, or the mastoid cavity obligates standard canal wall-up techniques. Canal wall-down procedures are rarely required.SUMMARY: Congenital cholesteatomas frequently extend beyond the typically described anterosuperior location of the middle ear. Ossicular destruction, mastoid infiltration, and tympanic membrane rupture are encountered more frequently than previously thought. Advanced disease predominately occurs in older children and requires sophisticated assessment and surgical planning beyond removing a simple keratin cyst. [References: 33]

T1  - Total mastoid obliteration in staged canal-up tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma facilitates tympanic aeration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess middle ear aeration after total mastoid obliteration using bone pate and hydroxyapatite performed at the second stage of intact-canal-wall (ICW) tympanoplasty.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital.PATIENTS: Forty-two ears with cholesteatoma underwent the obliteration. Computed tomography (CT) scan 1 week before the second-stage operation showed disturbance of middle ear aeration.In the 27 ears of these cases, temporal bone CT scans taken 3 years or more after the operation were available.INTERVENTION: We performed second-stage ICW tympanoplasty 1 year after the first-stage canal-up operation. After mastoidectomy and ossiculoplasty, communication between the tympanic cavity and antrum was blocked with cartilage flaps, and the antrum and mastoid cavity were obliterated totally with bone pate alone or combined with hydroxyapatite granules.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Otomicroscopic and otoendoscopic assessment for ear drum retraction was graded. Tympanic aeration assessed with CT when available.RESULTS: After the total mastoid obliteration in the second-stage ICW tympanoplasty, no postoperative complications nor residual cholesteatoma were encountered. The incidence of ear drum retraction was significantly correlated with the grade of tympanic aeration.CONCLUSION: The total mastoid obliteration done at the second-stage ICW tympanoplasty is a safe procedure that facilitates aeration of the tympanic cavity. In ears with restored tympanic aeration, the probability of a retraction pocket development is low. On the contrary, possibility of retraction pocket development is high in the ears with poor tympanic aeration after the second-stage operation.

T1  - Single stage, transmastoid approach for otogenic intracranial abscess
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment of intracranial abscess of otogenic origin, and to study the outcome measures of single stage treatment of the otogenic focus and drainage of intracranial abscess via a transmastoid approach.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: Dr Balabhai Nanavati Hospital and Medical Research Centre, Mumbai, India, an academic tertiary referral centre, and Shri H Bhagwati Municipal General Hospital, Mumbai, India, an academic secondary referral centre.PATIENTS: Seventy-three patients with intracranial abscess secondary to otogenic pathology, confirmed by computed tomographic scanning.INTERVENTION: Single stage treatment of the ear pathology and drainage of intracranial abscess via a transmastoid approach, performed by the senior author (KPM).RESULTS: Of the 73 patients, 12 were lost to follow up and were excluded from the study. Outcomes for the remaining 61 patients were known, and these patients were followed up for at least two years. Adults were more commonly affected by otogenic intracranial abscess than children, with a male preponderance. Otogenic intracranial abscess was associated with both cholesteatomatous (41 per cent) and non-cholesteatomatous ears (59 per cent). All cases were treated with transmastoid drainage of the intracranial abscess and canal wall up or down tympanomastoidectomy, depending on the ear pathology. Two cases developed post-operative cerebrospinal fluid leakage (3 per cent), and another two cases developed meningitis (3 per cent). Five patients had recurrent abscess; two of these patients (3 per cent) died but were included in the study. Three patients had residual abscess, improved with additional management.CONCLUSION: In this series, the low morbidity and mortality rate, combined with a shorter hospital stay, suggest that single stage, transmastoid drainage of intracranial abscess and concurrent treatment of the otogenic pathology is an effective treatment for otogenic intracranial abscess.

T1  - Surgical management of cholesteatoma: the two main options and the third way--atticotomy/limited mastoidectomy
AB  - Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma is considered an "unsafe" ear and generally requires surgical management. This is particularly challenging in children due to anatomical, pathophysiological and social reasons. There are different approaches for this objective. The two main options are the canal wall up and canal wall down mastoidectomy. The aim of this article is to compare the advantages and disadvantages of canal wall up and canal wall down method and present the third way of surgical management: the inside-outside approach through an endaural incision. This technique includes atticotomy, atticoantrostomy or mastoidectomy (mostly very limited) according to the size and location of the cholesteatoma. This technique contributes to the successful surgical management of cholesteatoma, eradicating the disease with the creation of small, dry, self-cleaning cavities and no pinna protrusion. Moreover, there is no need for meatoplasty or obliteration. However, we should never forget that in ear surgery the choice of the operative procedure should take into account the needs of the patient, the extent of the disease, and the surgeon's experience.

T1  - Results of primary ossiculoplasty in ears with an intact stapes superstructure and malleus handle: inflammation in the middle ear at the time of surgery does not affect hearing outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether any factors are predictive of success or failure in primary ossiculoplasty employing autologous bone in Austin-Kartush Group A (stapes and malleus handle present) ears.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single-surgeon case series.SETTING: Two District General Hospitals in the United Kingdom.PATIENTS: Of 135 patients undergoing primary repair, 116 had sufficient data for analysis (mean follow-up 33 months).MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Postoperative air-bone gaps (pABG) in patients with differing qualities of middle-ear mucosa (active versus inactive), differing pathologies (mucosal versus squamous) and differing surgical procedures [canal-wall up (CWU) versus canal-wall down (CWD)].SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: 'Belfast Rule of Thumb' (operated ear hearing brought to 30 dB or better or to within 15 dB of contralateral ear).RESULTS: Postoperative ABGs were closed within 10 dB in 37%, 20 dB in 74% at latest follow-up. The only significant factors predicting hearing outcomes were the status of the canal wall (CWU = 14.1 dB, CWD = 24.7 dB: significant, P = 0.00) and whether surgery was primary or revision. Mean ABG was 14.7 for inactive middle ear mucosa, 17.2 for active middle ear mucosa (not significant, P = 0.25). Excluding CWD procedures from the analysis improved outcomes to 80% (within 20 dB) and 41% (within 10 dB) overall, and the mean for active and inactive ears to 14.2 and 14.0 dB respectively. Postoperatively, 82% of patients fulfilled the 'Belfast Rule of Thumb'.CONCLUSION: The most significant prognostic factor affecting hearing outcomes - status of the canal wall - is independent of staging. The factor most associated with staging - the status of the middle ear mucosa - is only weakly associated with a successful functional outcome.

T1  - Effects of smoking on otologic surgery outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine whether smokers and former smokers have different outcomes of otologic surgery compared to nonsmokers. Smokers have been shown to have worse outcomes in other surgeries, including facial plastics procedures, and it is hypothesized that they will have worse outcomes after ear surgery. Former smokers benefit from reduced risk of heart disease and lung disease after quitting for a period of time. It is also hypothesized that former smokers' risk of ear disease will be reduced over time.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review.METHODS: All patients undergoing otologic surgery are included in this study. Smoking status of all patients was determined and patients are classified as nonsmokers, current smokers, and former smokers. Final hearing is determined after a minimum 12 months follow-up. The rates of complications, subsequent surgery, extent of disease, and canal wall status were measured and compared between smokers and nonsmokers, and smokers and former smokers. The former smoker group was further divided into those that quit <5 years and those that quit >5 years. These groups were compared to nonsmokers.RESULTS: A total of 1,531 surgeries were performed on 1,183 patients. Sixty-three percent of the population were nonsmokers, 21% of patients were current smokers, 5% were former smokers, and 11% unknown. Smokers had more cholesteatomas and required more canal wall down surgeries than nonsmokers. Smokers had a significantly higher incidence of ossicular chain involvement with cholesteatoma or discontinuity requiring reconstructions. They required more revision surgeries, and had overall worse final hearing than nonsmokers. Former smokers, regardless of how long they had quit, had significantly more ossicular chain reconstructions than nonsmokers. Former smokers who quit smoking <5 years had results similar to current smokers. Those former smokers who quit >5 years had results similar to nonsmokers.CONCLUSIONS: Smokers have significantly worse chronic ear disease than nonsmokers. Surgery in smokers is more extensive and leads to worse hearing outcomes than nonsmokers. Subsequent surgeries are more common in smokers. Former smokers who quit <5 years are similar to current smokers, whereas those who quit >5 years were similar to nonsmokers.

T1  - Postauricular approach atticotomy: a modified closed technique with reconstruction of the scutum with cymbal cartilage
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the results of postauricular approach atticotomy in patients with cholesteatoma of the anterior epitympanum.METHODS: Twenty-six patients were selected for removal of cholesteatoma of the anterior epitympanum by postauricular approach atticotomy, a closed transcanal procedure that is used to expose and remove cholesteatoma. After removal of cholesteatoma, reconstruction of the scutum is performed with cymbal cartilage.RESULTS: Postauricular approach atticotomy can be performed as part of a canal wall-up procedure in selected cases in which cholesteatoma invades the anterior epitympanum. Especially if the ossicular chain is intact and if there is an anteriorly curved medial outer canal wall, this technique is useful in avoiding an open technique. A second-look procedure is recommended because of a relatively high percentage of recurrent and residual disease.CONCLUSIONS: Postauricular approach atticotomy with reconstruction of the scutum is a useful technique to remove cholesteatoma from the anterior epitympanum.

T1  - Postoperative aeration in the middle ear and hearing outcome after canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction for cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Canal wall down (CWD) tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction (SWR) is a unique technique for cholesteatoma surgery. The external auditory canal shape after surgery-retracted like a radical mastoid cavity or preserved intact-depends on postoperative aeration in the mastoid cavity. However, the relationship between postoperative middle ear aeration and hearing outcome with this procedure is unknown. We characterized this relationship and propose an ideal state of middle ear aeration to obtain satisfactory postoperative hearing after CWD tympanoplasty with SWR.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.PATIENTS: Seventy-eight patients (78 ears) with fresh cholesteatomas treated surgically at our hospital by planned 2-stage CWD tympanoplasty and SWR were included.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative middle ear aeration was scored 1 year after second-stage surgery by computed tomography. The patients were divided into 4 bins according to postoperative audiometric air-bone (A-B) gaps: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and greater than 30 dB.RESULTS: Postoperative middle ear aeration was significantly greater in the smaller gap bins (0-10 and 11-20 dB) compared with the larger A-B gap bins (21-30 and >30 dB). In contrast to the larger A-B gap bins, those with smaller A-B gaps showed reaeration of the antrum and mastoid cavity. No significant differences were observed in postoperative middle ear aeration or hearing outcome between the 2 cholesteatoma types.CONCLUSION: Promoting postoperative aeration of the entire middle ear is necessary to achieve better hearing outcome in patients undergoing CWD tympanoplasty and SWR for cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma secondary to temporal bone involvement by Langerhans cell histiocytosis: a complication amenable to curative surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe secondary acquired cholesteatoma in patients previously treated for Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). To focus on misleading symptoms suggesting LCH relapse.PATIENTS: This study involved 3 patients aged 12, 20, and 58 months whose conditions were diagnosed with LCH. All 3 had involvement of the mastoid and of the skin of the external ear canal (EAC) at diagnosis. They were treated with steroids and vinblastine.INTERVENTIONS: Serial computed tomographic (CT) scans and clinical follow-up.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Exploratory surgery of the mastoid.RESULTS: Otorrhea recurred in all 3 patients at 24, 17, and 26 months, respectively, with difficulties to clinically identify a hole in the posterior part of the EAC. The otorrhea was considered a sign of a new occurrence of LCH, leading to systemic chemotherapy in 2 cases. A CT scan showed a defect in the posterior wall of the EAC and suggested cholesteatomatous invasion of the mastoid (2 true cholesteatomas and 1 precholesteatomatous case).Surgery (canal wall up mastoidectomies) successfully removed the cholesteatoma (bilateral in 2 cases) and reconstructed the bony defect using cartilage. Biopsies ruled out LCH recurrence.CONCLUSION: Secondary acquired cholesteatoma (through a bony defect of the EAC) may occur in patients previously treated for LCH. Recurrence of symptoms and bone destruction on CT may wrongly suggest LCH recurrence. Surgery allows removal of the cholesteatoma as well as EAC reconstruction and control biopsy.

T1  - Eustachian tube function and habitual sniffing in middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of habitual sniffing and the function of eustachian tube in middle ear cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.SETTING: University hospital.PATIENTS: One hundred thirteen consecutive cases of primary acquired cholesteatoma were operated on from July 2005 to December 2007, and they consisted of 78 pars flaccida type (69.9%), 25 pars tensa type (22.1%), and 10 unclassified large type (8.8%). As a comparison, 178 consecutive cases of chronic otitis media (COM) and 30 consecutive cases of otosclerosis were also examined.METHODS: A questionnaire was administered regarding symptoms of patulous tube and habitual sniffing to alleviate ear symptoms. Eustachian tube function was examined by sonotubometry.RESULTS: The eustachian tube function in cholesteatoma showed patulous type (25.7%), stenotic type (44.2%), and normal type (30.1%), whereas that in COM showed 11.2%, 25.3%, and 63.5%, respectively, and that in otosclerosis showed 6.7%, 16.6%, and 76.7%, respectively. The incidence of patulous type is significantly higher in cholesteatoma than in COM (p < 0.01) and in otosclerosis (p < 0.05). Habitual sniffing was found to be significantly higher in cholesteatoma (31/113, 27.4%) than in COM (9/178, 5.1%) (p < 0.001) and in otosclerosis (1/30, 3.3%) (p < 0.001). The existence of diseases on the contralateral side was significantly higher in cases with habitual sniffing (26/31, 83.9%) than in those without habitual sniffing (32/82, 39.0%) (p < 0.001). After the canal wall up method, postoperative retraction of the eardrum is significantly related to habitual sniffing continuing after the surgery.CONCLUSION: Patulous eustachian tube and habitual sniffing may play a role for pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - Incidence of fallopian canal dehiscence at surgery for chronic otitis media
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence and locations of dehiscence of the fallopian canal (FC) in patients undergoing surgery for different middle ear pathologies and to describe the findings that will aid in pre-operative prediction of dehiscence. Charts and operative details of the 118 ears managed with canal wall-down and 147 ears managed with canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy performed by a single surgeon were retrospectively reviewed. The distribution of the diagnoses for ears that were operated was as follows: 118 ears cholesteatoma, 42 ears adhesive otitis, 23 ears tympanosclerosis, and 82 ears chronic otitis media. The presence and the location of facial nerve dehiscence after exenteration of the disease as well as the presence of any coexisting inner ear fistula and dural defect were noted. FC dehiscence was observed in 56 of the cases. The incidence of dehiscence was highest among ears with cholesteatoma (n = 44, P < 0.05). Adults and also male patients in the study had significantly higher incidence of dehiscence compared to pediatric (P < 0.05) and female (P < 0.01) patients. The most common location for dehiscence was the tympanic segment which was significantly higher than the other locations (P < 0.01). Among the ears with FC dehiscence, labyrinthine fistula presence was seen in ten ears which was also significant (P < 0.001). Patients with dural exposure were 12.06 times more likely to have FC dehiscence than those without dural exposure. The incidence of FC dehiscence was 1.26 times higher in revision operations, but the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). An otologic surgeon should be more careful while performing operation for cholesteatoma in an adult and male patient because of the high incidence of dehiscence observed in these ears. Presence of lateral semicircular canal fistula and erosion of the bony tegmen should also be considered as a clue for the presence of dehiscence before surgery. Operation of these ears should be performed by experienced surgeons in otology.

T1  - Cartilage-wire-fascia compact total ossicular replacement prosthesis in one-stage cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - PURPOSE: Retraction pocket and extrusion of the ossicular prosthesis remain significant problems after tympanoplasty in cholesteatoma surgery. This study presents an alternative surgical technique with a total compact ossicular prosthesis including cartilage, wire, and temporalis fascia.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 42 patients (27 adults, 15 children) underwent an ear operation for cholesteatoma requiring total ossicular chain replacement during a 10-year period. Surgery included canal wall down mastoidectomy and reconstruction of the middle ear in one stage. The total ossicular replacement prosthesis was made by a stainless steel wire passed and secured through a piece of conchal cartilage and temporalis fascia positioned on the free end of the wire. The analysis of our data included hearing results pre-surgery and post-surgery, complications recorded in the case notes, and postoperative otoscopic findings.RESULTS: The mean air-bone gap decreased from 39.2 to 22.4 dB in the early postoperative period (mean follow-up, 12.8 months). Eight patients with a long-term follow-up (mean, 7.1 years) presented a small deterioration of their postoperative hearing improvement. The bone conduction did not present significant changes. Three patients developed postoperative infection and treated successfully with medical therapy. No significant complications as displacement or extrusion of the prosthesis and retraction pocket were detected postoperatively.CONCLUSION: This is an alternative tympanoplasty technique with a stable cartilage-wire-fascia total ossicular prosthesis. This technique has a low complication rate; good hearing results and offers another surgical option to the surgeon especially for cases where the cost is a concern.

T1  - Complications with hydroxyapatite cement in mastoid cavity obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydroxyapatite (HA) bone cement is a suitable material for mastoid cavity obliteration.STUDY DESIGN & SETTING: Retrospective case review; tertiary care pediatric hospital.PATIENTS: Three patients, aged 11 to 16 years, underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy for removal of cholesteatomas.INTERVENTION: Mastoid cavity obliteration was performed with hydroxyapatite bone cement.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure was defined as the necessity for HA explantation.RESULTS: All three patients required revision surgery to remove the HA cement. Two patients (one primary and one second look with obliteration) presented with granulations in the mastoid cavity, surrounding the cement. The third patient's intraoperative findings included extensive skull base osteitis with erosion of the posterior and middle fossa dural plates, and fistulae of the lateral and superior semicircular canals. All patients recovered fully after removal of the HA cement.CONCLUSION: This study raises concerns over the use of HA cement for mastoid cavity obliteration. Three of three implanted patients required revision surgery, two with delayed failure of integration and infection, and one with severe osteitis and significant complications.

T1  - [Techniques end results of surgical treatment cholesteatoma of middle ear]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Basic surgical techniques in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma include the intact-canal-wall and canal-wall-down tympanoplasty and combined method, i.e. the "mobile-bridge" tympanoplasty. The techniques including reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal are combination of formerly mentioned methods. These tympanoplasty procedures involve a partial or complete removal of the posterior bone wall of the meatus. Subsequently, after the elimination of pathological process, the reconstruction of the middle ear is performed.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 200 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma, who had undergone various microsurgical procedures, were monitored and evaluated in the period 1998-2006. The aim of this study was to present the main principles of tympanoplasty and outcomes of middle ear cholesteatoma surgery through a comparative analysis of the applied tympanoplasty techniques. The closed ICW and open CWD tympanoplasty were compared with the combined mobile-bridge technique with the reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal.RESULTS: The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techniques with radical trepanation of the temporal bone were 6% and 10%, respectively. In cases of combined mobile-bridge tympanoplasty with the reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the auditory canal the incidence of residual cholesteatoma was 2%. The postoperative rejection of the replanted bone was observed in 2% of. the patients.CONCLUSION: The selection of the appropriate surgical procedure is determined by the type and extent of pathological process, anatomic features of the pneumatic space of the middle ear, available microsurgical equipment and otosurgical skills of the surgeon.

T1  - Otoendoscopy in cholesteatoma surgery of the middle ear: what benefits can be expected?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted with the aim of determining the contribution of otoendoscopy in the surgical management of cholesteatoma of the middle ear.BACKGROUND: The anterior epitympanum and the retrotympanum are anatomic sites that are difficult to access under otomicroscopy. Otoendoscopy offers a large field of vision using direct vision and lateral vision endoscopes, particularly in the supratubal recess and sinus tympani, for which visualization is excellent with reduced surgical approaches.The objectives of the study were to evaluate otoendoscopy as a means of identifying residues of lesions after excision of the disease under otomicroscopy in the same stage of surgery and its impact on the frequency of residual cholesteatomas at the time of surgical revision.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: Private hospital center.PATIENTS: Patients operated on a tympanoplasty under otomicroscopy with or without an otoendoscopic exploration for a cholesteatoma or an uncontrollable tympanic retraction pocket.INTERVENTIONS: Between 1994 and 2005, 350 patients underwent tympanoplasty for a cholesteatoma or an uncontrollable tympanic retraction pocket.The surgical procedures were divided into closed tympanoplasty via the transmeatal approach, closed tympanoplasty with antroatticomastoidectomy and open tympanoplasty. Tympanoplasty was initially performed systematically under otomicroscopy.After excision of the disease, the cavities of the middle ear were examined by otovideoendoscopy, with the aim of identifying any peroperative residue of the lesion, to determine its location, especially in the epitympanum and retrotympanum, and the quality of its excision under otovideoendoscopy.During surgical revision, the frequency and location of any residual cholesteatoma were systematically recorded to determine the prognostic value of the quality of excision under otovideoendoscopy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The repartition of the canal wall down, canal wall up, and transmeatic tympanoplasties was compared between the population operated with or without the otoendoscopy as a complementary exploration of the otomicroscopy in the same surgical time. The frequency and the location of a residual disease identified by the otoendoscopy and the frequency of a residual disease in a second surgical stage were evaluated.RESULTS: Eighty patients (34%) who presented with an initial location of the disease at the epitympanum underwent complementary exploration by otovideoendoscopy. In this population, the frequency of open tympanoplasty was significantly lower.In 35 cases (44%), otoendoscopy revealed a residual lesion after an apparently total excision by otomicroscopy during closed tympanoplasty.The use of otoendoscopy did not produce a significant reduction in the number of residual cholesteatomas at the second stage of surgery compared to the population that underwent surgery under otomicroscopy alone. Nevertheless, the 35 residual lesions identified under otoendoscopy, as a complement to the microscope, during the first stage of surgery would have led systematically to a residual cholesteatoma at the second stage of surgery.Complementary exploration by otoendoscopy was performed on 85 patients (34%) who presented with a lesion of the retrotympanum. In this population, the frequency of open tympanoplasty was significantly reduced, while the techniques by the transmeatal approach were used in the majority of cases.In 65 cases (76%), a residual lesion was identified by otoendoscopy during the first stage of surgery in the sinus tympani or on the footplate of the stapes, between the crura of the stapes. Otoendoscopy did not produce a reduction in the frequency of residual cholesteatomas during surgical revision. Nevertheless, as for the epitympanum, the 65 residual lesions discovered under otoendoscopy would have led systematically to a residual cholesteatoma at the second stage of surgery if otoendoscopy had not been performed during the first stage.CONCLUSION: This study confirms the real value of otoendoscopy in the surgical management of cholesteatomas of the middle ear. It belongs entirely to the minimally invasive surgical procedures, while significantly reducing the frequency of open tympanoplasty and recourse to posterior tympanotomy and offering excellent access to numerous lesions by the transmeatal approach. Analysis using otoendoscopy reduces the incidence of residual cholesteatomas by identifying lesion extensions that are overlooked under otomicroscopy. Nevertheless, some residual cholesteatomas persist at the second stage of surgery. The quality of excision under otoendoscopy constitutes an important parameter in the decision regarding revision surgery. By targeting the at-risk regions where a residual lesion was discovered, it allows the control scanner to be read with greater accuracy, thus facilitating the decision on whether to perform surgical exploration.

T1  - [Ossiculoplasty with a partial Spiggle & Theis titanium prosthesis in cholesteatoma: functional results]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report the functional results of ossicular reconstruction achieved with a specific partial prosthesis in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients presenting cholesteatoma of the middle ear were involved in a retrospective study. Tympanoplasties were performed by the same surgeon over a 30-month period. The patients underwent ossiculoplasty with the shortest nondivisible partial titanium Spiggle & Theis prosthesis. Twenty-eight procedures were canal wall-up tympanoplasties and 17 were canal wall-down procedures; 27 were primary tympanoplasties and 18 were revisions. Audiometric data were evaluated before and after surgery, with a mean follow-up of 13.4 months.RESULTS: Improvement of the air-bone gap was 6+/-12.2dB. The overall success rate was 56% and 67% using the Glasgow Benefit Plot and a postoperative air-bone gap lower than 20dB, respectively. There was no significant functional difference between canal wall-up and canal wall-down procedures. Hearing results were better in primary tympanoplasties than in revisions (p=0.004). The extrusion rate was 2.2%.CONCLUSION: The functional results observed in this study confirm that this partial titanium Spiggle & Theis prosthesis is a valuable biomaterial for ossicular reconstruction in primary tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma.

T1  - Mastoid and epitympanic bony obliteration in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of cholesteatoma surgery is complete eradication of the disease. To lower the recurrence rate in the pediatric population in canal wall up techniques and to avoid the disadvantages of canal wall down techniques, the bony obliteration technique with epitympanic and mastoid obliteration has been developed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical outcome and recurrence rate of this technique in children.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: : Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Fifty-two children (<16 yr) were operated on in 90.4% (n = 47) for a primary or recurrent cholesteatoma and in 9.6% (n = 5) for an unstable cavity.INTERVENTION: In all cases, we closed the tympanoattical barrier and the posterior tympanotomy with sculpted cortical bone and then completed obliteration of the epitympanum and mastoid with bone pate. A reconstruction of the middle ear was performed by means of an allograft tympanic membrane including the malleus handle and a sculpted allograft malleus or incus for columellar reconstruction.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent rate; residual rate; functional outcome; hygienic status of the ear; long-term safety issues.RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 49.5 months (range, 12-101.3 mo). Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in 1.9% (n = 1). Residual cholesteatoma was detected in 15.4% (n = 8) of the cases. Postoperative hearing results revealed a median gain on pure-tone averages of 14.3 dB and a median postoperative air-bone gap of 25.6 dB.CONCLUSION: The mastoid and epitympanic BOT is an effective technique to lower the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma in the pediatric population. Follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging provides a safe, noninvasive method for postoperative detection of residual cholesteatoma.

T1  - Inflammatory pseudotumor in the middle ear cavity
AB  - Inflammatory pseudotumor includes a diverse group of lesions characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and variable fibrotic responses. It is extremely rare in the middle ear alone. A 7-year-old girl presented right hearing impairment. Because an otitis media with effusion was first suspected, a myringotomy was performed, but it found a mass that was different from a congenital cholesteatoma. Canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy removed the mass successfully. The pathologic study of the specimen confirmed an inflammatory pseudotumor. We report an extremely rare case of the inflammatory pseudotumor in the middle ear with a review of the poor literature about this subject. [References: 7]

T1  - Audiologic results of surgery for cholesteatoma: short- and long-term follow-up of influential factors
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the audiologic results in a cohort of patients surgically treated for cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient records.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: A retrospective study of patients operated on for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma during the period 1990 to 2002 was performed. A total of 758 patients were followed during a short-term period, and 611 patients were followed during a long-term period. The patients were divided into 3 age groups: children, adolescents, and adults. The localization of cholesteatoma was classified as attic, sinus, or tensa.INTERVENTIONS: Closed tympanoplasty was always performed as the single procedure of choice on all the children, and reoperation or conversion to open tympanoplasty was made later if needed. Adult patients were treated with single classic canal wall up, or wall down (CWD), according to the propagation of disease and condition of middle ear.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and pure-tone average were compared after short-term and long-term follow-up.RESULTS: Average hearing improvement (reduction of ABG) amounted 20.0 dB for short-term and deteriorated to 18.0 dB during long-term analysis for all the patients. Preoperative hearing level was significantly worse for CWD than for intact canal wall technique. The ABG closure was much better in the group with attic cholesteatoma. Both preoperative and postoperative hearing levels were worse for children than for adolescents or adults. Revision operations and bilateral cholesteatoma gave worse total postoperative hearing. The long-term results of primary operations, when recurrent cholesteatoma did not occur, were stable. Damage to auditory ossicles correlated well with total preoperative and postoperative results. The most hearing improvement was verified for the frequencies between 500 and 3,000 Hz, and there was no sensorineural hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The audiologic results of cholesteatoma surgery are preserved during long-term follow-up. We found that recurrent cholesteatoma was associated with diminished postoperative hearing. Poorer preoperative hearing level, CWD tympanoplasty, younger age, bilateral cholesteatoma, and ossicular damage, as well as revision surgery, were associated with reduced gains in hearing with surgical management. Surgical experience was important for ICW technique and for advanced damage of auditory ossicles. Recurrent cholesteatoma resulted in significantly worse hearing results for each analyzed parameter.

T1  - The investigation of the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Three hundred forty-five patients with middle ear cholesteatoma operated on by the same surgeon between 1987 and 2002.METHODS: The cumulative recurrence rate of cholesteatoma during a 5-year follow-up period was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.RESULTS: The overall 5-year recurrence rate was 11.8%. The recurrence rate increased with the follow-up time. The 5-year recurrence rate was 3.9% in patients treated with canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWDT) and 16.7% in patients treated with intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall reconstruction (CWR) after CWDT with a significant difference (p < 0.01). The 5-year recurrence rate was 26.0% in patients operated on between 1987 and 1996 and 0.7% in patients operated on between 1997 and 2002, again with a significant difference (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis should be used for calculating the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma. Although this analytic method further demonstrates that CWDT is a more reliable surgical method than ICWT/CWR in reducing cholesteatoma recurrence, clinical judgment should be exercised, and we continue to recommend that a flexible approach should be adopted in deciding whether to perform CWDT or ICWT/CWR for individual cases.

T1  - Cartilage ossiculoplasty by lever method
AB  - CONCLUSION: We invented a new ossicular chain reconstruction by lever methods (OCRLM) in tympanoplasty type III with the canal wall down technique and investigated the postoperative hearing results of the 24 patients who had undergone this surgery. Postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) followed up for 2.1-3.2 years gave satisfactory improvement audiometrically compared with former reports.OBJECTIVE: To present newly devised methods applied from the viewpoint of mechanical dynamics for ossicular chain reconstruction in tympanoplasty.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 24 cholesteatoma patients who underwent tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy using the canal wall down technique and ossicular chain reconstruction with OCRLM between May 2003 and April 2004 were investigated. The postoperative ABG of a four-frequency (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) average of OCRLM followed up for 2 years or more was assessed.RESULTS: Patients who underwent OCRLM showed good postoperative hearing results. Average postoperative ABGs of less than 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 dB were 4.2, 37.5, 70.8, 91.6, and 100%, respectively. A gap of >30 dB was absent and the mean postoperative ABG was 17.2dB. The OCRLM method was satisfactory to improve hearing and effectively reduce the ABG postoperatively over the period of observation.

T1  - Residual cholesteatoma: incidence and localization in canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and localization of residual cholesteatomas in canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction with results with the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty or canal wall up tympanoplasty.DESIGN: Retrospective case-series study.SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital.PATIENTS: Eighty-five patients (85 ears) with fresh extensive cholesteatomas who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction as first-stage surgery and a second operation after 1 year to confirm residual cholesteatomas and perform ossiculoplasty.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence and localization of residual cholesteatomas in the middle ear were compared between surgery using the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty and canal wall up tympanoplasty. Possible technical causes of the residua were reviewed in a retrospective videotape analysis of the first-stage operations.RESULTS: Of the 85 ears operated on, 18 had residual cholesteatomas, for an overall incidence of 21%, with 1 residuum per ear. Six cholesteatomas were located in the epitympanum (33%), 3 in the sinus tympani (17%), 3 in the antrum (17%), 2 on the stapes (11%), 2 on the tympanic membrane (11%), 1 on the tympanic portion of the facial canal (6%), and 1 just under the skin of the external auditory canal (6%). The retrospective videotape analysis revealed that the main cause of residual cholesteatomas in the epitympanum and sinus tympani was incomplete removal of the matrix under an indirect surgical view because of insufficient drilling. Residual matrix in a bony defect in the middle cranial fossa or facial canal was the cause of residual cholesteatomas in the antrum or facial canal. Inappropriate keratinizing epithelium rolling during tympanic membrane or external auditory canal reconstruction was the cause of residual cholesteatomas in the tympanic membrane or external auditory canal.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of residual cholesteatomas in patients who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction was similar to that in patients who underwent surgery involving the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty or canal wall up tympanoplasty. In terms of localization, with canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction, there is the possibility of residua not only in the tympanic cavity but also in the antrum or mastoid cavity, as with the canal wall up method. Results of this study suggest that in patients with extensive cholesteatoma, canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction should be followed by a second procedure to detect any residual cholesteatomas in the tympanic cavity, antrum, or mastoid cavity.

T1  - Detection of postoperative residual cholesteatoma with non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the role of non-echo-planar imaging (non-EPI)-based diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of residual cholesteatoma after canal wall-up mastoidectomy before eventual second-look surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective and blinded study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: The study group included the surgical, clinical, and imaging follow-up of 32 consecutive patients after primary cholesteatoma surgery.INTERVENTIONS: All patients were investigated with MRI, including late postgadolinium T1-weighted sequence and non-EPI-DW sequence, 10 to 18 months after first-stage cholesteatoma surgery by experienced surgeons using a canal wall-up mastoidectomy. The non-EPI-DW images were evaluated for the presence of a high-signal intensity lesion consistent with residual cholesteatoma. Imaging findings were correlated with findings from second-stage surgery in 19 patients, clinical follow-up examination in 11 patients, and, in 2 patients, clinical and MRI follow-up examination.RESULTS: Non-EPI-DW sequences depicted 9 of 10 residual cholesteatomas. The only lesion missed was a 2-mm cholesteatoma in an examination degraded by motion artifacts in a child. All other diagnosed cholesteatomas measured between 2 and 6 mm. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 90, 100, 100, and 96%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Except for motion artifact-degraded examinations, non-EPI-DW MRI is able to detect even very small residual cholesteatoma after first-stage surgery by showing a high-signal intensity lesion. It has the capability of selecting patients for second-look surgery, avoiding unnecessary second-look surgery.

T1  - Comparison of echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging and delayed postcontrast T1-weighted MR imaging for the detection of residual cholesteatoma
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and delayed postcontrast T1-weighted MR imaging (DPI) have been proposed in previous studies to detect residual middle ear cholesteatomas, with varying results. We assessed and compared these 2 techniques in patients with canal wall-up tympanoplasty.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study. Patients who underwent surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma had CT scanning 9 months after the surgery. If opacity was observed (64%) on CT scans, DWI and DPI were performed before second-look surgery. CT, MR imaging, and surgical data were available for 31 patients. Charts were reviewed independently by 3 blinded examiners. Interobserver agreement for MR imaging was calculated (Cohen kappa). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for these techniques: 1) alone or in association, and 2) according to the residual cholesteatoma size measured during surgery.RESULTS: Interobserver agreement was better for DWI (kappa = 0.81) than for DPI (kappa = 0.51). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV values were 60%, 72.73%, 80%, and 50%, respectively, with DWI; and 90%, 54.55%, 78.26%, and 75%, respectively, with DPI. With cholesteatomas >5 mm, the sensitivity and specificity of DWI reached 100% and 88%, respectively, with values for DPI reaching 100% and 80%, respectively. The association of both techniques only allowed improvements in the specificity for lesions >5 mm.CONCLUSIONS: Both techniques gave acceptable results for residual cholesteatoma detection. DWI is more specific but less sensitive than DPI. Their concurrent use may benefit patients by avoiding undue surgery.

T1  - Managing chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma report of 223 patients seen in a 5-year period
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of patients having chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma seen in the ENT/Head and Neck Surgery Clinic at the University Clinical Center, Prishtina, Kosovo.METHOD: A systematic review of the medical records of all patients admitted to the ENT clinic having COM with cholesteatoma between January 1999 and December 2003.RESULTS: During this period, 223 patients suffering from COM with cholesteatoma underwent surgical treatment. There were 123 (55%) male and 100 (45%) female patients. Their mean age was 30.7 years, ranging from youngest patient (7-year-old girl) to oldest (73-year-old lady). Thirty-three patients developed complications: 17 patients extracranial complications (EC) and 16 intracranial complications (IC). Leading pathogens in this series were Proteus mirabilis in 52% of cases, Proteus vulgaris in 14% and Staphylococcus aureus in 12%. All patients underwent surgical treatment: 10 patients (4.5%) a canal-wall up (CWU) procedure and 213 (95.5%) a canal-wall down (CWD) procedure. No deaths occurred in this series.CONCLUSION: Because of possibility of developing life-threatening complications, patients with COM with cholestatoma must diagnosed in time and followed as soon as possible to the center that performs ear surgery, as only adequate treatment option for these patients.

T1  - Intraoperative findings in revision canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - Effective canal wall down mastoid surgery requires attention to certain key principles. We reviewed all cases requiring revision surgery at the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital over a 6 year period 1999-2004. Intraoperative findings which contributed to the need for revision surgery were identified. During this 6 year period 291 canal wall down mastoidectomies were performed. Thirty-seven were revision procedures. Nineteen (51%) cases were found to have recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. Sixteen (43%) cases had a high facial ridge, thirteen (35%) cases had an open middle ear. Nine (24%) cases had an inadequate meatus, 2 (5%) cases had a cavity sump. This study illustrated that a high facial ridge, an open middle ear segment, an inadequate meatoplasty and recurrent cholesteatoma were common intraoperative findings in this revision group. Eighty-nine percent of revision cases had dry, healed and safe cavities on follow up. Poor performance of the open technique is the most important factor in failure.

T1  - Intraoperative findings in revision chronic otitis media surgery
AB  - In this study, we reviewed the surgical findings in a series of revision tympanomastoidectomy to determine the most common causes of failure in chronic otitis media surgery. The intraoperative findings at revision mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty of 116 patients were analyzed. The most common sites of pathologic tissue at revision surgery (with cholesteatoma and/ or granulation tissue) were unexenterated cells of the sinodural angle. The most common mechanical cause of retention of debris in canal wall down procedures was facial ridge.

T1  - The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of residual or recurrent acquired cholesteatoma after canal wall-up tympanoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the diagnosis of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma after canal wall-up tympanoplasty is studied in a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: A total of 31 patients, who underwent 32 canal wall-up tympanoplasty procedures with MRI before revision surgery, were included in the study.INTERVENTIONS: MRI examination, using both the conventional and echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences, was performed, with additional spin echo diffusion-weighted MRI sequences in 4 patients. All patients were treated with a canal wall-up tympanoplasty.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma at revision surgery is matched with preoperative findings on MRI.RESULTS: MRI could correctly detect the residual disease in 54.5% of the surgically matched residual or recurrent cholesteatomas. MRI yielded a false-negative result in 45.5%. There was 1 false-positive result (10%). Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of MRI were 54.4%, 90%, 92.3%, and 47.4%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Preoperative MRI could correctly detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in somewhat over half the cases. A high number of false-negative results were obtained. At thismoment, MRI cannot yet replace revision surgery.

T1  - Mid-temporal pericranial and inferiorly based periosteal flaps in mastoid obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the outcome of mastoid obliterations where mid-temporal pericranial flap and inferiorly based periosteal flap were used.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal study with a minimum follow-up of 1 year.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2005, 102 mastoid obliterations were performed on 96 patients, the majority having hydroxyapatite granules as fillers. Of these, 31 were primary obliterations and 71 were secondary obliterations. Thirty were on children under 16.RESULTS: Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the percentage of ears that were free of residual cholesteatoma at 5 years was 91% (95% CI: 83.1%, 100.0%). There was no recurrent cholesteatoma. Cut-off analysis was used to study other parameters at 5 years. The 5-year otorrhea rate was zero, and 96% of the cavities became completely epithelialized. Twenty out of 24 ears were water resistant, and 50% had air-bone gaps of 20 dB or better.CONCLUSION: The outcome of this technique compares favorably to other reports.

T1  - [Imaging features and surgical approach of external auditory canal cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the clinical and imaging features of external auditory canal cholesteatoma (EACC) and determine the characteristics most important to its clinical management.METHOD: Seventeen cases (21 ears) of EACC were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data were collected for the history, presentation, physical examination findings and CT scans. The surgical management approaches were reviewed.RESULT: Patients presented with otalgia (n = 21), otorrhea (n = 16), ear-canal stenosis (n = 11), facial nerve dysfunction (n = 4). CT scans showed a soft tissue mass with adjacent bone erosion (n =21). Middle ear and mastoid involvement (n = 9), facial canal erosion (n = 4), sigmoid sinus erosion (n = 1) and jugular bulb dehiscence (n = 1) were observed. EACC excision and canaloplasty through transcanal approaches were performed in 12 ears, while postauricular incision and canal wall down mastoidectomy were used in 9 ears.CONCLUSION: The possible causes of EACC and its possible extension may influence clinical management. Preoperative high-resolution temporal bone CT scans can be helpful in the diagnosis and management of EACC.

T1  - Management of tympanosclerosis with ossicular fixation: review and presentation of long-term results of 30 new cases
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgery for tympanosclerosis has always been challenged with the risk of deterioration of hearing or the recurrence of the disease. If surgery is indicated, controversy exists regarding staging versus nonstaging and whether to perform stapedectomy or mobilize the fixed ossicles by removal of plaques. The aim of this study was to review the previous reports and to analyze the long-term surgical outcome of 30 patients who have been operated on owing to tympanosclerosis.METHODS: Nine hundred twelve cases with chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma that have undergone either the intact canal wall or canal wall down mastoidectomy technique were analyzed retrospectively. Thirty patients who underwent ossicular chain reconstruction between 1990 and 2005 owing to conductive hearing loss resulting from tympanosclerosis were selected after excluding those patients who had repair of a sclerotic eardrum only. The types of surgery for restoration of hearing loss, postoperative hearing gain, and closure of air-bone gaps were compared. The average follow-up was 4.3 years.RESULTS: There were 19 male and 11 female patients, with ages ranging between 12 and 48 (27.6 +/- 9 years). Fourteen patients (47%) underwent myringoplasty and ossiculoplasty only, 14 patients (47%) had simple mastoidectomy, and 2 patients (6%) had a modified radical mastoidectomy owing to associated cholesteatoma. Seven patients with advanced tympanosclerosis had stapedectomy and a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), five patients had stapes mobilization and a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), two patients had incus transposition, one patient had a tragal cartilage graft over the stapes as ossicular reconstruction, and one patient had a graft over the incus. Fourteen patients with an intact ossicular chain had a mobilization procedure associated with mastoidectomy and atticotomy. Thirty-three percent of the patients had less than 20 dB air-bone gaps in the long term. Patients with stapedectomy with TORP and PORP application presented with better air-bone gap closure (to 20 dB) compared with those with the mobilization procedure only. None of the patients had a dead ear after surgery.CONCLUSION: The success of the surgery was dictated by the location and the extent of tympanosclerotic involvement. Controversy still remains concerning the long-term results of the surgical management of tympanosclerosis, and the results are not satisfactory, as seen in surgery for otosclerosis.

T1  - Preliminary experience with beta-tricalcium phosphate for use in mastoid cavity obliteration after mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy and safety of mastoid cavity obliteration using highly purified beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) after mastoidectomy in middle ear surgery.PATIENTS: Thirteen patients with cholesteatoma invading the mastoid cavity or showing severe pathologic changes in the mastoid cavity.INTERVENTION: Twelve patients underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during the first- and/or second-stage operation of a 2-stage canal-up operation: 5 patients during the first and second stages, and 7 patients during the second stage only. One patient with cholesteatoma underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during a 1-stage canal-up operation. In total, beta-TCP was applied in 18 ear operations.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before and after surgery to assess the condition of the middle ear. The amount of residual beta-TCP granules in the mastoid cavity was assessed using the following granular shadow grading scale: Grade 0, no granular shadow in the mastoid cavity; Grade 1, residual granular shadows in part of the mastoid cavity; and Grade 2, granular shadows in most of the mastoid cavity. To assess any harmful effect of beta-TCP implanted in the mastoid cavity, continuous postoperative discharge and delayed wound healing were recorded. In addition, the bone conduction threshold was assessed using pure-tone audiometry, and the patients were asked whether they experienced vertigo or dizziness during the postoperative follow-up.RESULTS: All the patients who underwent multislice CT less than 11.4 months after mastoid cavity obliteration with beta-TCP were Grade 2 on the granular shadow grading scale, whereas all those who underwent multislice CT more than 53.8 months after mastoid obliteration were Grade 0. No patient had continuous postoperative discharge, delayed wound healing, or extrusion of beta-TCP granules. No patient showed deterioration of the bone conduction threshold more than 10 dB after mastoid cavity obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP or complained of postoperative vertigo or dizziness.CONCLUSION: Highly purified beta-TCP may be safe and reliable for mastoid obliteration. Highly purified beta-TCP may also be useful in other surgical procedures, including posterior wall reconstruction of the external auditory canal and scutum plasty.

T1  - [Surgical strategy for treatment of cholesteatoma otitis media]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the otologic surgical procedures for cholesteatoma otitis media and improve the surgery results and living quality of patients following the operation of tympanomastoidectomy.METHODS: Two hundreds and sixty-six cases (269 ears) of tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma otitis media followed up for more than 3 years between 1994 to 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. The long-term results of recurrence and hearing level was discussed on the procedure of canal wall up (CWU), canal wall down (CWD) and modified intact-bridge tympanomastoidectomy (IBM).RESULTS: On the contrast of improved hearing level, there were not significant difference between CWU group and CWD group (F = 3.686, P>0.05), but the results of IBM group was significantly better than others (F = 125.167 and 59.438, P <0.05). On the contrast of duration of getting dry ear, IBM and CWU groups [(5.0 +/- 1.9) weeks and (6.0 +/- 1.6) weeks respectively] were significantly shorter than CWD group [(9.0 +/- 2.8) weeks; F = 56.32 and 30.639, P <0.05]. As the recurrence rate, IBM group and CWD group were significantly lower than CWU group (CWU: 24.6%; CWD: 6.0%; IBM: 7.0%) chi2 = 6.162 and 6.007, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: With the modified IBM technique, cholesteatoma could be removed completely and safely from the middle ear and a reasonable reconstruction of middle ear with approved hearing level could be achieved. The surgical procedure usually began with CWU and should be change according to the pathological founding of middle ear during operation. Modified IBM was a valuable choice for the surgical treatment of cholesteatoma otitis media.

T1  - Tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy, is highly effective for treatment of chronic otitis media in children
AB  - CONCLUSION: The overall success rate of tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy, in the treatment of chronic pediatric otitis media, was high and did not depend on patient age, the status of the contralateral ear, the inclusion or absence of surgical mastoidectomy, or the method of mastoidectomy (when this procedure was employed). Tympanoplasty may be expected to improve hearing in cases of chronic otitis media accompanied by perforation, but not in cases of cholesteatoma.OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the clinical features of pediatric patents with chronic otitis media undergoing tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy. Follow-up data were examined to determine the effectiveness of these procedures on the course of the patients' conditions.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 111 children (a total of 119 ears were treated from this group) aged 15 years or less, who underwent surgical treatment for pediatric chronic otitis media. The subjects were composed of children suffering from chronic otitis media with perforation (COMP) (63 ears), and patients presenting chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (COMC) (56 ears). The mean follow-up period was 40 months. Preoperative and postoperative (at the final follow-up) audiometry and otologic examinations were performed. Data from postoperative otologic examinations and audiometric measurements were accompanied by examination of both the operative ear and the contralateral ear. Surgical success was defined as the presence of an intact tympanic membrane without perforation, retraction, or evidence of recurring cholesteatoma.RESULTS: The mean ages at the time of operation were 11.1+/-3.3 years for COMP patients and 9.7+/-3.0 years for COMC subjects. Surgical treatments for pediatric COMP and COMC patients included tympanoplasty only in 45 ears (38% of ears treated) and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy in 74 ears (62%). Most of patients with COMC received tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. No patient with COMP underwent canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Mean pre-operative air-bone gaps (ABGs) and post-operative ABGs were compared. Significant improvement in ABG was evident in the COMP group, but not in the COMC group. Surgical success rates at follow-up after 6 months and 12 months were 97% and 95%, respectively, in the COMP group. In the COMC patients, surgical success rates at follow-up after 6 months and 12 months were 98% and 93%. There were no significant relationships between surgical success rate and patient age, the status of the contralateral ear, or the extent of surgery.

T1  - Obliteration of the persistently discharging mastoid cavity using the middle temporal artery flap
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the surgical outcome of patients undergoing obliteration of a persistently discharging mastoid cavity with specific soft tissue vascular flaps for chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: A five-year retrospective consecutive case review in a tertiary care referral center. Following mastoidectomy obliteration with a superiorly based middle temporal artery, axial periosteal flap and inferiorly based random pedicled musculoperiosteal flap was performed. The primary outcome was control of suppuration and the creation of a dry, low-maintenance cavity as assessed by a semi-quantitative scale.RESULTS: A total of 51 consecutive patients undergoing revision mastoidectomy with obliteration were identified with a minimum follow-up of 12 months; 43 (84%) had a small dry healthy mastoid cavity; three ears (6%) had occasional otorrhea that was relatively easily managed by topical therapy.CONCLUSION: Obliteration using the middle temporal artery and inferior random flaps is an effective method to manage patients with pre-existing cavities and also those not previously operated upon.

T1  - Follow-up of cholesteatoma surgery: open versus closed tympanoplasty
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no universally accepted opinions about the choice of surgical technique and outcome of surgery for cholesteatoma in different age groups and localizations.METHODS: A prospective study of 758 patients with cholesteatomas was performed. They were divided into three age groups: children younger than 9 years, adolescents aged 10-16 years, and adults. Cholesteatoma was classified as: attic, sinus and tensa cholesteatoma. Classical canal wall-up or wall-down tympanoplasty was performed in all the cases, and reoperation was done later if needed. Anatomical and functional results were followed up regularly, and evaluated 3 years after the operations.RESULTS: During the postoperative course, after 3 years, retraction of the neomembrane was found in 23.8% of younger children, 27.6% of adolescents, and in 9.9% of adults. Recurrent cholesteatomas were more than twice as frequent in children (19.0%) as in adults (9.4%). Reoperation was performed in 38.1% of children and in 9.4% adults. In one fourth of pediatric cholesteatoma reoperations, conversion to open tympanoplasty was done. Retraction and recurrent disease were present in about 10% of attic and sinus cholesteatomas, and in 15.5% of tensa cholesteatomas.CONCLUSION: Postoperative audiological results of cholesteatoma surgery in children are comparable to adults. Retraction pockets, recurrent cholesteatomas and reoperations are twice as frequent in the pediatric group as in adults. The worst anatomical and functional results are achieved in tensa cholesteatomas. The age of the patient and localization of cholesteatoma are very important factors that determine the type of surgical procedure and the results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. A closed technique is better for attic and sinus cholesteatomas, while in tensa cholesteatomas, an open technique seems more appropriate. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

T1  - Value of high-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of residual cholesteatomas in primary bony obliterated mastoids
AB  - PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to assess the value of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and that of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including postcontrast T(1)-weighted images and echo-planar diffusion-weighted (EP-DW) images, in the detection of residual cholesteatomas after primary bony obliteration of the mastoid.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients underwent a second-look surgery 8 to 18 months after they underwent a primary bony obliteration technique. All patients were evaluated by HRCT and MRI before their second-look surgery. A retrospective analysis was performed.RESULTS: A residual cholesteatoma was found in 2 of the 23 patients; both cases of cholesteatoma had a diameter less than 4 mm. In these 2 patients, residual cholesteatoma was found in the middle ear cavity and not in the obliterated mastoid. In all cases, HRCT showed a homogeneous obliteration of the mastoid cavity. On MRI, only one cholesteatoma pearl was detected using contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging. Findings from the EP-DW imaging were negative for all cases.CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HRCT is still the imaging technique of choice for the evaluation of bony obliterated mastoids. It shows the low sensitivity and specificity of HRCT for the characterization of an associated opacified middle ear and those of contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging and EP-DW imaging for the detection of small residual cholesteatomas after primary bony obliteration.

T1  - Indications for and outcomes of mastoid obliteration in cochlear implantation
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the indications, efficacy, and long-term outcomes of mastoid obliteration in cochlear implant surgery.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Seventeen patients who underwent a mastoid obliteration procedure to facilitate the insertion of a cochlear implant between 1978 and 2005.INTERVENTION: Mastoid obliteration procedure before cochlear implantation.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Revision rate of the mastoid obliteration and cochlear implantation, postoperative audiometric scores (consonant-nucleus-consonant words/phonemes, Central Institute for the Deaf sentences, City University New York sentences in quiet and in noise), and incidence of complications.RESULTS: There were 17 patients with a median age of 60 years (range, 3-79 yr). Eight patients required mastoid obliteration for active chronic suppurative otitis media before cochlear implantation. Another 8 patients had existing mastoid cavities requiring obliteration (modified radical [n = 5] and fenestration cavities [n = 3]). A single patient with a sclerotic mastoid and an anterior sigmoid sinus underwent obliteration because of inadequate surgical access. The technique of obliteration was radical mastoidectomy with eustachian tube occlusion, blind sac closure of the external auditory canal, and cavity obliteration with either temporalis muscle flap (n = 15) or abdominal fat (n = 2). Cochlear implantation and mastoid obliteration were performed as a two-stage procedure in 10 patients and as a single-stage procedure in 7. Two patients required revision of the mastoid obliteration. At follow-up, all patients had stable obliterated cavities. Fifteen patients obtained significant improvement in speech discrimination scores, whereas 2 patients obtained some benefit from the cochlear implant through the perception of environmental sounds.CONCLUSION: For patients with chronic suppurative otitis media or existing mastoid cavities, the obliteration with temporalis muscle or abdominal fat is an effective technique to facilitate safe cochlear implantation.

T1  - Assessment of visualization of structures in the middle ear via Tos modified canal wall-up mastoidectomy versus classic canal wall-up and canal wall-down mastoidectomies
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the differences in the ability to view structures in the middle ear between Tos modified canal wall-up mastoidectomy and classic canal wall-up (CWU) and canal wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomies.METHODS: Eighteen temporal bones of 10 cadaver heads were used. Six bones were randomly selected for each surgical technique (Tos' technique, CWU and CWD mastoidectomies) and fixed on an operating table. In the Tos' technique: (1) transmeatal posterior tympanotomy with drilling of the supero-posterior bony annulus, (2) transmeatal atticotomy with preservation of the bony bridge and (3) cortical mastoidectomy were performed. In the classic CWU mastoidectomy, cortical mastoidectomy and posterior atticotympanotomy (facial recess approach) were performed. Incus and posterior half of the tympanic membrane were removed from all temporal bones. An independent specialist performing otologic surgery evaluated all of the temporal bones and approved the proper extent of dissections. Two another independent observers blinded to the purpose of the study were asked to point five anatomic structures and locations (sinus tympani, anterior attic, posterior crus, lateral attic and the Eustachian tube orifice) in two different sessions. Observers were allowed to rotate the operating table as it has been done during otologic surgery, and the line of view for the observers was both transmastoid and transcanal. The ability to view these structures was recorded as "correct/visible" or "incorrect/invisible". These records were also verified after removing the posterior and superior walls of the outer ear canal in temporal bones of the Tos and CWU groups at the end of the study.RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the ability to view middle ear structures between the Tos' technique and CWU mastoidectomy as well as between CWU and CWD mastoidectomies, with the Tos' and CWD techniques almost equally showing superiority to CWU (p<.0001). Of the five locations, sinus tympani and anterior attic were observed more frequently with the Tos' technique versus CWU (p=.001). Sinus tympani (p<.005), anterior attic (p=.001) and posterior crus (p<.05) were observed more frequently with CWD versus CWU. There was no significant difference in the ability to observe lateral attic and the Eustachian tube orifice among the three techniques. In addition, there was no significant difference in the ability to visualize all the five locations between the Tos' and CWD technique.CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analysis showed good reproducibility of this randomised, blinded study. Tos' modified CWU mastoidectomy, in which most part of the canal wall is intact, showed similar advantage of the CWD in viewing structures in the middle ear. The Tos' technique and CWD mastoidectomy provided better visualization of sinus tympani and anterior attic that are the most frequent places of residual cholesteatoma in the classic CWU mastoidectomy.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration combined with soft-wall reconstruction of posterior ear canal
AB  - To clarify the usefulness of modified soft-wall reconstruction method by combing with mastoid obliteration, 96 patients (98 ears) with their age ranging from 5 to 82 (average 51.3), including 62 ears with chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma, 18 ears with non-cholesteatomatous COM, 14 ears with postoperative cavity problem, and 4 ears with adhesive-type COM, who had soft-wall reconstruction of the posterior ear canal and mastoid obliteration using mainly bone powder following mastoidectomy, were evaluated their postoperative conditions more than a year after surgery. Overall success rate was 76.5% (75/98), and fresh cases showed better success rate (84.8%) than those with a history of multiple surgeries (69.2%). Among unsuccessful cases, crust and/or debris accumulation was observed most (nine ears), followed by persistent wet condition (seven ears), and exposure of the obliterated material (five ears), while only two ears showed a retraction pocket formation. The success rates remained almost the same among those who were followed for more than 2 and 3 years (46/61, 75% and 21/28, 75%, respectively). In 60 ears on which postoperative hearing was assessed, 41.7% showed less than 15 dB of air-bone gap (ABG), and 61.7% showed less than 20 dB of ABG. Mastoid obliteration with bone powder in combination with soft-wall reconstruction of the posterior ear canal appeared a useful method for obliterating mastoidectomized cavity especially for prevention of postoperative pocket formation.

T1  - Canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy: the 'on-disease' approach for retraction pockets and cholesteatoma
AB  - It is well known that cholesteatoma is three-dimensional; hence, we feel that its surgical management requires a three-dimensional approach in order to achieve the best curative and functional results. Retraction pockets are undeniably caused by chronic and recurrent eustachian tube obstruction. However, we found that the presence of a large mastoid antrum was an important, additional aetiological factor in the formation of a retraction pocket and its progression to cholesteatoma formation, with bone destruction and subsequent complications. Canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy--the 'on-disease' approach--is an innovative, three-dimensional technique based on universally accepted surgical principles. We modified the technique to ensure complete exposure and thereby eradication of the disease, with a resultant small cavity. Working in a three-dimensional field, we began drilling at the posterior meatal wall, lowering it while simultaneously widening the cavity as the mastoid was drilled to reach the antrum and the aditus. The bridge was lowered and the incus removed to completely expose the entire disease. The facial ridge was debulked and the temporalis fascia graft placed so as to simplify the middle-ear cleft. We present a comprehensive report of this technique, based upon 600 patients studied retrospectively over a five-year period. After one-year follow up, 546 patients had a dry, healed cavity. Canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy performed by the on-disease approach ensures complete eradication of the disease, with excellent curative as well as functional results.

T1  - [Reconstruction of the auditory canal wall with bone chips from the temporal squama--preliminary results]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The canal wall down-technique in cholesteatoma surgery with the creation of an open mastoid cavity offers many disadvantages as prolonged healing time, necessity for periodic cleaning and subsequent infections. Therefore reconstruction of the posterosuperior canal wall is the more and more preferred technique to restore the physiologic anatomy of the external auditory canal without lacking a good surgical exposure to the tympanal and retrotympanal spaces. Cartilage is the mainly used material for this technique, as cartilage is easy to prepare and to fit into the defect with good viability. However, cartilage resorption and retraction is observed increasing the risk for recurrent cholesteatoma. In contrast, by the use of bone chips from the temporal squama a stable and close restoration of the auditory canal wall can be achieved.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 23 patients (17 attic and 6 sinus cholesteatomas including two recurrences in each group) we have performed an anterior atticoantrostomy with retrograde cholesteatoma removal and reconstructed the posterosuperior wall of the auditory canal with bone chips harvested from the temporal squama by chisels. The bone chips and remaining gaps in the reconstructed wall were covered by bone pate and temporal fascia. In 4 cases the ossicular chain could be conserved (type-1 tympanoplasty [TP]), type-3 TP with PORP was performed in 13 and TORP-TP in 6 cases. The mean follow-up was 12.1 months (range 4 - 34 months). 8 patients had undergone a second-look procedure.RESULTS: On follow-up all patients showed a good healing of the external ear canal with no graft insufficiency. In one case we observed a slight ear canal narrowing due to bone excess, three patients developed retraction pockets of the attic. Recurrent cholesteatoma was not seen yet. Second-look tympanotomy revealed complete ingrowth of the transplanted bone chips into the surrounding bony structures in all cases. One residual cholesteatoma had to be removed and the canal wall had to be reconstructed again with bone chips. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 7.0 +/- 8.2 dB HL for type-1 TP, 8.6 +/- 3.0 dB HL for PORP-TP (83 % [100 %] of the patients < or = 10 dB HL [< or = 20 dB HL]) and 19.3 +/- 9.2 dB HL for TORP-TP (66 % of the patients < or = 20 dB).CONCLUSIONS: Osteoplastic atticoantrostomy allows adequate anatomic and physiologic restoration of the auditory canal even after extensive cholesteatoma removal. Bone stability may reduce recurrent cholesteatoma. However, due to the underlying impaired tubal function long-time results must be further evaluated.

T1  - Preservation of the mastoid aeration and prevention of mastoid dimpling in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma surgery using hyaluronate-based bioresorbable membrane (Seprafilm)
AB  - During mastoidectomy a hollow-cavity is formed within the mastoid bone after its cortex and air cells are removed. Postoperatively, the aerated cavity is usually filled with soft tissues. Also it is not so uncommon to see cases with retraction of the mastoid area skin into the cavity causing a cosmetic problem termed as mastoid dimpling. In order to achieve an aerated mastoid cavity and minimizing the mastoid dimpling, an adhesion barrier was utilized to prevent fibrous tissue formation within the cavity. Twenty-one patients with middle ear and/or mastoid cholesteatoma, who underwent tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy (canal wall-up) with staged procedures, were included in the study. The mastoid cavity was tented and covered with an adhesion barrier (hyaluranic acid and carboxymethylcellulose, Seprafilm, (Seprafilm, GENZYME Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) at the end of the surgery. Postoperatively, in two cases serohemorrhagic fluid collected between the adhesion barrier membrane and the subcutaneous tissues requiring drainage. Second stages were performed 4-6 months after the first stage. Two residual cholesteatoma cases were present. Patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years after the second stage. Mean follow-up was 2 years and 5 months. No wound infection was encountered postoperatively. Late follow-up of minimum 2 years after the second surgery revealed cosmetically acceptable retroauricular area with no dimpling. Mild retraction in two cases and two micro-central perforations in the neotympanic membrane were found. CT scans obtained both prior to the second stage and at the end of the second year of second stage revealed fully aerated mastoid cavities covered with periosteum in its natural position. Mastoid cortex plasty with seprafilm offers a rapid and effective solution to the preservation of mastoid space and the preservation of the contours of the mastoid bone.

T1  - Infective causes of facial nerve paralysis
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the functional recovery in a cohort of patients with facial nerve paralysis (FNP) due to infective cause.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review based on patients identified from a prospectively maintained database of patients with FNP. The case notes of identified patients were reviewed.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: The patients were identified from a database of 1074 patients with FNP. One hundred twenty of the 150 patients identified as having FNP due to an infectious disease caused by herpes zoster oticus were excluded from the study. The remaining 30 patients were included in the study.INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated both operatively and nonoperatively. Operative treatment included myringotomy and ventilation tube placement, cortical mastoidectomy, modified radical (canal wall down) mastoidectomy, petrous apicectomy, and lateral temporal bone resection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This study used the House-Brackmann (HB) grade of facial function at 1 year after initial assessment. The patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database of all patients presenting with FNP to a single specialist otolaryngologist (G.R.C.) between June 1988 and April 2005. The database contains information including demographic details, dates of presentation, diagnostic modalities used, diagnosis, interventions, and HB grade. The patients in this series presented between August 4, 1989 and August 26, 2003.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with 30 facial nerve paralyses were identified. The causes of FNP were acute otitis media (n = 10); cholesteatoma (n = 10 [acquired, 7; congenital, 3]); mastoid cavity infections (n = 2); malignant otitis externa (n = 2); noncholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM; n = 2); tuberculous mastoiditis (n = 1); suppurative parotitis (n = 1); and chronic granulomatosis (n = 1). The patients with noncholesteatomatous CSOM who presented sooner after the onset of facial nerve symptoms had greater facial nerve recovery when assessed using the HB grade at 1 year.CONCLUSION: FNP due to infective causes other than herpes zoster oticus is rare. Patients with noncholesteatomatous CSOM and FNP have a better outcome than those with FNP due to cholesteatoma. Patients with FNP due to acute otitis media tend to have a good prognosis without surgical decompression of the facial nerve being required.

T1  - Retrograde mastoidectomy
AB  - The retrograde mastoidectomy technique with canal wall reconstruction is described as a primary treatment for modality for cholesteatoma. This synthesis of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) techniques involves removal of a portion of the canal wall for exposure and extirpation of the cholesteatoma, followed by reestablishment of the canal wall and ossicular chain during reconstruction. This technique is possible as a single stage in over 90% of cases, including children, with recurrence rates similar to CWD surgery, but with anatomic preservation similar to CWU. Recurrent disease occurred in 16% of cases reviewed in a longer term (8 year) follow-up study. Tobacco use was associated with a higher long-term complication rate. [References: 24]

T1  - A multivariate analysis of the factors predicting hearing outcome after surgery for cholesteatoma in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore factors influencing hearing outcomes in children treated by canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) mastoid surgery.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study including three units in Bristol and Bath, UK. Ninety consecutive children underwent cholesteatoma mastoid surgery, with the first procedure between 1998 and 2001; minimum follow up was three disease-free years.RESULTS: The CWU and CWD cohorts significantly differed in pre-operative stage and hearing. After disease eradication, air conduction (AC) thresholds changed by +4.0 dB (95 per cent confidence intervals (95% CI) -2.0, 10.1) in the CWD group and -5.3 dB (95% CI -9.3, 1.3) in the CWU group (p=0.029). Using multiple linear regression to account for cohort differences, AC thresholds were increased by: pre-operative AC threshold (p<0.0001), initial ossicular stage (p=0.013), and CWD-surgery (p=0.005).CONCLUSION: Disease-free hearing was better with CWU-surgery, less initial ossicular damage, and better pre-operative hearing. Worse initial disease increased the likelihood of CWD surgery. Wider use of ossiculoplasty in the CWU cohort (51 per cent vs 5 per cent) may partially explain the superior results.

T1  - Canal wall reconstruction and mastoid obliteration with composite multi-fractured osteoperiosteal flap
AB  - We used inferior pedicled composite multi-fractured osteoperiosteal flap (CMOF), our original and new surgical approach, to obliterate the mastoid cavity and reconstruct the external auditory canal (EAC) to prevent the open cavity problems. CMOF was used to obliterate the mastoid cavity and reconstruct the EAC in 24 patients (13 women, 11 men; age span 12-51 years) who underwent radical mastoidectomy to treat the chronic otitis media between 1998 and 2004. Small meatoplasty was done in all 24 patients to relieve their aesthetical concerns. Temporal bone CT scanning was done to observe the neo-osteogenesis in the mastoidectomy cavity and the CMOF, and the EAC volume was measured postoperatively. All our patients were followed-up for 2 years. The epithelization of the new EAC in our patients was complete at the end of the second month. Cholesteatoma, granulation, and recurrence of osteitis did not occur in any of the patients. We saw the new bone formation filling the mastoid cavity in the postoperative temporal bone CT scanning images. The mean volume of the new EAC on the 24th month was 1.83 +/- 0.56 cm(3). We had an almost natural EAC, which owed its existence to the neo-osteogenesis that grows behind the CMOF, which we use to obliterate the mastoid cavity and to reconstruct the EAC.

T1  - Obliteration of the tympanomastoid cavity: long term results of the Rambo operation
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Radical mastoidectomy and tympanomastoid obliteration with fat tissue, also called the Rambo operation, is proposed to those patients suffering chronic middle-ear disease, with or without cholesteatoma, who have no useful hearing in an ear which cannot be kept dry despite all conservative treatment.METHODS: We analysed retrospectively a series of 46 patients operated upon in our department. Information recorded included the surgical indications, surgical observations, post-operative care and complications. All patients were invited to comment on their long term anatomical and functional results and to express their degree of satisfaction with the procedure.RESULTS: Recurrent infectious episodes were observed in seven cases. Residual cholesteatoma were observed in three cases. After treatment, these patients did not present with further complications. One case presented with multiple episodes of infection with recurrences of cholesteatoma and finally had the obliterated cavity transformed into an open cavity again. For most of the patients, in the long term (i.e. one to 23 years post-operatively (mean eight years)), the operation resulted in a dry ear, ending the need for frequent consultations to clean and disinfect diseased ears or open cavities.CONCLUSION: Obliteration of the tympanomastoid cavity, as proposed by Tom Rambo, shortens considerably the post-operative care period, in comparison with canal wall down mastoidectomy, and is therefore indicated if no serviceable hearing can be expected. In the long term, the rate of complications is low and patients are satisfied.

T1  - Surgical treatment of pediatric cholesteatomas
AB  - OBJECTIVE: : Management of pediatric cholesteatomas remains controversial. We reviewed our 16-year experience in the surgical treatment of cholesteatomas in children and describe a treatment paradigm.STUDY DESIGN: : The authors conducted a retrospective review.METHODS: : A total of 106 mastoidectomies (86 for an acquired cholesteatoma and 20 for a congenital cholesteatoma) were performed in children 16 years old and younger from 1988 to 2003. Follow up ranged from 2 years to 12 years with a mean follow-up period of 6 years. Hearing outcomes, cholesteatoma recidivism, and dry mastoid cavity were the main outcomes measured.RESULTS: : Seven (7%) patients had revision surgery for cholesteatoma recidivism. Rates of cholesteatoma recurrence for canal all up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy groups were similar (8% vs. 6%). The percentage of patient with good serviceable hearing (pure-tone average </=25 dB) was higher in those with a CWU mastoidectomy as compared with the CWD mastoidectomy group (81% vs. 47%) (P < .05). Extent of disease and stapes superstructure erosion on presentation were significant (P < .05) predictors of both cholesteatoma recidivism and poor hearing. All 106 subjects studied had a dry mastoid and 78 patients (74%) had a maintenance-free cavity at the time the study was completed.CONCLUSION: : The treatment of pediatric cholesteatomas should be individualized with CWD mastoidectomy chosen for patients with recurrent or more extensive disease. We conclude that the CWU procedure is an adequate surgical option for treating most acquired and congenital cholesteatomas, preventing disease recurrence, and maintaining good hearing outcomes.

T1  - Long-term results with operated sinus tympani retraction cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Utilizing an endaural approach, we described the surgical treatment of 29 cases of sinus tympani retraction cholesteatoma in 1996. The purpose of this paper is to provide long-term results in this group of patients.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective chart analysis of 29 previously reported patients was undertaken in an effort to identify hearing results and the risk of cholesteatoma recurrence following sinus tympani retraction surgery.RESULTS: The follow-up period ranged from 9 to 16 years (mean of 13.2 years). Speech discrimination (SD) and conductive hearing (CH) decline occurred in 23 of 28 patients, but only on the average of 5.6% and 9 dB throughout the speech frequencies, respectively. Speech discrimination and conductive hearing improved in 5 of 28 patients; one patient was lost to follow-up. One patient developed a recurrent cholesteatoma requiring a canal wall-down mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: The endaural approach for sinus tympani cholesteatoma provided stable hearing in most of the patients in this series. One cholesteatoma recurrence required conversion to a canal wall-down mastoidectomy. This developed in a noncompliant patient, whose pars tensa retraction deepened as a result of failure to have his ventilation tube replaced. Semiannual office visits are recommended in patients who undergo this otologic approach for sinus tympani cholesteatoma.

T1  - Ceravital reconstruction of canal wall down mastoidectomy: long-term results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe long-term outcomes of external auditory canal wall reconstruction using bioactive glass ceramic (Ceravital) after canal wall down mastoidectomy.DESIGN: Retrospective review of a case series over a 21-year period, with a mean +/- SD follow-up of 13.1 +/- 6.7 years (range, 0.2-20.5 years).SETTING: Private otologic practice.PATIENTS: The study population comprised 20 consecutive patients aged 12 to 60 years, who had previously undergone canal wall down mastoidectomy.INTERVENTION: Reconstruction of the canal wall with bioactive glass ceramic.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence, cause, and timing of reconstruction failure; need for additional surgery; change in hearing; frequency of outpatient visits; and incidence of surgical complications.RESULTS: Prosthetic walls have remained intact in 16 patients followed for more than 5 years. One had remained intact at 3 months after surgery, but the patient was lost to follow-up. Prosthesis removal was required in 3 patients (because of infection, displacement, and cholesteatoma in 1 patient each). The only perioperative complications were otorrhea in 4 patients and a 5-dB sensorineural hearing loss in 1 patient. Of the 16 intact patients with long-term follow-up, 4 required no further surgery, while 11 underwent an average of 2 subsequent middle ear procedures each (range, 1-3), including 4 planned reexplorations. The mean +/- SD air bone gap improved 11 +/- 16 dB as of the most recent audiogram (mean +/- SD, 7.7 +/- 5.8 years after operation).CONCLUSION: Canal wall reconstruction using bioactive glass ceramic is a useful option for patients who desire freedom from the frequent mastoid bowl debridements and activity restrictions that may result from canal wall down mastoidectomy.

T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: experience at the University of Crete
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical and audiologic data as well as operative findings and postoperative follow-up in the management of chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media with canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM).STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review of cases followed up between 1990 and 2002.SETTING: Tertiary referral centre.METHOD: Two hundred one patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma underwent CWDM.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical presentation, surgical findings, and audiologic evaluation were assessed.RESULTS: Preoperatively, eight patients suffered from vertigo and four presented with facial nerve paralysis. In 40 patients (20%), erosion of the lateral semicircular canal was found, and in 31 patients (15%), there was dehiscence of the facial nerve canal. Dural plate erosion and sinus plate dehiscence were found in 13 and 17 patients, respectively. Nine patients experienced serious endocranial complications at their admission. The malleus was noted to be intact in the majority of patients in all age groups. The incus was eroded or absent in most of the cases in all age groups. On postoperative evaluation 3 months after surgery, 195 audiograms were performed, with a mean pure-tone average of 55 dB HL and a mean air-bone gap of 30 dB HL.CONCLUSION: Although CWDM has the disadvantages of the necessity to avoid water insertion in the external auditory canal and lifelong mastoid care, it is an effective treatment in a single-step procedure for patients with advanced disease and for those who refuse to submit to postoperative follow-up.

T1  - Revision chronic ear surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report results of revision chronic ear surgery following guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery and to establish expectations for infection and cholesteatoma control and hearing outcomes.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review of all patients who underwent revision chronic ear surgery from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2000. Revision chronic ear surgery included canal wall up and canal wall down procedures with ossicular chain reconstruction performed as needed. Cholesteatoma control, hearing improvement, and closure of middle ear space are main outcome measures.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.RESULTS: Cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 57% at 1 year after surgery and 14% in patients with a minimum of a 5-year follow-up. Disease control was achieved in 96% of patients. Hearing was significantly improved in all surgical groups. Closure of the air-bone gap for revision partial ossicular replacement prosthesis cases (PORP) to less than 20 dB occurred in 50% of patients. Closure of the air-bone gap to within 30 dB for revision total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) occurred in 60% of patients. Canal wall down status had a significant impact on hearing results after PORPs and TORPs; patients with intact canal walls had significantly better hearing results. Diagnosis of cholesteatoma significantly impacted hearing results for TORPs but not PORPS.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma control rates after revision surgery are similar to primary cases. Significant improvement in hearing can be expected after revision chronic ear surgery. Hearing results after a revision surgery that requires a PORP is worse than primary cases and is canal wall status dependent. Closure of the middle ear space and creation of a safe dry ear can be expected after revision chronic ear surgery.SIGNIFICANCE: This is a review of a large series of exclusively revision chronic ear surgery.Ebm rating: c-4.

T1  - Aural acquired cholesteatoma in children: surgical findings, recurrence and functional results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare clinical features, surgical findings and treatment results from children and adults affected by aural acquired cholesteatoma.METHODS: a retrospective review of 60 children (Group I: mean age 8.8 years, range 3-16 years) and 308 adults (Group II: mean age 45.4 years, range 18-81 years) with aural acquired cholesteatoma who underwent surgery from January 1992 to December 2002, was performed with a follow-up of 5 years. All patients were submitted to single-staged canal wall down tympanoplasty. Variables analysed were otoscopic features, extent of cholesteatoma, surgical findings and the rate of recidivism.RESULTS: The pathologic changes in the tympanic membrane were no different in the two groups. According to Stangerup et al. 40 cases (66.6%) of children were classified as stage III or more, with a significant higher incidence compared to adults (152 cases; 49.3%). Analysis of the ossicular chain state showed, in group I, a significant higher incidence of eroded or absent incus (76.6% versus 61.68%) and malleus (76.6% versus 56.48%), if compared to adults. Children, therefore, had a significantly higher risk of recurrence with a rate of 26.6% in Group I and 6.81% in group II. After surgery the mean gain measured in children group, was 11 dB and 13 dB in adults.CONCLUSION: In our study we found that the behaviour of cholesteatoma in children appears more aggressive than in adults. In fact, we found a greater extension of the cholesteatoma, a worse state of the ossicular chain and a higher incidence of recurrence. Therefore, we obtained acceptable hearing results both in children and in adults.

T1  - Indications for surgery in acute mastoiditis and their complications in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical charts of 45 paediatric patients treated for acute otomastoiditis at the ORL Department of the University of Brescia (Italy) between January 1994 and March 2005 and to discuss the diagnostic workup and the outcome of treatment.METHODS: Twenty-six males and 19 females were admitted with acute mastoiditis and subperiosteal abscess. Thirteen of them (28.9%) presented an intracranial complication. Only three of them were not operated upon; one received a ventilation tube (VT); all the others underwent a mastoidectomy within 48-72 h. Twenty out of 32 uncomplicated mastoiditis were treated conservatively and the remaining 12 underwent myringotomy+/-VT, associated with a mastoidectomy in 9 cases.RESULTS: Antibiotics alone or with VTs achieved a full recovery in 28 out of 32 uncomplicated cases. Mastoidectomy resolved the disease in 13 patients (9 with complications). In severe complications, a canal wall down (CWD) (n=2) or an intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy (n=7) were preferred, based on the extent of the lesions and the degree of hearing loss. All children recovered completely at 1 year follow-up. In the uncomplicated cases that were operated upon, the mean hospital stay was 7.8 days (versus 4.3 days for the conservative group). In children with intracranial complications the mean hospital stay was 12.8 days, significantly less than the four non-surgical patients, who remained hospitalized for an average of 18 days.CONCLUSION: Acute mastoiditis can fully recover with conservative treatment or myringotomy+VTs. Immediate surgical treatment is indicated for intracranial complications, if the neurological conditions are not critical. A simple mastoidectomy+/-tympanoplasty is warranted in: (1) exteriorization, if the child is older than 30 months or >15 kg of weight, (2) intracranial complications (combined with a neurosurgical procedure as needed) and (3) cholesteatoma or granulation tissue.

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma: a retrospective review
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The optimal treatment for pediatric cholesteatoma is controversial. Management decisions including intact canal wall versus open cavity techniques, second look procedures and staging ossicular reconstruction continue to be debated. In an attempt to clarify this issue we conducted an 11-year retrospective analysis of our experience with cholesteatoma presenting in our pediatric population.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of children undergoing surgical intervention for cholesteatoma at a tertiary care pediatric hospital between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 2003 by the senior author.METHODS: Comparison of recurrence rates in intact canal wall (ICW) versus canal wall down (CWD) procedures; with analysis of second-look procedures, ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) and hearing results in the management of pediatric cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-two children with 278 cases of cholesteatoma underwent surgical resection. Of these children, 221 were managed via an ICW approach while the remaining 57 underwent a CWD procedure. The overall recurrence rate in this series was 16%, with 17% in the ICW group and 12% in the CWD group. OCR was performed in 97% of the ICW cases at time of second-look procedure, with 75% undergoing reconstruction with partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis. The average air-bone gap improvement in these patients was 10.8 dB, with an average hearing improvement of total ossicular reconstruction of 5.8 dB. The average hearing improvement in the CWD group, all managed with cartilage interposition grafts, was 3.7 dB.CONCLUSIONS: Management of pediatric cholesteatoma requires a highly individualized approach that takes into account anatomic, clinical and social factors to determine the most successful surgical treatment paradigm.

T1  - Hearing results with the titanium ossicular replacement prostheses
AB  - The purpose was to study the hearing results in patients receiving a Kurz titanium Bell partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) or an Aerial total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP). The study was a retrospective chart review in a tertiary otologic referral center. A computerized otologic database was used to identify 111 patients implanted with either a PORP or TORP prosthesis. Audiograms were reviewed and air-bone gaps were calculated for each patient. The improvement of the average air-bone gap (ABG) was 10.2 and 12.7 dB at 3 and 20 months after ossiculoplasty, respectively. Sixty-six percent of patients (73/111) had a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or less. The ABG for the titanium PORP prosthesis was 14.3+/-9.7 dB, compared with 25.2+/-13.7 dB for the TORP prosthesis (P <0.05). The ABG to within 20 dB or less was obtained in the PORP group in 77% of the cases, versus 52% of the cases in the TORP group (P <0.05). Two extrusions of the prostheses were observed at 17 and 20 months after surgery (1.8%). Revision procedures for functional failure were carried out in 20 patients (18%). The rate of sensorineural hearing loss was 3.6%. The major factors influencing good audiometric results were the surgical procedure preserving the external auditory canal and the presence of the stapes. The best hearing results were achieved when a PORP was used in an intact canal wall (ICW) procedure, and the worst hearing results were achieved when a TORP was used in a canal wall down (CWD) procedure. The titanium Kurz prosthesis has been an effective implant at our institution for ossicular reconstruction.

T1  - [Tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma in pediatric patients]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the best strategy in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma in pediatric patient. Both intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (ICW) and canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (CWD) were the basic technique for cholesteatoma in pediatric patient. The outcomes of ICW and CWD as comparisons of different surgical technique were assessed.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric primary acquired cholesteatoma aged 4-14 years old between April, 1997 and October, 2003 was conducted. The follow-up information was completed. Forty-two patients (45 ears) were treated and followed from 1 to 7 years [ the average is (3.6 +/- 2. 6) years].RESULTS: ICW was the primary surgical treatment in 20 patients (20 ears) initially, the recidivism rate was 30% ( 6/20), the achieved rate of pure-tone threshold average (PTA) was 77% (13/17); Twenty-five (two) patients (45 ears) underwent CWD, the recidivism rate was 4% (1/25), the achieved rate of PTA was 72% (18/25).CONCLUSIONS: ICW had the advantage which could preserve the physical structure of the external acoustic meatus and had more profits for the treatment of cholesteatoma in pediatric patients, but it should be done for planned second stage surgery as a routine method that could get over the defect of recrudescence . If the function of eustachian tube was still not normal when planned second stage surgery operation was done, the CWD was suggested instead.

T1  - [Long-term results of functional surgery for attic cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the long-term results of functional surgery for attic cholesteatoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we presented the results of 81 patients (42 males 39 females; mean age 34 years; range 8 to 59 years) who underwent functional surgical techniques for attic cholesteatomas between January 1992 and January 1998. All the patients were followed-up for at least five years.RESULTS: For eradication of attic cholesteatoma, canal wall-down technique tympanoplasty was required in the majority of the patients. After surgery there was a statistically significant hearing improvement in all but four cases. In the postoperative period, residual cholesteatoma and graft perforation were found in five and six patients, respectively. Two patients required revision meatoplasty for problems related with cavity clearance.CONCLUSION: Apart from satisfactory hearing improvement with functional surgery, a successful self-clearance was obtained in mastoid cavities with saucerization and meatoplasty. Canal wall-down tympanoplasty is associated with very low incidences of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in the majority of patients.

T1  - Canal wall reconstruction tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the authors' experience with canal wall reconstruction (CWR) tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration in the treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Institutional review board approved retrospective case review.METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing CWR tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration from 1997 to 2004. Data included pre- and postoperative audiometry, findings at second look surgery with ossiculoplasty, and postoperative complications including wound infection and canal wall displacement.RESULTS: One hundred thirty ears in 127 adults and children underwent the procedure. Mean time postoperative was 48 (range 2-94) months. A second look ossiculoplasty was performed in 102 (78%). Percentage of ears that remain safe without evidence of recurrence was 98.5. The postoperative infection rate decreased from an initial rate of 14.3% to 4.5% for the last 88 ears after protocol modification. Recurrence occurred in two (1.5%) patients, requiring conversion to a canal wall down mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: A CWR technique can provide improved intraoperative exposure of the middle ear and mastoid without creating a mastoid bowl and reduces the incidence of recurrent disease. A single procedure is used for all patients with acquired cholesteatoma, including children.

T1  - [Studying the effect of surgery for cholesteatoma in children]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of surgical treatment on hearing for cholesteatoma in children.METHOD: The retrospective survey was carried out in 62 children with cholesteatoma treated surgically over a 5-year period. Sixty patients had acquired cholesteatoma and two had congenital cholesteatoma. Forty-eight patients had extensive invasion that required canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Twelve patients with attic cholesteatoma underwent canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and 2 patients with cholesteatoma localized to the middle-ear space were adequately treated with tympanic exploration.RESULT: Hearing was improved in 42 cases, preserved in 13 cases, became worse in 7 cases. A secondary surgical procedure for recidivistic (recurrent or residual) disease was performed in 3 cases. Facial paralysis was noted in 2 patients before surgical operation, and 2 patients had sensorineural hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma in children and demonstrated the need for careful preoperative evaluation, meticulous surgical technique, and prudent postoperative follow-up.

T1  - Intracranial abscesses associated with chronic suppurative otitis media
AB  - Intracranial abscesses are serious complications of chronic suppurative otitis media (COM). This study included 32 patients presenting with intracranial abscesses from 780 patients hospitalized for treatment of COM. The 32 patients had 59 intracranial complications. Perisinus abscess (13 of 32) was the most common intracranial abscess, followed by temporal lobe abscess (8 of 32), epidural abscess (7 of 32), cerebellar abscess (6 of 32) and subdural empyema (2 of 32). Headache (93%), fever (87%) and altered mental status (62%) were the most common presenting symptoms and signs, along with symptoms of COM. All patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics and canal wall down mastoidectomy. Cholesteatoma with granulation tissue and bony defects at the sinus plate and/or dural plate were seen in most of the patients. Gram negative bacilli and anaerobes were the most common organisms cultured from the abscesses. Three patients had neurological sequels. One patient died. The early diagnosis of these complications requires a high index of suspicion and imaging studies. A multidisciplinary and coordinated approach is important for the management of these patients.

T1  - Usefulness of delayed postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of residual cholesteatoma after canal wall-up tympanoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Imaging takes an increasing place in the follow-up of patients who have undergone surgery for cholesteatoma, with computed tomography (CT) as the first line imaging technique. However, in case of complete opacity of the tympanomastoid cavities, CT is not able to differentiate residual cholesteatoma from postoperative scar tissue. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images for the detection of residual cholesteatoma after canal wall-up tympanoplasty (CWU) in cases where CT was not conclusive.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study.METHODS: MRI, with delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images (30-45 minutes after contrast injection), was performed before revision surgery in 41 consecutive patients who had undergone CWU for cholesteatoma and presenting with a nonspecific complete opacity of the mastoid bowl on CT. In all the cases, imaging results were compared with operative findings at surgical revision.RESULTS: A residual cholesteatoma was found in 19 of 41 patients at revision surgery and was correctly detected on MRI in 17 patients. In the two remaining cases, cholesteatoma pearls smaller than 3 mm were not seen. There was no false-positive case. Statistics were as follows: sensitivity 90%; specificity 100%; positive predictive value 100%; negative predictive value 92%.CONCLUSION: When postoperative CT is not conclusive because of complete opacity of the tympanomastoid cavities, MRI with delayed postcontrast T1-weighted images is a reliable additional technique for the detection of a residual cholesteatoma when its diameter is at least 3 mm.

T1  - Surgical management of sinus tympani cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study is to describe the extension of unsafe middle ear disease in the sinus tympani and to review the methods of surgical access to remove the disease from this area.METHODS: Of the 164 operated ears with unsafe chronic suppurative otitis media 64(39%) ears had variable disease extension into the sinus tympani and were included in the study. Sixty two ears underwent canal wall down (CWD) procedure while remaining two underwent tympanoplasty with bone work.RESULT: Five operated ears had deeper extension of the disease into the sinus tympani. And despite of different maneuver the complete removal of the disease could not be confirmed. Six ears (9.4%) had recidivism.CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes on the greater incidence of this disease extension into this difficult anatomical area and their complete removal may not be always possible. But one should require thorough knowledge and surgical expertise to work in this difficult area of posterior mesotympanum.

T1  - Anatomic and functional long-term results of canal wall-down mastoidectomy
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, over the long-term, the anatomic and functional outcome of canal wall-down mastoidectomy performed for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and chronic otomastoiditis resistant to all conservative treatment. The study was made through a retrospective review of 338 cases of consecutive primary canal wall-down mastoidectomies performed between 1974 and 1998. Included were 259 cases with sufficient data. In all cases, functional reconstruction was performed at the same time as the mastoidectomy. Demographic and clinical data were collected from each file. From the clinical data, the surgical techniques, complications, the number of follow-up visits necessary to ensure cavity cleanliness, details of care provided over the period 1 to 24 years (mean, 7 years) after the operation, and audiometric data from admission and from the latest postoperative follow-up were retained. Canal wall-down mastoidectomies were followed up an average of 10 times during the first 6 months after operation, twice a year over the 6-year period following surgery, and less than twice a year beyond the 6-year period. Care was dispensed for meatal stenosis, scars, infections, polyps, and beads of cholesteatoma. Surgical revisions were performed because of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in 6.1% of the cases, because of perforation of the tympanic membrane in 7.3% of the cases, and to improve hearing in 12.2% of the cases. At the last consultation, 1 to 24 years after surgery, cavities were found to be dry and self-cleaning in 95% of the cases, and still humid, with otorrhea, in 5% of the cases. Over the long-term, the hearing threshold remained unchanged in 41.3% of the cases. It was improved after surgery by 10 to 19 dB in 15.4% of the cases, by 20 to 29 dB in 11.5% of the cases, and by more than 29 dB in 3.8% of the cases. The hearing threshold was thus improved or at least remained unchanged in 72.0% of cases. Hearing losses occurred in 28% of the cases: by 10 to 19 dB in 11.9%, by 20 to 29 dB in 6.5%, and by more than 29 dB in 9.2% of the cases. A sensorineural hearing loss of more than 60 dB at all frequencies occurred immediately after the operation in 2 cases (0.7%). There was 1 case of facial paralysis (0.3%). Four patients (1.5%) complained of persistent vertigo. Canal wall-down mastoidectomy is an adequate treatment for chronic otitis with cholesteatoma or chronic otomastoiditis. The anatomic and functional results are satisfactory, and the rate of complications is acceptably low. A tympanoplasty can be performed simultaneously. Thus, for the large majority of patients, only a single intervention is required; however, a small minority can benefit from a revision tympanoplasty. In order to obtain these results, both the patient and the surgeon should engage in a long-term follow-up.

T1  - Preliminary functional results of tympanoplasty with titanium prostheses
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of titanium prostheses in tympanoplasty for reconstruction of the sound pressure and to evaluate the audiometric results obtained.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: and patients Retrospective chart review in a tertiary referral center. Between September 1998 and October 2000, 23 titanium middle ear implants (23 TORP) were used for reconstruction of the ossicular chain after tympanomastoidectomy. Preliminary functional results were obtained in 23 cases.RESULTS: Average follow-up time was 18 months (range, 12-40) and no adverse reactions or extrusions occurred. Seven of 16 canal wall down tympanoplasties (43.7%), and 3 of 7 canal wall up tympanoplasties performed (42.9%) had a postoperative air-bone gap of between 0 and 10 dB.CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that titanium prosthesis provide a promising hearing result after total ossicular reconstruction, although long-term results are not yet available. The low weight of these prostheses may be the reason for the decrease in the air-bone gap.

T1  - When can lateral sinus thrombosis be treated conservatively?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to review the clinical manifestations, radiologic findings, and treatment modalities of our cases with lateral sinus thrombosis (LST).METHOD: Documents of patients with LST, diagnosed and treated from 1995 to 2001 in our clinic, were examined retrospectively.RESULTS: Four patients with the diagnosis of LST were treated during this period. Among the clinical manifestations of these patients, the most frequently encountered symptoms were earache and headache, in addition to otorrhea and hearing loss. Four cases had chronic otitis media, three with cholesteatoma and one with polyps. Delta sign was detected in three cases on computed tomography, whereas a suspicious image was noted in one case. This case underwent magnetic resonance angiography, and the diagnosis of LST was established conclusively. In two cases, because pus was aspirated via lateral sinus punctures performed intraoperatively, these sinuses were explored and obliterated following radical mastoidectomy. Because pus was not aspirated via punctures of the other two cases, their sinuses were not explored. Only radical mastoidectomy was performed surgically for these cases. Dual antibiotics and low-dose anticoagulant therapy were given concomitantly to all cases in the postoperative period. Recanalizations of the nonobliterated lateral sinuses were detected with Doppler ultrasonography of internal jugular vena at 15 days and 3 months after the termination of postoperative treatment.CONCLUSION: Clinical findings and radiologic techniques play an important role in the diagnosis of LST. In the treatment, if pus is found in the lateral sinuses, it is necessary to explore, clean, and obliterate them, whereas in cases in which the aspirates do not contain pus, mastoidectomy is sufficient. On the other hand, a low dose of anticoagulant can be used together with antibiotics in the nonobliterated lateral sinuses.

T1  - The role of the KTP laser in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary aim in cholesteatoma surgery is the removal of the disease. As a result, most residual disease is found in sites which are both adjacent to the ossicles and hidden from direct view. An ideal instrument should be able to remove disease without movement and should be able to remove disease from regions to which there is no direct access. The laser fullfills this criteria.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ears which underwent canal wall-up cholesteatoma surgery without the laser were compared with ears which underwent surgery which included the KTP laser since 1991.RESULTS: A total of 514 procedures was analysed (313 without laser and 201 with laser). We obtained respectively 83 (26.5%) and 21 (10.4%) residual disease (P < 0.0001). The procedures involving the KTP laser resulted in no cases of facial nerve injury and no cases of total sensorineural hearing loss.CONCLUSION: We can conclude that the appropriately use of the KTP laser during cholesteatoma surgery does improve significantly the complete removal of disease and presents no extra risk to the vital structures within the temporal bone.

T1  - Closed tympanoplasty in middle ear cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of closed tympanoplasty surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma and to compare the postoperative results with the outcomes of canal-wall-down mastoidectomy.METHODS: Seventy patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were involved in the study. Pneumo-otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry, anamnestic and clinical data were evaluated before the surgery. Modified radical mastoidectomy was performed for 31 patients. Thirty-nine patients were treated with closed tympanoplasty surgery, including intact canal wall mastoidectomy, endaural atticotomy, lateral attic and aditus wall reconstruction and tympanoplasty. The follow-up examination was carried out 12 months after the surgery. The recurrence of cholesteatoma, otorrhea and hearing level were evaluated postoperatively.RESULTS: Otorrhea was estimated in 4 cases (10.3%) after closed tympanoplasty surgery and in 6 cases (19.4%) after modified radical mastoidectomy. Among the patients who were operated using closed tympanoplasty technique the middle ear cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 12.8% and among those, who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy recurrent disease occurred in 9.7% of the cases. The hearing improvement was found in 15 cases (38.46%) after closed tympanoplasty, while there was no hearing improvement after modified radical mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that despite the fact, that cholesteatoma recurrence rate after closed tympanoplasty is relatively high, this surgical method permits to preserve adequate hearing level and releases from postoperative cavity care problems as compared with modified radical mastoidectomy.

T1  - Biphasic ceramics and fibrin sealant for bone reconstruction in ear surgery
AB  - Bone reconstruction is still a matter of concern in middle ear surgery despite the large number of surgical techniques proposed. A composite made of biphasic calcium phosphate ceramic granules mixed with human fibrin sealant, forming a moldable material that is easy to set for bone reconstruction, has been used with success over a 16-year period for reconstruction of the posterior canal wall or for mastoid obliteration. In a retrospective series of 72 ears with long-term follow-up (average follow-up of 46 months), regular microscopic examination, and computed tomographic controls, we have evaluated this bone reconstruction technique for radical mastoidectomy cavities or the closed technique. The bone reconstruction material provided an immediate anatomic reconstruction that remains stable and is well tolerated over the long term. A slight leakage of granules in the meatus was initially observed in several patients with transient aseptic otorrhea. Fifty-seven ears were followed up for 1 year or more. Satisfactory clinical results with complete regression of the mucous membrane disease were found in 82.4% of the patients, with perfect stability of the material in 65%. We did not observe any cases of recurrent cholesteatoma in or behind the filling material. Eighteen biopsies were performed between 8 and 84 months after surgery during a second surgical step performed for functional purposes or for recurrent cholesteatoma; 17 of the 18 cases showed osteointegration of the filling material. After a 16-year experiment, we consider this technique to be a highly satisfactory procedure that could be extended to other situations of bone reconstruction.

T1  - Congenital cholesteatoma
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Congenital cholesteatomas have historically been considered a rare disorder. However, a review of the literature reveals an incidence ranging from 4 to 24%, and these values are probably underestimated. This article summarizes the general diagnostic criteria of congenital cholesteatomas, their usual presenting symptoms and findings, perioperative studies, a proposed staging system to assist with predicting postoperative outcomes, general surgical procedures, and recidivism rates.RECENT FINDINGS: Congenital cholesteatomas have been defined as evidencing no prior history of otorrhea, tympanic perforation, or previous otologic procedures; a normal pars flaccida and tensa; and a pearly white mass medial to the tympanic membrane. Their cause remains controversial; however, the epithelial rest theory is most commonly accepted. The incidence of this disorder seems to be on the rise; however, this may be a result of increased awareness and reporting. The most common sites of presentation on physical examination are the anterior-superior and posterior-superior quadrants of the tympanic membrane. Conductive hearing loss is the most common presenting symptom. There is a lack of uniformity of reporting and classifying congenital cholesteatomas. Staging systems have recently been proposed. One in particular is reported and correlates with outcomes of treatment. Treatment of congenital cholesteatomas is still surgical. A comparison is made between canal wall up and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy for the treatment of nonlocalized cholesteatoma pearls. Postoperative hearing results are associated with the status of the ossicular chain perioperatively.SUMMARY: Heightened awareness and early diagnosis of congenital cholesteatomas is imperative. Early treatment decreases the extent of the disease and reduces the risk of recidivism and complications. Management of this disease is surgical. Preoperative computed tomography should be considered to assist in preoperative planning and prediction of postoperative issues. Consideration of a standard staging system and classification is important for consistent reporting and comparison. [References: 43]

T1  - Impact of mastoidectomy on simple tympanic membrane perforation repair
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Mastoidectomy has long been identified as an effective method of treatment for chronic ear infection. The effect of mastoidectomy on patients without evidence of active infectious disease remains highly debated and unproven. The objective in the study was to examine the impact of mastoidectomy on the repair of uncomplicated tympanic membrane perforations.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients at tertiary referral center.METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four patients who underwent surgical repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. Simple tympanic membrane perforations were defined as tympanic membrane perforations of any size and location without any of the following confounding variables: 1). active infection (active otorrhea, abnormal middle ear mucosa, or granulations tissue); 2). ossicular abnormalities (ossicular fixation, ossicular discontinuity, ossicular malformation, or ossicular absence); 3). cholesteatoma; or 4). prior attempt at tympanic membrane repair (prior tympanoplasty or mastoidectomy). Surgical outcome and clinical course were assessed to compare results of tympanic membrane perforation repair with and without canal wall up mastoidectomy.RESULTS: Tympanic membrane repair was equally effective in both groups at 91%. Hearing results were comparable. Development of persistent ipsilateral otological disease requiring a subsequent ipsilateral procedure was approximately twice as common in the tympanoplasty group. In the tympanoplasty group, 14.1% of patients underwent subsequent ipsilateral otological procedures, and 6.1% of patients in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy intact canal wall group underwent subsequent ipsilateral procedures (P <.05). The most common subsequent ipsilateral procedures were tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube placement, tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall up, and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall down, in that order. After including untreated tympanic membrane perforations as subsequent procedures, the adjusted rate of subsequent procedures was 15.5% in the tympanoplasty group and 12.2% in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy group (P >.05).CONCLUSION: Mastoidectomy was not necessary for successful repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations. However, mastoidectomy impacted the clinical course in patients by reducing the number of patients requiring future procedures and by decreasing disease progression. This suggests that even in the absence of active evidence of infection, mastoidectomy improved the underlying disease process. Combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty during repair of simple perforations in patients with no active evidence of infection remains an appropriate option and may be valuable in reducing the need for future surgery.

T1  - Canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction for middle-ear cholesteatoma: post-operative hearing, cholesteatoma recurrence, and status of re-aeration of reconstructed middle-ear cavity
AB  - The post-operative outcome of hearing, the reconstructed external auditory canal, and the state of the reconstructed middle-ear cavity after canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal and attico-antrum reconstruction was studied in 103 ears with middle-ear cholesteatoma. The reconstructed mastoid cavity was re-aerated in 36.5 per cent of the cases, which was significantly lower than for the epitympanum (63.5 per cent) and tympanic cavity (82.4 per cent). Tympanoplasty was successful in terms of hearing results in 68.9 per cent of all subjects and in 75.4 per cent of the ears having a re-aerated tympanic cavity, which was significantly better than the 38.5 per cent for ears in which the tympanic cavity was not re-aerated. The findings of recurrent cholesteatoma, tympanic atelectasis, and tympanic effusion were observed with significantly (p<0.03) high incidence in ears with no re-aerated space in their reconstructed mastoid cavities. It was revealed that the post-operative outcome of this surgical technique was significantly related to the state of re-aeration of the reconstructed middle-ear cavity.

T1  - Reversible canal wall down mastoidectomy for acquired cholesteatomas: preliminary results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The educational objectives were to discuss a new technique to manage acquired cholesteatomas and to compare this with standard approaches used for cholesteatoma removal. The study objective was to determine the feasibility of using a new approach, the reversible canal wall down approach, in conjunction with bone cement to remove acquired cholesteatomas and, potentially, preserve the ossicular chain.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of five patients who underwent resection of their acquired cholesteatomas using a technique that maximizes exposure, yet preserves the posterior canal wall and, potentially, the ossicular chain.METHODS: In the setting of a tertiary otological referral center, five consecutive patients with acquired cholesteatomas underwent reversible canal wall down surgery. Four patients were male (ages, 41, 53, 26, and 10 y), and one patient was a woman [age, 51 y]). A reversible canal wall down mastoidectomy approach was used in the patients. Main outcome measures were intraoperative findings with respect to cholesteatoma removal and postoperative clinical examination, including postoperative audiograms.RESULTS: Five patients had dry ears postoperatively. One patient initially had granulation tissue forming on the posterior ear canal. This eventually resolved. The patients who had a postoperative audiogram after cholesteatoma resection with ossicular chain preservation noted an improvement or stabilization in their hearing.CONCLUSIONS: Using the reversible canal wall down approach in conjunction with bone cement, one is able to obtain excellent exposure of the cholesteatoma and, potentially, preserve the ossicular chain. This approach may be particularly useful in revision cholesteatoma surgery or in cases of acquired cholesteatoma in which the surgeon may be able to preserve the ossicular chain.

T1  - Efficacy of the 2-staged procedure in the management of cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the efficacy of intact canal wall procedure coupled with a second-stage exploration for the treatment of cholesteatoma.DESIGN: Retrospective case study of patients with cholesteatomas treated with staged surgical extirpation. A minimum of 6 months' postoperative follow-up time was required for inclusion into the study.SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center. Patients A total of 35 adult and pediatric patients, ranging from 9 to 65 years of age, who underwent 2-stage procedures for removal of cholesteatomas.INTERVENTIONS: Two-stage procedures, separated by 6 months, performed with posterior tympanotomy approaches.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence or absence of cholesteatoma on second-stage look and the subsequent surgical treatment for recurrent cholesteatoma. The overall hearing results after the completion of the 2-staged procedure were calculated.RESULTS: Disease was controlled in 26 (74%) of the patients. Residual and/or recurrent cholesteatomas were found in 9 (26%) of the patients during the second-stage operation. Of these patients, 5 (14% of the total group) ultimately required conversion to canal-wall-down procedure. Average hearing gain at the completion of the second-stage procedure was 9 dB.CONCLUSIONS: A planned 2-stage procedure that uses the posterior tympanotomy approach for the control of cholesteatoma is an effective technique. This approach offers significant potential for hearing preservation and restoration.

T1  - [Sinus tympani in surgery of the middle ear and skull base]
AB  - Tympanic sinus is located at the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It's visualisation is difficult from most of approaches. Tympanic sinus is often filled with cholesteatoma in course of chronic otitis. Intraoperative assessment of tympanic sinus was performed in 29 patients with facial recess cholesteatoma, and in 20 patients with acoustic neuroma operated with translabyrinthine approach. In the group of patients with cholesteatoma four patients underwent canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy, 25 underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty. Tympanic sinus was assessed during surgery with 30 degrees endoscope. In all cases depth of the sinus was measured with the use of calibrated hook. In 11 patients depth of the sinus exceeded 4 mm. In 6 among these features of bone destruction was found.

T1  - Management of cholesteatoma: status of the canal wall
AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Management of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma remains controversial. The purpose of the study is to examine factors associated with the surgical approach to manage cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review.METHODS: A retrospective review was made of all primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma performed at an otological center between 1995 and 2000. During the study period, 486 ears underwent surgery for cholesteatoma. Data included procedures performed, location and extent of the disease, residual and recurrent disease, complications, reasons for staging the surgery, and duration of follow-up.RESULTS: The canal wall remained intact in 68.5% of ears. The majority of the remainder of the patients underwent a canal wall down technique with mastoid obliteration. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 26.9% of second procedures and in 2.7% of third procedures.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with cholesteatoma can be adequately managed with a canal intact tympanomastoidectomy with staging. Otolaryngologists should consider a two-staged procedure as a viable management approach for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.

T1  - [Clinical investigation on anacusis associated with chronic suppurative otitis media]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors and clinical features of anacusis or severe deafness associated with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM ).METHOD: A retrospective review of 62 ears consecutive cases of severe deafness (15 ears) and anacusis (47 ears) associated with CSOM were investigated . There were 5 ears severe deafness deteriorated to anacusis after procedures. This represented 6.42% of our total series of CSOM with or without cholesteatoma in adults and children (965 ears) in 1993-2000. The series with cholesteatoma or granuloma or tympanosclerosis were 46 (74.19%) ears 13 (20.97%) ears and 3 (4.84%) ears respectively. The symptoms and operative findings were analyzed. All patients underwent preoperative CT scans and preoperative audiometry. With respect to surgical technique, the canal-wall-down procedure was performed in(50/62) 80.6%, and classical modified mastoidectomy was performed in(12/62) 19.4%.RESULT: The results demonstrated that chronic otorrhea with bloody, ossicular chain destructive and erosion of the supraplate structure or disappear of footplate were helpful predicting indicators for anacusis or severe deafness. There was a high significant association (Chi-square Fisher exact test P < 0. 001) with these factors compared with CSOM without anacusis or severe deafness. Labyrinthine fistula was also correlated to anacusis or severe deafness (P < 0.05). There were no significant with the courses and facial paralysis and revision mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: Anacusis or severe deafness intimately associated with chronic otorrhea with bloody, ossicular chain destructive, erosion of the supraplate structure or disappear of footplate and labyrinthine fistula. The surgical procedure should be performed earlier to eradicate the chronic or acute infection and to avoid anacusis or severe deafness.

T1  - [Tympanic-ossicular reconstruction. Functional results using cartilage palisades and titanium prostheses]
AB  - The Eustachian tube disfunction and abnormalities in gas exchange through the middle ear mucosa may produce negative pressure and retraction pockets, adhesions, atelectasis and cholesteatomas. If this problem is present postoperatively, it may again lead to retraction, reperforation, and/or extrusion of the reconstructed ossicular chain. This applies especially if conventional autologous material, such as fascia and perichondrium, are used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. This paper reviews the indications, surgical technique, and functional results of 23 tympanoplasties using cartilage and titanium prostheses, with range follow-up of 20-55 months and a mean of 30 months. Seven out of sixteen canal wall down (43.7%) and three out seven canal wall up (42.9%) had a postoperative air-bone gap between 0 and 10 dB.

T1  - Mastoid-obliteration surgery with cartilage for suppurative cholesteatomatous ears
AB  - BACKGROUND: Autologous cartilage has been widely used as a material for tympanoplasty and mastoid-obliteration surgery. Since it remains vulnerable to an infectious condition, this study aims to evaluate if it can be used for a chronic suppurative cholesteatomatous ear to achieve single-stage tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy and obliteration of the cavity.METHODS: From January 1988 to August 1998, the records of patients with cholesteatoma who received cartilage-obliteration surgery performed by Dr. Lien were examined for any infection-associated problems within three months after the operation. The Fisher's exact test was used to compare the difference in the incidence of post-operative infection-associated problems between suppurative ears and non-suppurative ears.RESULTS: One hundred and seven surgical procedures performed upon 96 patients were included in this study, with 97 being primary surgical procedures and ten being revision surgery for previous open cavity with cholesteatoma recurrences. The average follow-up was 47.7 months. At time of surgery, there were 59 non-suppurative ears; 48 ears were suppurative and cultured. Granulations were found in the middle ear or mastoid for 42 ears (39.3%). Five ears (4.7%) exhibited infection-associated post-operative problems within three post-operative months. Three cases (5.1%) were non-suppurative ears and two cases (4.2%) were suppurative ears. There was no significant statistical difference when examined with the Fisher's Exact test.CONCLUSIONS: In an immunocompetent patient with a cholesteatomatous chronic suppurative ear, autologous cartilage could potentially tolerate an infection condition to serve as a material for mastoid-obliteration in a single-stage surgical procedure.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media: recurrent-residual disease and hearing
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgical approach, intact canal wall (ICW) or canal wall down (CWD), upon the success of revision surgery for chronic otitis media (COM). A retrospective analysis of 367 patients (including 65 children aged <15 years) who underwent revision tympanoplasty because of persistent disease was performed. Single-staged tympanoplasty was performed, preserving the canal wall when present. Hearing was reconstructed with allograft incus. Follow-up ranged from one to 15 years. Hearing was determined by pre- and post-operative air-bone gaps. Post-operative re-perforation, aural discharge and/or cholesteatoma rates were similar for CWD and ICW. Cholesteatoma could present following the revision, even though it was not apparent at surgery. Following tympanoplasty, the final hearing was not significantly affected by the surgical approach or presence of cholesteatoma. Improvement in hearing was adversely affected by cholesteatoma or an absent stapes suprastructure. Revision ICW and CWD operations were both successful in controlling signs of COM. Cholesteatoma is a peripheral risk in COM and may become apparent after revision surgery.

T1  - Management of chronic otitis media in the only hearing ear
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic ear surgery is difficult. The management of such a disease either with or without cholesteatoma and in an only hearing ear is particularly challenging. Consequences of disease or unintended outcomes of therapy can both result in patient lifestyle alterations of major proportion. This report offers a diagnostic and treatment plan for chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear.METHODS: More than 10,000 charts of patients with chronic otitis media were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven charts of patients with chronic otitis media in an only hearing ear who underwent surgical treatment were identified. The patients were followed for an average time of 43 months.RESULTS: Overall, the chronic otitis media was well controlled, and there was no change in the average discrimination or hearing thresholds when comparing preoperative and postoperative results.CONCLUSIONS: Chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma in an only hearing ear can be treated successfully with hearing preservation. Canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy is performed in most cases. Manipulation of the ossicular chain is avoided, and cholesteatoma that lies over a potential fistula is exteriorized.

T1  - Otitis media in Greenland. Studies on historical, epidemiological, microbiological, and immunological aspects
AB  - This thesis describes the different aspects of otitis media (OM) in the population of Greenland viewed in a historical and modern clinical perspective. Chapter 1 outlines the addressed problems and aims while chapters 2 and 3 deal with historical studies and an evaluation of the present knowledge based on the literature. Physical anthropological studies, using skeletal samples of adult Eskimo crania from before and after the colonization of Greenland in 1721 and information about modern living Eskimos (Inuit), have shown that OM sequelae of the temporal bones were significantly less common in pre-colonization Eskimos and that the mean area size of the pneumatized cell system in the temporal bone was significantly larger in pre-colonization Eskimos. These findings indicated an increase in OM after the colonization most likely caused by the social, cultural, habitary, and dietary changes due to increased contact with the outside world. Historical reports after the colonization confirm a high prevalence of OM especially in children. Modern epidemiological studies from the 1960's to 1980's in the Arctic region of Alaska, Canada, and Greenland along with reports from visiting consultant otologists in Greenland almost uniformly mention prevalent OM problems in children as well as in adults. The aim was therefore to further describe the epidemiological pattern of the different OM disease entities (acute OM (AOM), chronic OM (COM), COM with suppuration (CSOM), secretory OM (SOM), and cholesteatoma) and investigate the potentially associated risk factors in especially Greenlandic children because these diseases are primarily established and problematical in childhood. Chapter 4 describes the definitions used in the thesis and chapter 5 describes the studies included. Section 5.1 describes a study of cholesteatoma in Greenlanders. The study revealed an almost similar incidence of hospital treated children with cholesteatoma (6.6 per 100,000) as seen in comparable studies from other parts of the world. Furthermore, childhood cholesteatomas were the most aggressive. The frequency of residuals or recurrences after otosurgical treatment was high with a trend for better results when using the extensive canal wall-down procedure. It could be concluded that these patients urgently need close follow-up for at least five years postoperatively, if not lifelong. Section 5.2 describes a hearing screening survey of 167 school children using school registration charts. A high prevalence of hearing loss (HL) was found. A total of 43% of the children had hearing thresholds exceeding 20 dB at one or more frequencies between 250-8000 Hz in one or both ears, and 19% had the same type of HL in the frequencies 500-2000 Hz. HL was significantly associated with episodes of OM. These findings were in accordance with reports from Alaska and Canada. It is therefore concluded that a hearing screening programme of school children is important and that OM seems to have an impact on hearing in school children in Greenland. In section 5.3 an epidemiological survey is described concerning the prevalence of the different OM disease entities. The survey was carried out in Nuuk and Sisimiut and involved 740 children aged 3, 4, 5, and 8 years. A total of 591 children participated and selection bias was not found when controlling for age, sex, and episodes of AOM. The survey revealed that 52% of children in Nuuk and 54% in Sisimiut had some kind of pathological affection of their middle ear. COM and CSOM were found in 9%, but more prevalent among children in Sisimiut (12%) than in Nuuk (7%). Middle ear effusion (MEE) diagnosed by tympanometry was found in 23% in Nuuk and 28% in Sisimiut while simple tubal dysfunction (STD) was found in 13% and 8%, respectively. MEE and STD were associated with young age. Sequelae of OM was apparent in 11% in both towns. When comparing the results with a 10-year-older, almost similar survey of 142 children, it was evident that the OM situation had not changed in the period between the studies. The survey underlines the need for

T1  - Detection of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in human cholesteatomas and functional implications of correlations to recurrence status and to expression of matrix metalloproteinases-3/9, retinoic acid receptor-beta, and anti-apoptotic galectin-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the expression of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 1) is detectable, 2) changes in relation to recurrence and infection status, and 3) relates to the levels of expression of growth regulators/differentiation markers, including galectin-1, -3, and -8, retinoid acid receptors (RAR)]-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, binding sites for sarcolectin, and invasion markers (cathepsins -B and -D, and matrix metalloproteinases [MMP]-2, -3, and -9) in human cholesteatomas.STUDY DESIGN: An analysis of 56 cholesteatomas resected by the same surgeon using canal wall up and canal wall down surgical procedures.METHODS: The immunohistochemical levels of expression of MIF and the proteases were quantitatively determined (using computer-assisted microscopy) on routine histologic slides by specific antibodies, and statistically correlated to parameters of the other markers determined previously in conjunction with data on apoptosis/proliferation.RESULTS: MIF expression was detected. It was significantly higher in the epithelium (P =.002) and vessels (P =.04) of the connective tissues (but not in the connective tissue itself) of recurrent as opposed to non-recurrent cholesteatomas. The MIF expression is significantly correlated (P =.006) to the RAR beta expression in non-infected cholesteatomas, and to MMP-3 (P <.01) and anti-apoptotic galectin-3 (P =.01) in infected cholesteatomas. The level of MIF expression was also correlated significantly to MMP-9 (P = 0.003), RAR beta (P <.001), and galectin-8 (P =.003) expression in the cholesteatomas regardless of their infection status.CONCLUSIONS: MIF expression in human cholesteatomas is related to the levels of biologic aggressiveness reflected in their recurrence status and MMP expression, and to the differentiation status reflected in their galactin and RAR beta expressions. Together with galectin-3, it could cooperate to form an anti-apoptotic feedback loop.

T1  - The levels of expression of galectin-3, but not of galectin-1 and galectin-8, correlate with apoptosis in human cholesteatomas
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether galectins 1, 3, and 8 are expressed in human cholesteatomas and whether any such expression does correlate with the level of apoptosis, which is, as we have previously shown, predictive of recurrence.7STUDY DESIGN: The analysis of 52 cholesteatomas resected by the same surgeon by means of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures.METHODS: The immunohistochemical levels of expression of galectins 1, 3, and 8 were quantitatively determined (using computer-assisted microscopy) on conventional histological slides by means of specific anti-galectin-1, anti-galectin-3, and anti-galectin-8 antibodies. The level of apoptosis in each cholesteatoma under study had already been determined 7 by means of the in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (Tolt-mediated dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] staining).RESULTS: Galectin-1 was expressed markedly in both the epithelial and the connective tissue areas of all the cholesteatomas under study. The levels of expression of galectin-3 and galectin-8 were considerably lower than that of galectin-1. The level of expression of galectin-3 correlated both highly and positively with the level of apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: An upregulation of galectin-3 (known to have an antiapoptotic and antianoikis effect in certain model systems) expression, which is associated with pronounced apoptotic activity, could have a physiologically protective effect against the characteristically substantial apoptotic features occurring in recurrent cholesteatomas.

T1  - [Long-term results of canal wall down mastoidectomy]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the anatomical and functional long-term results of canal wall down mastoidectomy.METHOD: We analyse the results of 259 primary, one stage canal wall down mastoidectomies with type III, IV or V ossiculoplasty performed between 1974 and 1998. The indication for surgery was chronic active otitis with cholesteatoma or resistant to conservative treatment.RESULTS: In the long term, 1-24 (mean 7) years after surgery, 95% of the ears showed a dry, self-cleaning cavity and were disease-free. Hearing was preserved or improved in 70% of cases. Surgical revision due to of residual cholesteatoma was necessary in 16 cases (6%). The number of postoperative outpatient visits necessary to treat multiple minor problems was up to 10 visits per patient during the first 6 months after surgery and then gradually decreased over the years.DISCUSSION: The results achieved with canal wall down mastoidectomy are satisfactory in the long term, but the cavities required a high degree of postoperative outpatient care.

T1  - Canal-wall-down tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for advanced cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review 8.5 years of the senior author's experience with canal-wall-down mastoid surgery for extensive cholesteatoma with high-grade atelectasis and severely destructed ossicles.DESIGN: A retrospective review was conducted.SETTING: The setting was a tertiary care medical centre.METHODS: Available records consulted included 104 canal-wall-down mastoidectomy for advanced-stage cholesteatomas between July 1984 and December 1992.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrence, hearing results, and dry ear rate were analyzed.RESULTS: The recurrence rate was 4 of 104 (3.8%), and 9.6% of subjects suffered from recurrent otorrhea. Thirty-seven of 104 (35.6%) achieved the closure of air-bone gap within 20 dB. The availability of stapes suprastructure influenced the postoperative hearing level significantly (p < .001).CONCLUSION: Even in treating advanced cholesteatoma, canal-wall-down mastoidectomy provides a low recurrence rate, establishes a high dry ear rate, and preserves adequate hearing when the stapes suprastructure is available for reconstruction.

T1  - Retrograde mastoidectomy with canal wall reconstruction: a single-stage technique for cholesteatoma removal
AB  - The goal of this retrospective study was to report the preliminary results of the retrograde mastoidectomy technique with canal wall reconstruction used as a primary treatment method for cholesteatoma. This synthesis of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) techniques was performed in 70 patients (75 ears; 35 pediatric, 40 adult) with an average 45-month follow-up. Surgical intervention involved removal of a portion of the canal wall for exposure and extirpation of the cholesteatoma, followed by reestablishment of the canal wall during reconstruction in a single stage. This leaves the mucosa relatively undisturbed and limits the extent of canal wall removal, facilitating mastoid aeration and preservation of anatomy. Recurrent disease occurred in 5% of cases. The hearing improvement was statistically significant (p < .05), with an average preoperative 4-frequency pure tone average air-bone gap of 27.2 dB improving to 11.5 dB. No patient had a worsening of hearing. The surgery takes less time than traditional techniques, is reproducible and easily taught, and can be universally applied to all cholesteatoma patients as primary treatment.

T1  - Ossiculoplasty in canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the initial and longer term success of closing the air-bone gap (ABG) to 20 dB in ossiculoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy.METHODS: This study was conducted at a private otologic practice. Patients included those who underwent ossiculoplasty from 1989 to 1996 with canal wall down mastoidectomy, whether primary or revision (33 from a total of 387 tympanomastoidectomies). Outcome measures included ABG closure, long-term hearing stability, mastoid appearance, extrusion, and sensorineural hearing loss.RESULTS: Almost 64% of ABGs were closed to within 20 dB. The mean pure-tone average improvement was 12.3 dB. The mean PTA hearing decline in the years after surgery was slightly less than 1 dB/year.CONCLUSION: Hearing improvement with a stable long-term hearing result is possible with canal wall down mastoidectomy. The potential for hearing gain is greatest for patients having larger preoperative ABGs.

T1  - Surgical treatment of labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma
AB  - In a 144-month period, 27 cases of labyrinthine fistula (LF) were seen, and 360 mastoid operations were performed; the LF prevalence was 7.5%. Primary symptoms were hypoacusis, otorrhea, vertigo, tinnitus, and otalgia. All patients underwent preoperative CT scans and preoperative audiometry. LF diagnosis was made before surgery for 93% of patients on the basis of symptoms, signs, and imaging studies. With respect to surgical technique, the canal-wall-down procedure was performed in 92%, and the canal-wall-up procedure was performed in 8%. In 88% of patients the fistula was located in the horizontal semicircular canal. In 96% of patients the cholesteatoma matrix was removed, and the fistula was sealed; in 4% of patients the matrix was left. With a follow-up of 13 years, vertigo disappeared in 96% of patients, and hearing remained unchanged in 70% of patients. Further complications of chronic otitis media existed in approximately half of the patients with LF. Open surgery with removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and sealing of the fistula with temporalis fascia in a canal-wall-down manner is a safe procedure that can make vertigo disappear and helps to preserve cochlear function.

T1  - Soft-wall reconstruction for cholesteatoma surgery: reappraisal
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the validity of the soft-wall reconstruction method of the posterior meatal wall in surgeries for cholesteatomas.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.PATIENTS: Subjects consisted of 52 patients (54 ears) with fresh cholesteatoma (excluding residual or recurrent cholesteatomas) who were operated by the soft-wall reconstruction method in our clinic and observed for more than 2 years after surgery, and 29 patients (29 ears) who were operated by canal-wall-down and open method.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative period required for complete epithelization (dry ear), hearing, and incidence of the residual and recurrent cholesteatomas were compared with those operated by canal-wall-down and open method. The postoperative conditions of the soft posterior meatal wall was also investigated.RESULTS: Postoperative period to be a dry ear was significantly shorter in the soft-wall reconstruction group than in the canal-wall-down and open group (Student's t-test, t = 2.99, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the postoperative hearing or incidence of residual and recurrent cholesteatomas between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the soft-wall reconstruction method seems more versatile than the canal-wall-down and open method for cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed patients surgically treated for cholesteatoma to determine the impact of surgical procedures on preoperative hearing status and whether there was preservation, improvement, or deterioration. We reviewed 173 patients treated over a 15-year period. One hundred eighteen (68%) patients had acquired cholesteatoma and 55 (32%) patients had congenital cholesteatoma. One hundred (58%) patients had extensive disease on presentation that required canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Patients with attic cholesteatoma underwent canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and those with cholesteatoma localized to the middle-ear space were adequately treated with tympanotomy. Hearing was preserved in 101 cases (59%), improved in 30 (17%), became worse in 23 (13%), and could not be accurately assessed in 19 (11%) due to lack of documentation. A second surgical procedure for recidivistic (recurrent or residual) disease was required in 53 (30%). Ipsilateral facial paralysis was noted in 3 (1.7%) patients immediately after recovery from anaesthesia, and 1 (0.5%) patient had a sensorineural hearing loss. This study confirmed the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma in children and demonstrated the need for careful preoperative evaluation, meticulous surgical technique, and prudent postoperative follow-up.

T1  - Determination of the levels of expression of sarcolectin and calcyclin and of the percentages of apoptotic but not proliferating cells to enable distinction between recurrent and nonrecurrent cholesteatomas
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate in a series of cholesteatomas 1. whether subgroups of cholesteatomas with specific proliferative/apoptotic features exhibit distinct differentiation markers and 2. whether these different subgroups identified at the biological level relate to specific groups of clinically identified cholesteatomas.STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of 55 cholesteatomas resected by the same surgeon, by means of canal wall up and canal wall down surgical procedures.METHODS: Two differentiation markers were used: biotinylated sarcolectin (to identify sarcolectin-binding sites) and a monoclonal antibody directed against calcyclin (which is the S100A6 protein). The growth pattern in cholesteatomas was characterized at three distinct levels: 1. the cell proliferation level determined by means of the MIB-1 antibody, which enables the Ki-67 cell-cycle-related antigen to be identified on archival material; 2. the apoptosis level determined by means of the in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining); and 3. the p53 tumor suppressor gene-related product determined by means of p53 immunohistochemistry.RESULTS: The cholesteatomas that exhibited the highest proportion of apoptotic cells were those which exhibited the highest level of sarcolectin-binding sites (i.e., sialic acids). In contrast, the cholesteatomas exhibiting the lowest level of both proliferation and apoptosis showed the highest level of calcyclin. Recurrent cholesteatomas can be identified from nonrecurrent ones on the basis of three features, namely, the level of apoptotic cells, the way in which the apoptotic cells are distributed (i.e., homogeneously vs. heterogeneously), and the percentage of calcyclin-positive cells.CONCLUSIONS: The present data emphasize the existence of distinct subgroups of cholesteatomas identifiable at both cell kinetic and differentiation levels. Some of the biological variables used here to identify distinct biological subgroups of cholesteatomas in turn enabled some biological variables to be identified, so making it possible to classify the cholesteatomas in terms of recurrence versus nonrecurrence.

T1  - Relevant issues in revision canal-wall-down mastoidectomy
AB  - The role of canal-wall-down (CWD) versus intact-canal-wall (ICW) mastoidectomy in the treatment of chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma remains a debated issue. Although past conventional wisdom has held that CWD mastoid surgery leads to a "safe" ear and is technically less demanding than the more controversial ICW mastoidectomy, this is often not the case. Although our preference is an ICW technique when possible, 47 of 109 (43%) mastoid procedures for chronic otitis media performed between January 1993 and June 1996 involved a CWD mastoid cavity. More than two thirds of these procedures (32 of 47) represented revision surgery, the most common indication being a poorly contoured, preexisting CWD mastoidectomy with persistent otorrhea. A dry, well-epithelialized ear was obtained in 90% of cases. Our preferred method of ossicular reconstruction (double cartilage block ossiculoplasty) is detailed, and hearing results according to American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery guidelines are reported.

T1  - Chronic inflammatory ear disease and cholesteatoma: creation of auxiliary attic aeration pathways by microdissection
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The attic compartments, except for Prussak's space, are aerated through the tympanic isthmus. The aim of this study was to develop aeration pathways that would bypass the isthmus in surgery for chronic inflammatory ear disease and cholesteatoma.BACKGROUND: Microdissection of the epitympanum has shown that the anterior attic and the supratubal recess are separated by the tensor fold, the excision of which creates a large new aeration pathway.METHODS: Earlier surgical experience was reexamined as to the access to the tensor fold. Twenty temporal bones were dissected to create clinically useful new surgical routes for tensor fold removal in the presence of an intact ossicular chain.RESULTS: An endaural atticotomy, extended to the supratubal recess, allows excision of the tensor fold; however, the excision must be performed blindly. Cutting the neck of the malleus to allow lateral lifting of the manubrium exposes the tensor tendon and allows rapid excision of the fold. The elasticity of the tendon assists in approximation of the cut edges. In canal wall up surgery, removal of the lateral attic bone until the root of the zygoma exposes the anterior surface of the head of the malleus and the lateral portion of the transverse crest. Drill-out of the crest leads directly to the posterior side of the tensor fold, allowing its excision under direct vision. Thinning of the attic bone lateral to the body and short process of the incus allows simultaneous removal of the lateral incudomalleal fold.CONCLUSIONS: When the ossicular chain is discontinuous, tensor fold resection can be made under direct vision. With an intact chain, cutting of the neck of the malleus used in tympanic glomus tumors causes no hearing changes, allows complete fold excision, and is adaptable to chronic ear surgery. The frontolateral attic route for removal of tensor fold, together with the lateral incudomalleal fold, can be used in the canal wall up surgery to improve attic aeration. [References: 13]

T1  - Canal-down tympanoplasty; one-stage tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, for non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media associated with osteitis
AB  - We operated on 54 ears using the canal-down procedure consisting of one-stage tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration for non-cholesteatoma otitis media with lesions in the ossicular chain and compared the results with those of patients treated with the canal-up procedure. Complications, such as mastoid problems, which have been observed in surgery with the simple canal-down procedure, were not observed in operations combining mastoid obliteration. The success rate for our procedure as evaluated by postoperative hearing levels, according to the standards established by the Japan Society of Clinical Otology, Committee on Nomenclature 1987, was 77.4% with tympanoplasty (ceramic P type) with reconstruction of the ossicular chain; 70.6% with reconstructive surgery using T type ceramic; and 50.0% with reconstructive surgery using the patient's own bone. Overall, the success rate was 72.2%. Our procedure seems to be superior to the canal-up procedure with respect to improvement of hearing levels in the treatment of patients with chronic otitis media associated with lesions in the ossicular chain.

T1  - [Intact ossicular chain cholesteatoma: aspects and results of conservative surgery]
AB  - We present a 24 case-study of intact ossicular chain cholesteatomas among 158 first-look procedures performed between august 93 and april 96 (15%). The eradication of the disease was achieved via canal wall up technique without disrupting the ossicular chain in 20 cases (84%). Technical procedures are described. This new surgical attitude has enabled us to achieve better functional results. Second look procedures have not been necessary in all cases and occurrence of residuals has not been increased on a 14 months follow up period (2 cases out of 24 patients: 8%). Therefore, a longer follow up period is necessary to validate the results obtained using this recent concept.

T1  - [Middle ear cholesteatoma in children. Criteria for surgical procedure in 57 cases]
AB  - Fifty five children with 57 cholesteatomas (2 bilateral cholesteatomas) were operated on by the same surgeon. The median period of follow-up was 87 months. Fifteen cases were lost to follow-up (26%). An ossicular erosion was present in 76% of cases. In the first stage, an "intact canal wall technique" (ICWT) was carried out in 44% and a "canal wall down technique" (CWDT) in 56%. A planned second stage was carried out in 76% of ICWT and 56% of CWDT. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was 29% and the incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma was 11%. A third stage was carried out in 6 cases (11%) without residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Finally a CWDT was performed in 65% and a ICWT in 35%. The hearing results were significantly better with ICWT but this was due to a better preoperative hearing level. Whatever the surgical technique, the hearing results were better in the presence of an intact stapes. The surgery was individualized. Although ICWT is our priority technique, it was feasible, in our experience, only in a minority of cases because of difficult ablation, insufficient eustachian tube function and very advanced sigmoid sinus or very low lying tegmen plate. Minimal postoperative cavity problems were encountered, even in children where in our experience the mastoidal pneumatisation is limited.

T1  - Hearing results in pediatric patients after canal-wall-up and canal-wall-down mastoid surgery
AB  - Hearing results were studied in pediatric patients after canal-wall-up and canal-wall-down mastoid surgery in a private practice setting. A retrospective chart review was performed on 69 patients who underwent surgery from 1991-1995. Twenty-six patients underwent canal-wall-up mastoidectomies, and 43 patients underwent canal-wall-down mastoidectomies. Various types of ossicular reconstruction were performed in patients in both groups. Hearing was evaluated for preoperative and postoperative pure-tone averages, speech-reception thresholds, and air-bone gaps for the various types of ossicular reconstruction. Patients with canal-wall-up mastoidectomies and an intact ossicular chain had an average postoperative air-bone gap of 15 dB, whereas reconstruction of the ossicular chain (regardless of technique) resulted in an average postoperative air-bone gap of 19 dB. Patients with canal-wall-down mastoidectomies and an intact ossicular chain had an average air-bone gap of 15 dB, while all techniques of ossicular reconstruction had an average air-bone gap of 29 dB. Canal-wall-up and canal-wall-down mastoid surgeries in pediatric patients have similar hearing results. Variables other than hearing should be used to make treatment decisions regarding the canal wall in pediatric candidates for mastoid surgery.

T1  - Mastoidectomy elimination: obliterate, reconstruct, or ablate?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate a chronology of techniques used to manage troublesome open mastoid cavities, with emphasis on the selection of the mastoidectomy elimination technique most appropriate to the case at hand.STUDY DESIGN: The study design was a retrospective review of techniques used in 465 consecutive elimination cases.SETTING: The study was conducted at a single surgeon's private otologic practice.PATIENTS: Patients with mastoidectomy elimination who were treated from 1974-1996, including 55 patients with obliterations (cavity fill-in), 372 patients with reconstructions (canal wall repair), and 38 patients with ablations (external canal closure), requiring 823 procedures, were examined.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical success and complication rates of the techniques studied were measured.RESULTS: Optimal outcomes (89% successful) were recorded from hydroxylapatite reconstruction cases managed with canal revascularization (middle temporal flap) and cholesteatoma prevention (staging and composite grafts).CONCLUSIONS: Obliteration is recommended only over noncholesteatomatous sites because of the risk of residual disease and the difficulty re-exploring these cases. Ablation is effective in selected, severely damaged cases. All ablation cases remained disease-free after surgery. Reconstruction is the preferred method when hearing restoration is required. Canal wall reconstruction required modifications to avoid complications from poor tissue vitality and cholesteatoma. These are outlined and discussed below.

T1  - [Trans-canal mastoidectomy]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The controversy regarding the best procedure for treating middle ear cholesteatoma has lasted over 100 years. This paper discusses our current methods for dealing with cholesteatoma, always through external ear or transmeatal mastoidectomy. We present the results of three years of follow-up.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was made of 215 ears operated for cholesteatoma using a transcanal approach with one of three techniques: "on demand" DAA mastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy, and radical mastoidectomy with obliteration. Three parameters were used to evaluate results: stability of the mastoid cavity, integrity of the neotympanum, and evolution of hearing.RESULTS: The rate of cholesteatoma recurrence in ears operated with these techniques was much lower than that found in canal-wall-up techniques. Only 3 of the 215 cases (1.4%) remained unstable due to different causes three years after surgery.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high rate of cholesteatoma recurrence, canal-wall-up mastoidectomy has been abandoned in our clinic. Open techniques using a transmeatal approach, with or without obliteration, and the so-called "on demand" mastoidectomy, have yielded more stable results, although postoperative care is more critical.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media: a learning experience. Report on 389 cases with a long-term follow-up
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, during a long-term follow-up period, the results of revision surgery for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Intact canal wall and canal wall down procedures were performed. The surgical history of every patient was assessed before the operation. A dry, relatively safe, and disease-free ear was created in 90% of the reoperated ears (N = 389). The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 5% for the total group. Reperforations of the tympanic membrane occurred in 10%, and persistent or recurrent otorrhea was present in 10% of cases. The functional hearing results were quite satisfactory. A residual air-bone gap of < or =30 dB was reached in 70.3% of the cases after revision tympanoplasty only (N = 41). Revision mastoidectomy with revision tympanoplasty as a one-stage procedure led subsequently, in 76% of intact canal wall procedures (N = 113) and 55% of canal wall down procedures (N = 98), to a residual air-bone gap of < or =30 dB.

T1  - [Fixation of the temporarily removed posterior wall of the auditory canal with plate osteosynthesis: a new technique]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporary removal of the posterior external ear canal wall allows excellent exposure of the middle ear and epitympanum without the negative sequelae of a cavity as can occur after canal-wall down procedures. Safe fixation of the bony canal wall, however, has not always been possible with a risk for prolonged healing and bone necrosis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A new technique permits rigid internal fixation of the posterior canal wall. A titanium miniplate of 10 holes length commonly used for orbital rim surgery is adapted to the cortical surface of the mastoid just posterior to the external ear canal. Six holes for 1.3 mm screws are drilled into the cortical bone: two screws behind the ear canal, two screws on the temporal line, and two on the mastoid tip. All fixation material is then removed and a mastoidectomy is carried out with preservation of the cortical bone for the screws. The external ear canal skin, which has been incised previously near the fibrous annulus with lateral extensions, is mobilized laterally using a newly designed retroflected microraspatory. This creates a vital skin flap that might be essential to avoid bone necrosis. No other skin incisions are needed in the canal. The posterior bony canal wall is cut using an oscillating saw Osseoscalpel, secured by facial nerve monitoring. After middle ear surgery and tympanoplasty have been completed, the canal wall is repositioned and fastened precisely in its place with rigid internal fixation allowing a secure stabilization.RESULTS: This new technique has proven to be safe and reliable on the first five patients. There has been no bone necrosis within an observation period of 18 months.CONCLUSIONS: Rigid internal fixation is an alternative technique to safely readapt the posterior auditory canal wall.

T1  - Prognostic factors in tympanoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of pathologic and technical variables influencing the functional outcome of tympanoplasty.PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the records of 544 patients affected by chronic otitis with or without cholesteatoma, operated on by the senior author in a city hospital ENT department. Follow-up was provided systematically by the same institution.INTERVENTIONS: These included tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy in 339 cases, canal wall up technique in 134 cases, and canal wall down in 71 cases. Three hundred twenty-six (60%) were primary, and 218 (40%) were revision procedures. Myringoplasty was performed with autologous temporalis fascia, ossiculoplasty with incus interposition, or partial or total ossicular prostheses. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 12-50 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing results were defined according to the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium Guidelines. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine group differences. Multiple logistic regression analysis was subsequently carried out on the different pathology groups via the hierarchical log linear model. A probability value of p < 0.05 was the level of significance.RESULTS: The status of the mucosal lining, the mastoidectomy, the availability of the malleus handle, and the tympanic membrane perforation were all significantly predictive of the hearing outcome but with differing weight according to the pathologic condition.CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic and technical factors diversely affect the functional outcome of tympanoplasty. A better knowledge of their predictive roles and weights may be useful in both the surgeon's judgment and in the information given to the patient.

T1  - [Mastoid obliteration in open cavities]
AB  - The obliteration of a large or irregular mastoidectomy cavities with hard-to-control areas is a common problem for ENT surgeons. Numerous obliteration techniques have been proposed in the last 50 years. We report our experience of obliteration of mastoid cavities in 74 ears using autogenous mastoid cortical bone chips and rib cartilage. Our procedure, a partial obliteration with meatoplasty, has yielded good results. Almost 92% of these ears were dry three years after surgery. There were no cases of recurrent cholesteatoma between bone chips.

T1  - [Preliminary functional results of tympanoplasty with palisade cartilage]
AB  - Total or subtotal reconstruction of the tympanic membrane with cartilage palisades counteracts the tendency to retraction observed in ears with functional problems of the tube or altered gas exchange of the mucosa, in contrast with "soft" autologous materials such as temporal fascia or perichondrium. Because of its low turnover, cartilage is more resistant to the prolonged absence of neovascularization from the periphery in (sub) total perforation making it more resistant to infection. However, the use of palisade cartilage has been questioned for the functional recuperation of the middle ear because of its rigidity and thickness. A retrospective study was made of the functional results of 148 type III tympanoplasties with partial or complete reconstruction with cartilage after a one-stage procedure. A comparison of 108 ears with a mean postoperative follow-up of 20 months and 40 ears with a mean follow-up of more than 6 months showed no statistically significant difference in the overall functional results. A "social" hearing level (GAP < 30 dB) was achieved in 83.2%: the gain was 1-30 dB in 75.6% of cases (n = 112). No statistically significant differences were found between the functional results of primary surgery and re-operation. Statistically significant differences were found in the functional results of canal wall down and canal wall up procedures.

T1  - [Considerations regarding functional cholesteatoma surgery. II. Open techniques]
AB  - A review was made of 128 canal wall-down tympanoplasties for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The cholesteatoma was found in the attic (82.4%), antrum (71.7%), mastoid (45.8%), and mesotympanum (35.8%). In 89.1% of cases there was ossicular chain injury. In 39%, the ossicular chain was partially reconstructed (modified canal wall-down tympanoplasty). After one year, 84.4% of the operated ears were safe, dry and self-cleaning. The others (15.6%) had postoperative otorrhea. Canal wall-down modified mastoidectomy achieved closure of the air-bone gap from 40 to 24 dB (p < 0.001).

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma: an individualized, single-stage approach
AB  - We report our experience with a one-stage surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma in 216 ears. Our technique is based on three main principles: (1) the surgery is individualized; (2) the goal of surgery is to completely remove cholesteatoma and related disease in one operation; and (3) the reconstruction is performed to provide both good hearing and a dry, trouble-free ear. The incidence of recidivism was 10.2%, and the rate achieved was 13.3% at 5 years and 24% at 10 years. Canal wall down surgery was the predominant procedure used. The incidence of intraoperative neurosensory hearing loss, vertigo, and facial nerve injury was extremely low. The postoperative cavity problems encountered were minimal.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery with the canal-wall-down technique
AB  - This is a retrospective study of a limited group of 30 patients, children and adults, diagnosed as having cholesteatomas. Analysis includes audiological data and surgical results. Two techniques were used in surgery. In half of the cases, an obliteration technique was used, and in the remainder an open radical cavity was created. The method used was determined by the surgeon and in some measure by the extent of the disease. Our conclusions are that the obliteration technique offers better hearing results than the open-cavity technique. The number of residuals over a 4- to 5-year period was acceptable and cavity problems were avoided.

T1  - Hearing results following modified radical versus canal-up mastoidectomy
AB  - Modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) provides relatively safe surgical access for the removal of chronic middle ear and mastoid disease and gives reproducible results. However, it had been suggested that hearing may not be as good as that after "intact canal wall mastoidectomy" (ICWM). This paper reviews 153 tertiary referrals suffering from extensive disease who underwent MRM and compares their hearing results with those obtained by other authors using ICWM and MRM and a variety of reconstructive techniques. In this study there were no dead ears and no significant changes in bone conduction despite prolonged drilling and extensive disease. Hearing results after MRM were found to be better after primary surgery than after revision and better in the presence of an intact stapes. No rigid prostheses were used at first-stage surgery. There were no significant differences found between hearing results obtained by MRM in this series and other published results of canal wall down mastoidectomy and ICWM, irrespective of the use of ossicular replacement prostheses.

T1  - Evaluation of mastoid obliteration surgery
AB  - The anatomic results of mastoid obliteration surgery on 54 ears during the past 10 years were analyzed, and the comparative utility of several materials for obliteration was evaluated. Thirty-three ears had primary chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma (group 1), and 21 ears had old open mastoid with intractable chronic discharge due to incomplete epithelialization (group 2). The materials used for obliteration were biologic (pedicled muscle flap, autogenous bone chips, tragal cartilage with perichondrium, allograft dura), nonbiologic (hydroxyapatite), or a combination of two of these materials. Evaluation at 2 months postoperatively showed that 42 ears were anatomically complete, whereas the other 12 ears were incomplete: three cases in group 1 and nine cases in group 2. The main causes of these unsatisfactory results were exposure of transplanted artificial material or partial loss of the pedicled muscle flap. In the long-term follow-up results, four ears were evaluated as unsatisfactory in group 1, and six ears in group 2, owing to shrinkage of obliterated tissue. The major causes of failure were anatomic incompleteness following surgery for old open mastoid cavity, in which the use of biologic materials for obliteration was much safer than nonbiologic material, and from the protrusion of artificial materials used.

T1  - Hearing results of surgery for acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Hearing results in 349 chronic ears with cholesteatoma were evaluated. The great majority of the patients underwent canal wall-down mastoidectomy as a one-stage procedure. After a mean follow-up period of 7.3 years, 35% of the ears operated on showed hearing levels of 30 dB or better. Hearing improved in 30%, remained unchanged in 55%, and worsened in 15%. The mean hearing gain was only 5 dB. In 23% of ears with otherwise successful outcomes the tympanum turned fibrotic, leading to poor hearing function.

AB  - The cholesteatoma should be removed with a canal wall down-technique in small mastoids. In patients with well or highly pneumatized temporal bones the reconstruction of the posterior canal wall is recommended after complete removal of the matrix. Myringoplasty is mainly performed using perichondrium. In highly damaged middle ears the cartilage palisade technique is indicated.

T1  - Modified canal wall-up mastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration for severe chronic otitis media
AB  - Mastoid tympanoplasty with a canal wall-up technique provides better conditions for a healthy skin lining than canal wall-down techniques. The formation of retraction pockets in residual pneumatized cavities is however a major cause of cholesteatoma recurrence with canal wall-up techniques. We have therefore attempted to combine the advantages of both canal wall-down and canal wall-up techniques. The posterior wall is kept up, the mastoid is obliterated with adipose tissue, the attic is exteriorized in the ear canal and hearing is restored with a minimal-size hypotympanic cavity only. Preliminary results from 41 cases with a follow-up of 6 months to 6 years suggest that skin conditions in the enlarged ear canal are adequate and that cholesteatoma do not recur.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Cholesteatoma in children is a particularly difficult disorder because of the special developmental issues unique to the age group and the long-term follow-up implications of surgical changes to the ear. The two basic controversies are canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down surgery, and staged versus single-stage surgery. No single philosophy is applicable to all children with cholesteatoma. Instead, the surgeon should individualize the management of pediatric cholesteatoma by considering the location and extent of the cholesteatoma, the overall status of infections and hearing, socioeconomic issues of access to follow-up and future surgery, and the likelihood of compliance with the full management plan.

T1  - Cholesteatomas in Greenlandic Inuit. A retrospective study and follow-up of treated cases from 1976-91
AB  - Chronic otitis media is frequent among the Inuit in Greenland, but reports of cholesteatomas are rare. To describe cholesteatoma in Greenland, we have performed a retrospective study and follow-up of Greenlandic Inuit treated at the ENT-department, Rigshospitalet, Denmark in the period 1976-91. We found 35 Greenlandic Inuit with cholesteatoma, the first in 1976. Median age was 19 years. The total incidence was calculated to 5 per 100.000 per year, or 2 new cases per year. The geographical distribution showed less cholesteatomas among the people with a traditional way of life in the Hunter region. The complication rate was 11%. The extension and pathology of the cholesteatomas indicated late and infrequent contact with an ENT specialist. The follow-up study revealed 53% dry ears with intact tympanic membrane, and 47% with intermittent ear discharge. Residual or recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 46% of the patients, less frequently when the primary operation included mastoidectomy with canal wall-down technique. We recommend this operation in most Greenlandic Inuit with cholesteatomas.

T1  - [The mastoid surgery in children at the Doce de Octubre Hospital. Review of the years 1988-1991]
AB  - A study was made of 21 children with cholesteatoma and chronic otitis media between 1989 and 1991. We reviewed diagnostic tools, presurgical data, surgical procedures and results. Certain aspects of special relevance such as congenital anomalies and presurgical complications, are emphasized. The procedure of choice was mastoid tympanoplasty with the canal wall down, which is preferred in children. Hearing results were poor, partially caused by the process of bone resorption and by the surgical technique used. The incidence of persistent disease and recurrent cholesteatoma was high but we achieved a good control of the disease development because the canal wall down procedure allowed visualization and cleaning of the mastoid cavity.

T1  - [Fixed retraction pockets and cholesteatoma in children. Authors' experience with 199 cases]
AB  - Cholesteatoma is more destructive in the child than in the adult, but few studies have examined the outcome as a function of age. The authors evaluated retrospectively their experience in 199 cases of cholesteatomas or uncontrollable fixed retraction pouches in children under the age of 15. Mean follow-up was 2 and a half years and the anatomic and functional results are detailed. Reasons for performing first intention or second intention canal wall up or down procedures were analyzed as a function of age. Residual cholesteatomas were particularly frequent in whatever the initial surgical procedure. Cholesteatomas and retraction pouches in the child under 5 (n = 24) were particularly aggressive and destructive, often requiring a canal wall down operation. Residual cholesteatomas were also very frequent and involved both bony and functional element of the petrus. The clinical course of cholesteatoma in the young child appears to be very different, becoming less destructive as the child reaches adulthood.

T1  - [Cholesteatoma in children. Apropos of 104 cases]
AB  - Between 1988 and 1993, 94 children from 3 to 15 years of age underwent one or more surgical procedures for cholesteatoma or epithelization of the middle ear space. Ten children had bilateral disease. 94 ears were operated for the first time and 10 ears had had previous surgery at other institutions. A total of 204 procedures were performed: 190 for cholesteatoma and 14 for epithelization of the middle ear space. Preoperative audiometry showed a mean air-bone gap of 30 decibels. 69% of the ears had ossicular osteolysis. The surgical technique was decided at the time of surgery. This was most often a canal-wall-up procedure which was almost routinely followed by surgical revision (92%). Pearl-like masses or recurrent cholesteatoma were frequently found at the second or third operation (73%) but most could ultimately be controlled with a canal-wall-up procedure. A canal-wall-up down procedure was necessary in 20% of the ears at either the second or third operation because of important residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Post-operative audiometry showed a mean air-bone gap of 30 decibels.

T1  - Prevention of recurrence of cholesteatoma in intact canal wall tympanoplasty
AB  - In the treatment of cholesteatoma employing intact canal wall tympanoplasty, staging the operation and re-establishment of aeration of the tympanic cavity are required to eradicate possible causes of recurrence, cholesteatoma residue, and retraction pocket. The planned staged tympanoplasty with preventive measures for recurrence has evolved. At the second-stage operation, one of the following three types of operations was performed according to the grade of aeration and healing of tympanic cavity: type S1, only ossiculoplasty; type S2, ossiculoplasty and scutumplasty; and type S3, ossiculoplasty, scutumplasty, and mastoid obliteration. The surgical concept, indication, and technique are described in detail. The recurrence rate in the 134 patients without previous surgery, 95 adults and 39 children, operated on between 1987 and 1991 was 2.2 percent (7.6% in the children and 0% in the adult). Although the rate of the recidivism was significantly reduced, deep retraction pocket developed in 15 percent of adults and in 23 percent of children. The incidence of deep retraction pocket formation was lowest in the adults with type S1 operation and highest in the children with type S3 operation.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy: canal wall up procedures
AB  - Management of the mastoid in cases of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma remains controversial. Whether to leave the canal wall up or perform a cavity technique continues to be debated. The author reviewed his personal cases of surgery for chronic otitis media over a 5-year period and studied 108 cases without prior surgery who required tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma. Thirty-two percent of the cases were in children 15 years of age and under. Over two thirds of the procedures were canal wall up, and the remainder of patients underwent a canal wall down technique with obliteration. There was little difference in the results between children and adults, with the exception of there being a tendency for a greater degree of ossicular destruction in the children and a greater incidence of residual disease at second stage surgery. There was a 3 percent incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma. It appears that the intact canal wall technique is preferable in both children and adults, when circumstances are favorable.

T1  - Long-term results of surgical treatment in different cholesteatoma types
AB  - Results of surgical treatment in different types of cholesteatoma were analyzed in 431 chronic ears. Mean follow-up period was 6.9 years. The total recurrence rate (including both residual and recurrent cholesteatoma) was 8.6 percent. The recurrence rate was lowest (7.4%) in attic cholesteatoma and highest (10.0%) in pars tensa retraction cholesteatoma. The great majority (98%) of the operations were one-stage procedures. Canal wall down mastoidectomy was the procedure in 297 cases, with a recurrence rate of 7.7 percent; canal wall up mastoidectomy, in 86 cases, yielded a recurrence rate of 9.3 percent, and in 48 ears the cholesteatoma was removed by a transcanal procedure without mastoidectomy, giving a recurrence rate of 12.5 percent. Hearing results in attic and sinus cholesteatoma were significantly better than in pars tensa retraction cholesteatoma. Of the whole series, hearing improved in 36 percent and deteriorated in 28 percent. It is concluded that surgery should be individualized according to site and size of the cholesteatoma, but all large cholesteatomas require canal wall down procedure to avoid recurrence.

T1  - Surgery for recurrent and residual cholesteatoma
AB  - One hundred twelve patients (116 ears) were treated for recurrent and residual cholesteatoma. A retrospective review revealed that 66% had undergone canal wall down mastoidectomy at the previous surgery. The surgical procedure at revision was selected on the basis of an intraoperative assessment of the extent of disease, and clinical prediction of eustachian tube function. The average period of follow-up was 3.4 years. Revision surgery was successful in providing the patient with a safe, dry ear in 105 (91%) of 116 cases. Surgical principles and hearing results are presented.

T1  - Single-stage management of cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical management of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma can be performed in a single-stage procedure, with revision surgery necessary because of recurrent disease or electively with unsatisfactory hearing results. We retrospectively reviewed 164 cases with cholesteatoma surgically managed from 1980 through 1986. In total there were 11 tympanoplasties, 36 canal wall-up mastoidectomies, 81 canal wall down modified radical mastoidectomies, and 36 radical mastoidectomies. The recidivistic rate for cholesteatoma in patients available for 5-year followup was 11% for tympanoplasties, 19% for canal wall-up mastoidectomies, 5% for canal wall-down modified radical mastoidectomies, and 0% for radical mastoidectomies. Hearing results were best in patients who required tympanoplasty alone, followed by those who underwent canal wall-down procedures. Single-stage management of cholesteatoma with modified radical mastoidectomy (canal wall-down) required fewer revisions for recidivistic cholesteatoma and achieved better hearing results than canal wall-up procedures. We conclude, therefore, that staging is not necessary. Improved hearing may likely be achieved with a second procedure, but this is at the patient's discretion.

T1  - Autograft tragal and conchal palisade cartilage and perichondrium in tympanomastoid reconstruction
AB  - Since Utech's introduction of cartilage as a columella in ear surgery in 1969, we have used tragal and conchal autografts for reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and the auditory canal wall in 13,000 cases. As large pieces of cartilage can twist in later years, we place palisaded cartilage fragments with perichondrium parallel to the manubrium of the malleus in type I tympanoplasties and in type II or III procedures parallel to the long process of the incus. The "annulus-stapes plate" in type III tympanoplasties replaces the function of the incus (and malleus), crossing the promontory and reducing adhesions. A "tunnelplasty" keeps the eustachian tube entrance open with the semiring of cartilage ("simmering") apposed to the inside of the annulus, reconstructing the tympanomeatal niche. The "architrave" created rests on the tensor tympani while the palisaded epitympanum and antrum plasty allows ventilation of the antrum. Mastoid obliteration is performed with an autogenous perichondrial transplant to which the palisaded incised cartilage portions adhere, adapting to the underlying structure.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - This is a retrospective review of 71 patients charts, over a 10-year period, with the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. An analysis included the demographic data, audiological data and surgical results. The selection of the surgical technique depended on the extent of the disease. In the majority of cases the primary procedure was of the canal wall down technique, which is contrary to most recently published reports. Most of the cholesteatomas were extensive, thereby requiring a more aggressive surgical approach. It was our opinion that the extent of the disease in a child was greater than in an adult. Another feature found in children is the occurrence of the disease behind an intact tympanic membrane. In this review, 35% of the cases presented in this manner. Hearing was maintained or improved in the majority of cases. It is concluded that cholesteatoma in children may differ from that in the adult and that even with canal wall down procedures, maintenance or improvement of hearing is achieved in most patients.

T1  - Management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma
AB  - The surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. Forty cases (41 ears) of labyrinthine fistulas were reviewed. This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula. Operative management is described.

T1  - Reconstruction of radical mastoidectomy by obliteration technique
AB  - Reconstruction of radical mastoidectomy was performed by obliteration tympanoplasty using Palva flap in 199 ears either in one stage (normal mucosa, normal stapes, no risk of residual cholesteatoma behind the flap) or in two stages. At the 2nd stage, middle ear was reopened and the posterior cavity was checked in 34 cases. Bony pate or ceramic granules may be added behind the flap, especially at this second stage. The closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 97% of cases. Residual cholesteatoma was removed in the middle ear at the 2nd stage in 17% of the ears. Late residual cholesteatoma behind the flap appeared in 5 cases where the posterior cavity had not been checked. Three early retraction pockets were due to technical failures which were more recently corrected by the use of fibromuscular graft placed between the fascia graft an the Palva flap. Three late retraction pockets progressed under the tympanic membrane from above to below. Hearing results were better in the 1st stage procedures, obviously selected: ABG within 20 dB in 83% of the ears with a normal stapes. On the contrary, in 2 stage procedures, ABG within 20 dB was achieved only in 50% of cases with a normal stapes and 29% of the ears where the crura were missing.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: a comparison of three techniques
AB  - The debate regarding the surgical technique for the management of cholesteatoma still continues. The resolution of this issue will only come with the study of the long term results of well controlled series. In this paper long term follow-up on three groups of patients is reported. The groups underwent combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT), mastoid tympanoplasty with obliteration (MOT), and modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) respectively for cholesteatoma. The factors studied included frequency of required review, condition of the external canal/cavity, and hearing status. The meatal cross-sectional areas and cavity volumes were also measured for the MRM and MOT groups. Analysis of the data showed no significant difference between the groups in either frequency of review or cavity status. The hearing results showed an initial improvement in all groups, however, over the prolonged follow-up period the air conduction threshold gradually increased. In conclusion this data supports the view that a one-stage canal wall down procedure provides maximum long term patient benefit.

T1  - A technique for the reconstruction of the posterior canal wall and mastoid obliteration in radical cavity surgery
AB  - The open technique in cholesteatoma surgery has, besides a higher security concerning the recurrence of disease, some disadvantages: lifelong care for the cavity, often discharging granulations, and vestibular vertigo due to the lack of labyrinthine protection. Most of the disadvantages can be avoided by the obliteration of the mastoid cavity, for which many different techniques have been described in literature. The authors recommend a new method: the reconstruction of the posterior canal wall using autograft conchal cartilage and the obliteration of the mastoid cavity with hydroxyapatite granulate. The technique can be used for the treatment of old cavities as well as for one-stage surgery. The results of 25 cases are reported. Due to the elevation of the tympanic membrane on a nearly physiologic level and suitable tympanoplastic procedures an air-bone gap of less than 30 dB can be reached in more than 70%.

T1  - [A new external canal wall-preserving method for aural cholesteatoma surgery--the osteocutaneous flap]
AB  - There are three major results of successful aural cholesteatoma surgery. They are called cavity opened, cavity obliterated and cavity closed (Table 1). Cavity opened or cavity closed, call for the use of canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU), respectively. With an obliterated cavity, either the canal wall down or canal wall up method may be used. An intermediate form for management of the canal wall is called temporary CWD and two methods of this form have been used. One is the temporary posterosuperior canal wall resection method and the other is the one the author describes here, the osteocutaneous flap for wall preservation. The author used this method after deciding to cut down the canal wall in the case of difficult removal of cholesteatoma in the epitympanum or the middle ear recesses under the CWU procedure. In fifteen cases in the past 2 years this method has been used to complete operations which initially began with the CWU procedure. The results included short healing time, less post-operation care, fair hearing recovery and optimal conditions for a smooth and safe 2nd operation. The osteocutaneous flap method gives us one more choice in the many different methods of cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - [Infantile cholesteatoma]
AB  - We present the results obtained in a group of 52 patients (55 ears), 15 years old or younger, diagnosed with middle ear cholesteatoma. After the evaluation of their clinical records, audiometry and X ray, surgery was performed by means of canal wall up procedures in 40 ears (72%) and canal wall down procedures in 15 (27%). The cholesteatoma was eradicated in 62% of the first group and in 86% of the second one. In 17 patients there was a recurrence. In those cases of canal wall up procedures they were transformed in canal wall down, or in the canal wall down the cavity was cleaned up. Only in 2 of these 17 recurrences, there was a second recurrence. In 7 cases a tympanoplasty was performed and the audiometric GAP was reduced in 57% and only in 19% when tympanoplasty wasn't performed. [References: 37]

T1  - Late results of surgery in different cholesteatoma types
AB  - Our series of 740 cholesteatomas, operated during the period 1969 to 1980, were seen at follow-up several times with a median observation period of 9.2 years (range 3-21 years). There were; 273 attic cholesteatomas with retraction (perforation) of Shrapnell's membrane; 271 sinus cholesteatomas with superioposterior retraction (perforation) of pars tensa, and 196 tensa retraction cholesteatomas extending from a retraction of the whole pars tensa. The late results were analyzed for each type separately, and compared. The recurrence rate was lowest (6.6%) in attic cholesteatoma and highest (13.3%) in tensa retraction cholesteatoma. In all three types no residual cholesteatomas were detected after the 4th postoperative year, whereas recurrent cholesteatomas occurred up to 10 years after surgery. The reoperation rate was lowest (15%) in attic cholesteatoma and almost the same (21%) in sinus and tensa retraction cholesteatoma. The hearing results were best in attic cholesteatoma and poorest in tensa retraction cholesteatoma. It is concluded that cholesteatoma surgery should be individualized and that both the canal wall up and canal wall down methods have their place in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - How I do it--post mastoidectomy reconstruction
AB  - Traditionally, there are two approaches for mastoidectomy, namely:canal wall up and canal wall down. Canal wall up approach avoids an open mastoid cavity post-operatively but harbours the disadvantage of a reported higher incidence of recurrence of disease. Canal wall down approach has a reciprocal advantage and disadvantage. This paper reveals a methods of post mastoidectomy reconstruction of the posterior canal wall using the posterior canal skin.

T1  - [Experimental studies of the obliteration of extensive radical ear cavities with a new kind of ceramic granulate]
AB  - Modern ear surgery aims at obliterating the extensive radical cavities that remain after removal of a cholesteatoma. A wide variety of techniques have been developed, including working with muscle fascial flaps, cartilage or bone chips; osteoplastic meato-atti++----+-coantrotomy; reconstruction of the posterior auditory duct wall by ceramic dish moulds or homologous cartilage with and without obliteration of the remaining mastoid cavity. The ceramic granulate available for obliteration of the mastoid cavity is responsible for extremely high costs. In an animal experimental study, we investigated the histocompatibility of several new ceramic substances. These new ceramic materials differ especially from the conventional granulate in their implantation behaviour and also in their long-term absorption behaviour, an advantage that enables this ceramic granulate to be used on a broad scale for obliteration of the mastoid cavity and thus the implementation of a largely physiological reconstruction.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: canal wall down procedures
AB  - We prefer the intact canal wall technique for tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy, but use a canal wall down procedure in up to 25% of cases. Creating a round cavity with a large meatus is imperative if one is to obtain a trouble-free ear. The five types of canal wall down procedures are defined, as are our indications for using them. Results in 19 only hearing ears and 19 labyrinthine fistula cases are presented, along with 64 tympanoplasty cases. [References: 9]

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric age group
AB  - The diagnosis and management of cholesteatoma in children remains controversial. In the past 15 years, the senior author (S.C.P.) has treated 320 patients with cholesteatoma. Patients 18 years and younger composed 40% (125) of the overall group and are the basis for this report. The patient data were compiled using the history, physical examination, audiograms, radiographs, patient questionnaires, surgical findings, and postoperative observations. The surgical treatment selected was determined by the extent of disease, the configuration of the mastoid, and a clinical assessment of eustachian tube function. A middle ear tympanotomy approach was used in 17% of the patients, a canal wall up procedure in 31%, and a canal wall down procedure in 52.3%. The average clinical follow-up was 3.9 years, with the range being from 3 months to 13.5 years. Hearing was maintained or slightly improved in a majority of cases. Residual disease occurred in 8% of patients, and recurrent disease in only 3%. [References: 14]

T1  - Attic cholesteatoma. Recurrence rate related to observation time
AB  - Two hundred twenty-four ears with attic cholesteatomas, subjected to one-stage surgery between 1965 and 1978, were reevaluated several times, most recently in 1980/81 at a median observation time of 8 years (range, 3 to 16 years) and in 1985/86 at a median observation time of 11 years (range, 3 to 21 years). The recurrence rate was related to length of observation time. Up to and including the follow-up examination in 1980, the rate of residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity was 1.3% and 0.9% in the attic. The incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in the attic or the cavity was 1.8%. The total recurrence rate was 4.0%. At follow-up in 1985/86, the total recurrence rate had increased to 6.3%, comprising residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity in 1.8% and in the attic in 0.9% and recurrent cholesteatoma in 3.6%. A total of 133 patients had a modified canal wall up mastoidectomy, whereas 91 patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration. With regard to the total results of surgery, no significant differences could be demonstrated between the two methods, and we conclude that canal wall up mastoidectomy can be performed in one stage.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: the role of staging in closed operations
AB  - It has been proposed that closed operations on cholesteatomatous ears should be performed on a two-stage basis in order to detect disease left behind at the first operation and to correct developing retraction pockets. Two groups of patients who had closed operations performed in two stages, 100 combined approach tympanoplasties and 100 mastoid obliterations with tympanoplasty, were observed for 10 years after the second stage. A much greater than expected incidence of eventual cholesteatoma recurrence suggests that even with staging, closed techniques may provide a less than reliable outcome in surgical control of the disease, and long-term observation of ears thus treated is desirable.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: open vs closed tympanoplasty
AB  - The purpose of this report is to compare closed tympanoplasty (canal wall up) and open tympanoplasty (canal wall down) performed in ears with extensive cholesteatoma operated on and followed up during the past 11 years. The study has demonstrated that there are no significant differences between open and closed tympanoplasties in terms of both postoperative subjective problems and auditory results. The only definite difference relates to recurring cholesteatoma: canal wall-up operations are complicated by recurrence of cholesteatoma in a not insignificant number of ears and require a planned two-stage procedure in all the cases. By contrast, the postoperative clinical course of open tympanoplasties has been only rarely affected by cholesteatomatous complications. It is concluded that reduction of cholesteatoma recurrence to the greatest degree possible necessitates removal of the canal wall. Open tympanoplasty is an effective alternative for closed tympanoplasty in all cases in which there is a contraindication to preserving the canal wall and in all patients whose medical or social conditions prevent scheduling an operation in more stages.

T1  - The cholesteatomatous ear one year after surgery with obliteration technique
AB  - Fifty-seven patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were treated surgically by eradicating the cholesteatoma after a canal wall-down procedure had been performed. During the same session the canal wall was rebuilt with autologous bone, the tympanic membrane repaired with fascia, and the mastoid cavity and epitympanic space obliterated with autologous cortical mastoid bone chips and a retroauricular, anteriorly based muscle flap. One year later a second look procedure was performed in all the patients (N = 57), which permitted the anatomic effects of the obliteration operation to be mapped out before ossicular reconstruction was undertaken. At three, six, and twelve months after the first operation any secretion from the ear was recorded. Recurrent cholesteatoma was not found in any single case, residual cholesteatoma in only three cases (5.3%). The tympanic membrane was intact in fifty-four cases (94.7%) and perforated in three, none of which was combined with a residual cholesteatoma. Even though twenty-four of the fifty-seven cases had a secreting ear before the eradicating operation, fifty-six (98.2%) stayed dry during the year of observation between the two operations. Therefore, with very few exceptions, a dry, cholesteatoma-free ear and an intact tympanic membrane may be expected one year postoperatively in patients with middle ear cholesteatoma surgically treated using the described obliteration technique.

T1  - [Diminution of radical surgical cavities with hydroxyapatite]
AB  - Canal wall surgery is the safest way to eradicate cholesteatoma and to prevent recurrence of the disease. On the other hand, resulting cavity problems such as a permanently discharging ear and poor functional results made the development of alternative procedures necessary. A new technique to obliterate the mastoid volume or to reduce an old cavity by means of hydroxyapatite granulate is presented. Characteristics of the material and how to manage it are demonstrated. First experiences in 30 ears are reported. Hydroxyapatite granulate enables us to establish a primarily epithelized small cavity. Since hydroxyapatite is the anorganic component of bone its biocompatibility is excellent. It is hardly resorbed, osteointegrated and induces a new formation of bone. The size of the open cavity can therefore be designed exactly during the operation and sliding and vanishing of mass as seen in soft tissue flaps (muscle and connective tissue only) can be avoided.

T1  - Open mastoid procedures: contemporary indications and surgical technique
AB  - The history of the management of chronic ear disease with and without cholesteatoma is dominated by a canal wall down philosophy. The implication is that such an open procedure insures disease control and an uncomplicated future. In point of fact, problem canal wall down procedures can be fraught with as many serious complications as their more controversial canal wall up counterpart is alleged to propagate. Such problem cavities most commonly result from poor execution of basic technique. The objective of this paper is to identify what constitutes a problem cavity and to describe the authors' techniques to avoid such difficulties. A technique has evolved which not only eradicates disease, but which is self-cleansing and of minimal impact on the patient's lifestyle. The authors' experience with canal wall down procedures is reviewed.

T1  - The exenterated mastoid: a problem of ear surgery
AB  - The exenterated mastoid behind an intact posterior ear canal wall is one of the preconditions for the development of hidden cholesteatoma recurrences. Retraction pockets can develop into the cavity owing to persisting malfunction of the eustachian tube. Matrix inadvertently left in the tympanic space or in the mastoid process can grow into or in the cavity unnoticed. The way to avoid this nesting site is permanent obliteration of the mastoid process immediately after the eradication of the disease. Furthermore, the disadvantages of old radical operation cavities can be eliminated by secondary obliteration, connected with a revision and repair of the sound pressure transfer mechanism if necessary. It is important to use a nonresorbable obliteration material. We use methacrylate (Sulfix-6) for this purpose, so far without any negative consequences in the ears.

T1  - Mastoidectomy for acquired cholesteatoma: follow-up to 20 years
AB  - The results of 423 mastoidectomies for acquired cholesteatoma were reanalyzed 6 years after the first analysis. The mastoidectomies were placed into three groups: open-cavity, 135 modified radical and 37 radical; obliterated-cavity, 60 modified radical and 20 radical in which the mastoid cavities were obliterated with pedicle muscle grafts; and intact-canal-wall, 69 complete and 102 complete with opening of the facial recess. The following observations were made. The cholesteatoma failure rate increased: for the open-cavity group, from 6% to 7%; obliterated-cavity group, 16% to 18%; intact-canal-wall group, 35% to 45%. The precholesteatoma (retraction pocket) failure rate in the open-cavity and obliterated-cavity groups did not change. In the intact-canal-wall group, recurrent cholesteatomas developed in 8 cases initially classified as precholesteatoma failures. In 9 initially classified as successful, retraction pockets developed and 7 of these went on to recurrent cholesteatomas. Consequently, despite the progressive increase in formation of retraction pockets, the overall incidence dropped from 20% to 16%. Failure due to chronic or frequent recurrent infection did not change in the open-cavity and intact-canal-wall groups. However, in the obliterated-cavity group, it increased from 4% to 5%. The overall failure rate increased: open-cavity group, 18% to 19%; obliterated-cavity group, 29% to 30%; intact-canal-wall group, 60% to 66%.

T1  - Reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with Proplast
AB  - Many ears with prior radical or modified radical mastoidectomy operations can be rehabilitated by reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with the porous biocompatible implant material Proplast. Many techniques have been advanced for reconstruction of the posterior canal wall and/or obliteration of the mastoid bowl. We prefer reconstruction of the posterior canal wall to obliteration of the mastoid bowl on the theoretical grounds that with obliteration you lose the pneumatic buffer of the mastoid air cell system and you might be burying infection and/or cholesteatoma in the depths of the mastoid. In this article we shall present our results with elimination of the open mastoid bowl by reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with Proplast. A retrospective study of 83 consecutive patients who underwent reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with Proplast during the 5-year period 1974 to 1978 was undertaken. The surgical technique consisted of rebuilding the tympanic membrane, when necessary, repairing the ossicular chain, when necessary, and reconstructing the posterior canal wall. The overall success rate for the posterior canal wall reconstructions was 46% (38 of 83). However, after modifications were made in the technique, especially in the use of thicker fascia and/or perichondria and periosteum over the Proplast, the success rate increased dramatically to 68% (19 of 28).

T1  - Surgical therapy of chronic mastoiditis with cholesteatoma
AB  - One hundred fifty-seven ears treated surgically for chronic mastoiditis with cholesteatoma are reviewed. The selection of an operative procedure ("canal wall up" or "canal wall down") was dictated by the extent of pathologic indications in relation to the size of the patient's mastoid. The incidence of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, the hearing results, and the frequency of visits required for mastoid cavity care are reported.

T1  - [Complete obliteration of the mastoid apophysis with an artificial material. A concept for the prevention of the recurrence of cholesteatoma]
AB  - Recurrences of cholesteatoma may occur, following closed operation techniques, if retraction pockets or matrix inadvertently left in the tympanic space invade the exenterated mastoid cavity. The precondition for such recurrence is the existence of the exenterated cavities, which serve as "nesting sites" for the matrix or the retraction pockets. These recurrences can be avoided by obliterating the mastoid cavity behind a reconstructed posterior ear canal wall with a non-resorbable material (plastic bone cement) and by uniting the lateral part of the attic with the outer ear canal. This will definitely prevent the exenterated spaces from the being invaded by any recurrence. The operation technique is described.

T1  - Assessment of postoperative hearing in 528 middle ear and mastoid surgery cases in Tokai University Hospital
AB  - The postoperative hearing results in cases of tympanoplasty, radical mastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty combined with modified radical mastoidectomy on 528 ears, performed in the Tokai University Hospital between 1975 and 1980 were assessed. The assessment was based on pure-tone audiograms taken 3 months to 5 years after the operation. Out of 528 cases 70.5% gained better postoperative hearing, 6% showed no change of hearing and 23.5% showed deterioration of hearing. Auditory success of those who attained social hearing, air-bone gap closure to within 20dB or gained hearing of 20 dB or more was 53.4%. The results in cholesteatoma cases were poorer than those of non-cholesteatoma cases. In 44% of the cases, ossiculoplasty was performed, and the most successful ossiculoplasty results were obtained when the malleus was repositioned to the head of the stapes. Fairly good results were achieved when an artificial prosthesis, such as a Teflon-piston, Gelfoam-wire or platinum-piston, was used. The least successful results were found when the incus was transpositioned. In the non-ossiculoplasty group, type I tympanoplasty produced 59.5% auditory success whereas 37.3% auditory success was achieved in radical mastoidectomy. Better auditory success rates were obtained when the bony bridge was preserved than when it was removed. The results were identical in cases where the mastoid cavity was obliterated or when it was kept open. A new technique, "scutumplasty", was used for reconstructing the scutum. Revision surgery was required in only 3.4% of the cases.

T1  - [Open or/and closed operation technic in case of cholesteatoma (author's transl)]
AB  - The different, but partly very high percentage of recurrence cholesteatoma and the by that necessary re-operations could lead to the conclusion to turn away from the closed operation technic. We have tried by means of 654 re-operations to find out the reasons for failures made by us and others. From this result conclusions were drawn in regard of improving diagnosis, indication and therapy. - Both operation technics shall for the future keep their right to exist, but with a different indication basis. We give the open technic - because for the advantage of its radicality against the cholesteatoma - again more change, keep in mind to use in addition the Mastoid Obliteration Method. The "second look" in case of the closed technic should be indicated exceptionally.

AB  - When treating cholesteatoma the postoperative tendency, following closed techniques, to develop retraction pockets cannot be influenced by means of a causal therapy. What can be done, however, is to prevent the retraction pocket from becoming a recurrent cholesteatoma. This can be achieved by permanently obliterating the exenterated mastoid cavity with a non resorbable plastic. The bone-cement, Palacos R, we use makes fixed contact with the walls of the operation cavity. Negative effects of such an obliteration have so far not been observed.

T1  - Postoperative cholesteatoma: are claims for the canal wall down technique justified?
AB  - To discover whether removal of the canal wall would reduce the incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma in tympanoplasty, the findings in staged, intact canal wall tympanoplasties were compared with those in staged, modified radical mastoidectomies with cavity obliteration and tympanoplasty. In all, cholesteatoma was considered totally removed at the first operation. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was not significantly different in either group. It is concluded that staging in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma is mandatory.

T1  - Evolution of Acquired Middle Ear Cholesteatoma in Patients With Ectrodactyly, Ectodermal Dysplasia, Cleft Lip/Palate (EEC) Syndrome
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review an institutional experience with the surgical and clinical management of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma in patients with ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, cleft lip/palate (EEC) syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eight patients with medical history significant for EEC syndrome who underwent surgery for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma between 1996 and 2016. INTERVENTION(S): Appropriate surgical interventions at the time of admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): History of ventilation tube insertion, status of the contralateral ear, surgical technique, cholesteatoma recidivism, presence of postoperative external auditory canal stenosis, pre and postoperative audiograms. RESULT(S): Cholesteatoma was diagnosed in all patients, 3 (37.5%) unilateral and 5 (62.5%) bilateral, totalizing 13 ears. Six ears (46.2%) underwent a canal wall up mastoidectomy but required conversion to a canal wall down technique in a second procedure due to recurrent cholesteatoma. In the remaining seven ears (53.8%) a canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed. Of all meatoplasty performed, seven (53.8%) evolved with stenosis of the external auditory canal. CONCLUSION(S): Our results suggest that most patients with EEC syndrome and middle ear cholesteatoma should be considered for a canal wall down mastoidectomy due to extensive disease and a high rate of recidivism. In addition, a high percentage of postoperative stenosis of the external auditory canal was found in this group.

T1  - Multistage treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Middle ear cholesteatoma is challenge for the otosurgeon. The creation of a dry, safe ear is the primary goal of the cholesteatoma surgical management. In many cases especially in children multistage treatment is needed and multiple operations may be required. Elimination of advanced cholesteatoma is almost always possible with CWD technique. In cases with radical mastoidectomy the posterior canal wall should be reconstructed. If it is not possible mastoid cavity obliteration in combination with tympanoplasty should be done. If it is not performed during the first operation, ossiculoplasty is an important part of a second-look surgery through endoscopic ear surgery, which is possible and have advantages in the hidden areas, like attic, supratubal recess and sinus tympani to diminish residual cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is an aggressive disease, however we follow-up each patient annualy for many years and observe additionally with DWI-MRT. Recurrence can occur long time after the initial surgical excision even in the otherwise asymptomatic patient, that wise mastoid cavity obliteration are designed for primary and revision surgery. In cases with posterior canal wall reconstruction or mastoid cavity obliteration "open" or "closed" technique should not be opposed anymore. We call this a concept of "individualized approach or adapted technique in cholesteatoma surgery".

T1  - Bioactive glass granules for mastoid and epitympanic surgical obliteration: CT and MRI appearance
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the appearance of mastoid and epitympanic obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass (BG) granules in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and MRI. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients undergoing mastoid and epitympanic obliteration between May 2013 and December 2015 were prospectively included in an uncontrolled clinical study. All patients underwent a temporal HRCT scan 1 year after surgery, aimed at evaluating the attenuation, homogeneity, and osseointegration of the BG granules, as well as the ventilation of the middle ear and the volume of the obliterated paratympanic spaces. If a cholesteatoma was found during surgery, additional MRI, including at least pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and axial non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted (DW) sequences, was performed 1 year after surgery, to study the normal signal of the BG granules and the presence of residual cholesteatoma and/or other temporal bone pathologies. Result(s): Seventy cases were included. On 1-year HRCT, the mean attenuation of the BG granules was 888.34 +/- 166.10 HU. The obliteration was found to be mostly homogeneous with partial osseointegration. The appearance of the BG granules having a low-intensity signal in T2-weighted imaging and DW MRI was always different from the appearance of cholesteatoma. A longer follow-up has shown no attenuation or signal modification of the BG granules compared with the 1-year imaging. Conclusion(s): Radiological follow-up of patients operated on with mastoid and epitympanic obliteration using BG granules is effective using both HRCT and MRI. A cholesteatoma and/or other potential complications could easily be detected due to the specific radiological appearance of the BG granules. Key Points: * The appearance of mastoid and epitympanic obliteration by S53P4 bioactive glass (BG) granules on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans was homogeneous with an attenuation significantly higher than the attenuation of cholesteatoma and lower than mastoid bone attenuation. * The granules have a low-intensity signal on non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted sequences and on T2-weighted images and present contrast enhancement allowing the differential diagnosis with cholesteatoma and effective for the detection of other underlying temporal bone pathologies. * The volume and radiological appearance of the obliteration appear to be stable with time.Copyright Â© 2019, European Society of Radiology.

T1  - Titanium ossicular chain reconstruction in single stage canal wall down tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media with mucosa defect
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate surgical outcomes for chronic otitis media with mucosa defect underwent titanium ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) in single stage canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWD). Method(s): A clinical retrospective study was performed on 83 cases of the chronic otitis media with mucosa defect and 123 ears with mucosa integrity according to intraoperative findings that underwent synchronous titanium OCR in single stage CWD form January 2012 to January 2018. Pre- and postoperative air conduction threshold (AC), air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG closure at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were investigated. Result(s): The overall mean AC threshold of 53.4 +/- 16.5 dB was lowered to 41.2 +/- 15.9 dB postoperatively (p < 0.01). The mean pre- and postoperative ABG of all patients were 27.9 +/- 9.9 dB and 17.2 +/- 9.3 dB (p < 0.01), respectively, with a mean ABG closure of 10.7 +/- 8.4 dB. The total rate of success, postoperative ABG <= 20 dB was achieved in 71.4%. In the mucosa defect group underwent TORP, the mean pre- and postoperative ABG were 28.1 +/- 9.8 dB and 20.1 +/- 9.0 dB (p < 0.01), respectively, with the ABG closure was 8.0 +/- 7.9 dB. In the mucosa defect group underwent PORP, the mean pre- and postoperative ABG were 27.9 +/- 10.1 dB and 16.5 +/- 9.1 dB (p < 0.01), respectively, with the ABG closure was 11.4 +/- 8.6 dB. Furthermore, in the mucosa defect group, there was significant difference in success rate of achieved postoperative ABG <= 20 dB between the TORP (48.9%) and PORP (77.5%) (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): It is revealed PORP in single stage CWD tympanoplasty for the patients suffered from chronic otitis media with mucosa defect is favored.Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

T1  - Congenital cholesteatomas
AB  - Objective: In this study, congenital cholesteatoma cases that were diagnosed and surgically treated in our clinic are presented and discussed in the light of the current literature. Material(s) and Method(s): Clinical records of seven patients (four males and three females, aged between 6 and 49 years), operated for congenital cholesteatoma between 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. None of the cases had a history of previous surgical intervention or chronic otitis media. All patients were evaluated with audiogram, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Result(s): Five cases presented with a progressive conductive hearing loss, whereas one patient with tinnitus and another with ear pain. Otoscopic examination showed that tympanic membranes were intact in all cases. In two cases, a white mass causing bulging of the tympanic membrane was seen behind the eardrum. There was a hearing loss in all, but three cases. A canal wall up mastoidectomy was done on two patients, three patients had a modified radical mastoidectomy one patient had a transcanal atticotomy with ossiculoplasty, and one patient had a modified transotic approach. Four patients had stage three, two patients had stage four, and one patient had stage two congenital cholesteatomas. Postoperative early complications were not seen in any of the patient. Conclusion(s): Congenital cholesteatoma can be diagnosed after observation of a white colored mass behind the tympanic membrane either in patients presenting with hearing loss or during routine examination. However, in most patients, this finding cannot be observed. For this reason, especially in young patients with a normal looking tympanic membrane and a conductive hearing loss, the possibility of congenital cholesteatoma should be kept in mind.

T1  - Five-year postoperative outcomes of modified staged canal wall up tympanoplasty for primary acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: For successful canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT) for the treatment of cholesteatoma, the restoration of stable middle ear aeration is also important; however, little is known about the dynamics of such aeration or the optimal surgical procedure. In this study, alternative additional surgical procedure was selected based on the grade of middle ear aeration during the second-stage operation. Subjects and methods: Patients included in this study underwent staged CWUT surgeries with mastoid cortex plasty (MCP) for well-aerated ears (grade 3) and bony mastoid obliteration (BMO) for poorly aerated ears (grade 2-0). Of the 115 ears included in this study, 62 were followed for more than 5 years. Recurrence rates with deep retraction pocket formation were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The aeration was graded as: 0, no aeration; 1, aeration of only the mesotympanum; 2, aeration of the entire tympanic cavity; and 3, aeration of both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. Result(s): No recurrence was observed in ears associated with grade 3 aeration that underwent MCP or in ears with grade 2 aeration that underwent BMO during second-stage surgery. For grades 0 and 1 aeration ears, the recurrence rates were 8.1% after 5 years and 12.5% after 10 years (p < 0.05), and the aeration of recurrent ears deteriorated to grade 0. Conclusion(s): Aeration during second-stage surgery predicts the final outcome.Copyright Â© 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T1  - Posterior canal wall reposition for management of cholesteatoma: Technique and results
AB  - Objective: The main goal of surgery in acquired middle ear cholesteatomas is the complete eradication of the disease with an ear free of discharge. This can be performed either by open or closed techniques with their benefits and drawbacks. We present the technique of reposition of the posterior canal wall for the management of cholesteatoma cases and its results and outcome. Patients and Methods: This study included 31 patients with primary acquired middle ear cholesteatoma. The surgical technique included complete cortical mastoidectomy, wide posterior tympanotomy, dividing the bony posterior meatal wall with a micro-sagittal saw and its removal, dissection and eradication of cholesteatoma, and repositioning the canal wall segment in its anatomical site. Result(s): No significant intraoperative complication occurred. An injury to the dura occurred in one patient. Damage of the bony posterior canal wall occurred in two patients during saw cutting. Residual cholesteatoma was found in two patients. No dislocation or necrosis of the reconstructed posterior canal wall was noted and the new reconstructed external ear canal appeared to be of near normal size, shape, and contour. Conclusion(s): This technique provides optimal surgical exposure and access to areas that are difficult to reach by CWU approach, allows removal of the cholesteatoma without intraoperative complications, decreases the rate of residual cholesteatoma, restores near-normal anatomy of the external auditory canal, and avoids the sequelae of the open mastoid cavity. Therefore, it would be a feasible alternative to the standard CWU and CWD procedures.Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

T1  - Management of benign middle ear tumors: A series of 7 cases
AB  - Benign middle ear tumors represent a rare group of neoplasms that vary widely in their pathology, anatomy, and clinical findings. These factors have made it difficult to establish guidelines for the resection of such tumors. Here we present 7 unique cases of these rare and diverse tumors and draw from our experience to recommend optimal surgical management. Based on our experience, a postauricular incision is necessary in nearly all cases. Mastoidectomy is required for tumors that extend into the mastoid cavity. Whenever exposure or hemostasis is believed to be inadequate with simple mastoidectomy, canal-wall-down mastoidectomy should be performed. Finally, disarticulation of the ossicular chain greatly facilitates tumor excision and should be performed early in the procedure.Copyright Â© 2016 Vendome Group, LLC.

T1  - The role of subtotal petrosectomy in cochlear implant recipients
AB  - Describe the indications and outcome of subtotal petrosectomy for cochlear implant recipients. Tertiary care referral center. This is a retrospective study of all subtotal petrosectomies and cochlear implants performed between January 2012 and December 2014. We review the charts of these patients collecting the following data: age, gender, otologic history, audiologic tests, indication of subtotal petrosectomy, data of surgery, surgical and immediate complications, late complications and follow-up of for at least 2.5 years. 12 cases of subtotal petrosectomies with cochlear implantation in 11 patients were performed during this period; 2 children and 10 adults. The indication for a cochlear implant was in 10 cases bilateral severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss and in the remaining 2 cases was asymmetric hearing loss or unilateral hearing loss. The reason for performing a subtotal petrosectomy was chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, radical cavities from previous surgeries or electrode extrusion of previously implanted devices. All cases were performed in one stage. One patient had an infectious complication that required revision surgery and finally an explantation. No other complications are described. Subtotal petrosectomy combined with cochlear implantation is a procedure required in certain situations. It is an effective and safe procedure for managing middle ear problems and creating a safe cavity to receive a cochlear implant either in adults and children.Copyright Â© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

T1  - One stage posterior canal wall reconstruction with conchal cartilage in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - This study incorporates 352 patients, who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy followed by canal wall reconstruction using conchal cartilage at SMGS Hospital, Govt medical college, Jammu. Out of 352 patients, 198(56.25%) were males and 154(43.75%) were females with 242(68.75%) cases having bilateral pathology. Posterosuperior pathology was seen in 43.75% patients while 31.25% had attic pathology. Aural polyp was seen in 15.62% and mesotympanic pathology was seen in 9.38%. 87.5% patients had an Air Bone gap of greater than 20dB preopeatively and postoperatively72.72% had an airbone gap of <20dB. One stage PCW reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery is a safe procedure for the management of cholesteatoma as a CWD technique is followed which helps in adequate exposure and wide eradication of the disease and when reconstruction of PCW is done a faster healing and lower morbidity is observed as patient is now free from cavity.Copyright Â© 2017, JK Science.

T1  - Day-case management of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma with canal wall down technique surgery: Long-term follow-up
AB  - The overall number of day-case otologic surgery cases is increasing; however, there is limited experience about performing canal wall down tympanoplasty in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma in this setting. The objective of this study was to assess the success of this technique as daycase surgery in terms of results and complications over an 8-year follow up period. We included in this study 42 patients undergoing canal wall down technique tympanoplasty surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma performed as day cases during a 2-year period. 30 cases (71.4%) were discharged on the day of surgery, whereas 12 cases (28.6%) were hospitalized and discharged the day after. The principal reasons for failure of discharge on the day of surgery were asthenia (6 cases), vertigo and asthenia (4 cases), undetermined (2 cases). Based on our experience, with a proper preoperative selection, assessment and screening of the patients, mastoidectomy with timpanoplasty for chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma can be carried out in a day surgery setting with no significant effects on effectiveness of surgery, post-operative symptoms and relapse of disease even in the long term.Copyright Â© G.

T1  - Anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration with bioactive glass s53p4: a prospective clinical study
AB  - Objective: To analyse the anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results when using bioactive glass in mastoid and epitympanic obliteration. Design(s): Prospective clinical study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral centre. Participant(s): Forty-one cases (39 patients) operated between May 2013 and January 2015. Main Outcome Measure(s): Anatomical results were evaluated by otomicroscopy 1 year after surgery and using imaging to detect residual disease. Functional results were studied by postoperative hearing gain. Quality of life was assessed with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire and the success of surgery by a surgery-specific questionnaire. Result(s): At 1 year, all patients presented a well-healed external auditory canal, with an intact tympanic membrane. In cases with cholesteatoma (n = 23), no recurrent retraction pockets or residual disease were observed on imaging studies. The overall air-bone gap closure was 7.7 +/- 1.84 dB (mean +/- se of the mean, P < 0.001, paired t-test). No significant differences were found on hearing results when comparing primary versus revision surgery, canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down obliterations, type of tympanoplasty and presence of cholesteatoma (multifactor anova). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory improved with an average score of 28 and the success of surgery questionnaire showed a significant improvement in ear discharge and a moderate improvement in hearing and equilibrium. Conclusion(s): The use of bioactive glass for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal-wall-down or canal-wall-up tympanoplasties is an effective procedure in both primary and revision surgery. The anatomical and functional results appear to be well correlated with patient experience and to the improvement in quality of life.Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

T1  - Canal reconstruction and mastoid obliteration using floating cartilages and musculoperiosteal flaps
AB  - Objectives: To reduce the mastoid cavity-associated problems secondary to canal wall down mastoidectomy, we designed a new surgical procedure that includes canal wall reconstruction using free-floating cartilages and double musculoperiosteal flaps. Study Design: Retrospective study. Material(s) and Method(s): Thirty-three patients were enrolled in this study. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry/speech discrimination score and postoperative status (complications and EAC status) were analyzed. Result(s): Air conduction thresholds were statistically improved (P = 0.008). The air-bone gap was significantly reduced following surgery (P = 0.001). There were no other major complications in any of the patients. Long-term follow-up demonstrated gradual widening of the neo-EAC in 18 patients (54.5%) but normal contour of the neo-EAC in the other 13 patients (39.4%). In just one case did the neo-EAC become extremely widened. Conclusion(s): Mastoid obliteration and canal wall reconstruction using free-floating cartilages and double musculoperiosteal flaps is very useful to achieve optimal surgical view, eliminate the middle ear pathology, and prevent recurrence of cholesteatoma and cavity problem.

T1  - Reconstruction of lateral attic wall in acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Background/Aim. Attic cholesteatoma is an epithelial cystic pseudotumor which arises in the top compartment of the middle ear. Surgery is the only therapeutic treatment for attic cholesteatoma. The aim of this study was to analyze the surgical and audiological results in tympanoplasties that use a logical application of several techniques for the management of attic cholesteatoma. Our hypothesis was that the tympanoplasty technique with cartilage/bone reconstruction of the achieve better outcome than the tympanoplasty technique with only temporal fascia reconstruction of the lateral attic wall. Methods. This retrospective clinical study included 80 patients, aged 16-65 years, with attic cholesteatoma undergoing canal "wall up" tympanoplasty with lateral attic wall reconstruction, under general anesthesia in the Eear, Nose and Throat Clinic, Military Medical Academy in Belgrade between 2006 and 2010. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type of lateral attic wall reconstruction: the group I of 60 patients with cartilage/bone plus temporalis fascia lateral attic wall reconstruction and the group II of 20 patients with only temporal fascia lateral attic wall reconstruction. Postoperative follow-up examinations were done at least 5 years after the surgery. The chi2 test was used to compare postoperative sequelae for two groups of operated patients with lateral attic wall reconstruction. The independent and paired samples t-test of air conduction and air-bone gap were used to compare the results of preoperative and postoperative hearing tests. Results. The differences between hearing measurements of the two groups according to preoperative and postoperative auditory thresholds of the air conduction and the air-bone gap were considered no statistically significant. The difference between the two groups recarding to recurrent attic retraction pocket appearance and recurrence of cholesteatoma was considered statistically significant and the results were much better in the group I of the operated patients with cartilage/ bone lateral attic wall reconstruction. Conclusion. "Wall up" tympanoplasty for attic cholesteatoma with lateral attic wall reconstruction leads to good anatomical and audiological results. A significant hearing improvement was obtained in both the types of lateral attic wall reconstructions in this study. Reconstruction with cartilage or mastoid cortex bone showed favorably long-term functional and anatomical results compared to primary tympanoplasty using only temporal fascia for lateral attic wall reconstruction in cases of attic cholesteatoma.Copyright Â© 2017, Institut za Vojnomedicinske Naucne Informacije/Documentaciju.

T1  - Incidence, 10-year recidivism rate and prognostic factors for cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: Cholesteatoma patients have a high risk of recurrence with complications, and knowledge exchange is a prerequisite for improving treatment. This study aimed to apply appropriate statistics to provide meaningful and transferable results from cholesteatoma surgery, to highlight independent prognostic factors, and to assess the incidence rate. Method(s): Incidence rates were assessed for the district of Aarhus, Denmark. From 147 patients operated on mainly with canal wall up mastoidectomies for debuting cholesteatomas, 10-year Kaplan-Meier recidivism rates were calculated and independent prognostic factors for the recidivism were identified by Cox multivariate regression analyses. Result(s): Incidence rate was 6.8 per 100 000 per year. The 10-year cumulative recidivism rate was 0.44 (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.37-0.53). Independent prognostic factors for the recidivism were: age below 15 years (hazard ratio = 2.2; p > z = 0.002), cholesteatoma localised to the mastoid (hazard ratio = 1.7; p > z = 0.04), stapes erosion (hazard ratio = 1.9; p > z = 0.02) and incus erosion (hazard ratio = 1.9; p > z = 0.04). Conclusion(s): The recidivism rate is influenced by several factors that are important to observe, both in the clinic and when comparing results from surgery.Copyright Â© 2017 JLO (1984) Limited.

T1  - Long-term Complications and Surgical Failures After Ossiculoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study long-term complications after ossiculoplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center otology practice. PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-five patients (18-88 yr of age) undergoing ossiculoplasty with tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy using cartilage tympanic membrane grafts, retrograde mastoidectomy with canal wall reconstruction, or mastoid obliteration techniques between July 1998 and July 2012. The studied patients all had at least 3 years of clinical follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of long-term complications, including need for revision surgery, need for secondary ventilation tube placement, recurrence of conductive hearing loss (and related etiologies), recurrent cholesteatoma, and delayed graft failure (recurrent tympanic membrane perforation). RESULTS: Long-term complications were observed in 10.3% (20/195) of patients. 8.2% (16/195) required revision surgery, 10.2% (17/195) required secondary ventilation tube placement, 3.6% (7/195) experienced recurrence of conductive hearing loss, 4.1% (8/195) had delayed failure of tympanic membrane graft, and 1.5% (3/195) had recurrence of cholesteatoma. Recurrence of conductive hearing loss was caused by the displacement of prosthesis in 3 of 7 patients and extensive scar tissue formation without prosthesis displacement in 4 of 7 patients. Seventy-two percent obtained a postoperative pure-tone average - air-bone gap < 20 dB. Forty-eight percent (93/195) obtained a hearing result worse than expected based on the ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging index. CONCLUSION: Long-term complications are a significant consideration in all the patients undergoing ossiculoplasty. Our data suggest that tobacco smoking, Eustachian tube dysfunction, and an unexpectedly poor hearing result on the first postoperative audiogram are all important risk factors for the development of significant complications.

T1  - Cholesteatoma management in children with down syndrome
AB  - Objectives: The high prevalence of chronic otitis media with effusion and Eustachian tube dysfunction in Down syndrome (DS) patients can predispose to cholesteatoma formation, with potential for extensive disease. The clinical course and management of cholesteatoma in children with DS pose challenges relative to small ear canals and poorly aerated mastoid cavities. The objectives were to assess the incidence, treatment strategies, and outcomes of cholesteatoma management in children with DS. Method(s): A retrospective case series of children with DS who underwent tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma removal at a tertiary care medical center between January 1, 2008, and June 30, 2016. Result(s): Sixteen ears in 14 patients, 11 (78.6%) male and 8 (57.1%) left-sided, with DS were analyzed. Fourteen ears (85.7%) had at least 2 tympanostomy tube placements prior to tympanomastoidectomy. The average age at first tympanomastoidectomy was 9.6 years (range 1.4-18.4 years). An average of 1.75 surgeries (range 1-5), including 5 canal-wall-down procedures, were needed to clear the disease. Average followup after surgery was 3.76 years (range 0.41-16.5 years). Postoperatively, 2 (12.5%) ears developed new retraction pockets, 3 (18.8%) ears developed recurrent disease, and 2 (12.5%) ears were noted to have residual disease. Ossiculoplasty was performed in 5 (31.3%) patients with a postoperative pure-tone average of 48 decibels (range 10-80 decibels). Thirteen ears (81.2%) were fitted with a hearing aid. Conclusion(s): Cholesteatoma excision can be performed successfully in DS patients with comparable recurrence and residual disease rates to the general population. Many patients benefitted from hearing aid placement.

T1  - Recidivsim of mastoiditis after primary mastoidectomy
AB  - Objectives: (1) To determine the incidence of mastoiditis recurrence requiring revision surgery in patients receiving primary mastoidectomy. (2) To analyze patient characteristics and comorbidities associated with recidivism or failure. Method(s): This is a descriptive retrospective case series of patients aged 15 to 89 years receiving canal-wall-up mastoidectomy without tympanoplasty (Current Procedural Terminology code 69502), excluding cholesteatoma, performed by the primary investigator between January 1, 2007, and April 30, 2016. The outcome of interest is recurrence of mastoiditis requiring revision mastoidectomy. Patient characteristics and comorbidities include age, gender, race, ethnicity, preferred language, geographical location, sinusitis, rhinitis, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and autoimmune disease. Data were analyzed using proportional-hazards models, Pearson chi2 tests, and generalized linear models. Result(s): There were 128 eligible ears from 115 patients identified during the study period. Of these ears, 17 (13.3%) required revision surgery. The mean time to failure was 274.6 days (+/-151.9; range, 83-679 days). The incidence rate of surgery failure is 0.107 per 1000 person-days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067-0.172). The proportion of failures was somewhat higher among female than male patients (female: 16/74; male: 5/54); however, this difference was not statistically significant (P = .062). No demographic or comorbidity variables were statistically significantly associated with mastoidectomy failure (P > .05). Because of small sample sizes, we did not have sufficient power to conclusively determine a lack of effect. Conclusion(s): We report the incidence of recidivism of mastoiditis in this population. This will help otolaryngologists report expected rates of failure to patients receiving mastoidectomy. A larger study is required to confirm if patient comorbidities or characteristics are statistically significant.

T1  - Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Surgical Complications following Cochlear Implantation in Canal Wall Down Mastoid Cavities
AB  - Objective We sought to assess the complication rates following cochlear implantation in canal wall down mastoid cavities in adults and children. Data Sources A systematic review of English articles from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Additional studies were identified by reviewing the reference lists of the originally identified studies. Review Methods Studies were included that reported on surgical outcomes following cochlear implantation in canal wall down mastoid cavities. Two authors, using predefined data fields, independently reviewed all articles while tabulating study quality indicators. A meta-analysis of proportions was conducted on select cohorts to determine weighted complication rates. Results Forty-two articles were included that accounted for 424 patients and described surgical outcomes following cochlear implantation in canal wall down mastoid cavities. In a comparison of the postoperative complication rates, overclosing the external auditory meatus had significantly fewer global complications than did maintaining a canal wall down mastoid cavity (P =.027). In a comparison of the complication rates (1) between staging the cochlear implantation and performing external auditory meatus overclosure simultaneously with cochlear implantation and (2) between pediatric and adult cochlear implantation recipients with external auditory meatus overclosure, there were no significant differences (P =.085 and P =.92, respectively). Conclusion Overclosing the external auditory meatus at the same time of cochlear implantation leads to significantly fewer complications when compared with maintaining a canal wall down mastoid cavity with soft tissue coverage of the electrode array.Copyright Â© American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2016.

T1  - Subtotal petrosectomy for cochlear implantation: Lessons learned after 110 cases
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to review the indications for subtotal petrosectomy for cochlear implantation, report our management of complications, as well as review those technical factors that are critical for successful implantation. Method(s): Patients (n = 104) that underwent subtotal petrosectomy with closure of the external auditory canal and obliteration of the cavity with abdominal fat in combination with cochlear implantation were analyzed. Result(s): The most frequent indication for subtotal petrosectomy was the existence of a previous canal wall down technique. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (11.83%). Extrusion of the device took place in 5 cases (4.55%). Conclusion(s): Subtotal petrosectomy in cochlear implantation permits obtaining a cavity isolated from the external environment, and when needed, it improves the access and visibility during the surgical procedure. Subtotal petrosectomy is a safe technique, with a low rate of complications.Copyright Â© SAGE Publications.

T1  - Hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery stratified for exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal and transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery (CWD) and to analyze the impact of ossicular reconstruction technique (partial ossicular replacement prostheses/PORP and total ossicular replacement prostheses/TORP) on hearing outcome. This study is a retrospective case review and clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. Patients who underwent 376 cholesteatoma surgeries (2007-2009) and 92 ears in clinical re-examination at least 12 months postoperatively were included. Sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM, or CWD; ossiculoplasty with PORP or TORP were the interventions administered. Pre- and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and air conduction threshold (AC) for 0.5-3 kHz were the main outcome measures. Overall, the mean preoperative ABG decreased from 25.3 +/- 1.3 to 19.8 +/- 0.9 dB with a mean ABG closure of 5.4 +/- 1.3 dB (p <= 0.001). According to surgical technique, the postoperative ABG after CWD 23.5 +/- 2.1 was significantly worse compared to ETC (17.3 +/- 1.0 dB, p < 0.05) and TCM (19.4 +/- 1.3 dB). A significant ABG closure was observed after ETC (6.8 +/- 2.0 dB, p < 0.01) and TCM (6.5 +/- 2.0 dB, p < 0.01) contrary to CWD (2.1 +/- 2.9 dB, p > 0.05). Patients receiving PORP showed a significantly less ABG postoperatively (19.0 +/- 0.9 dB, p <= 0.05) compared to the TORP group (24.1 +/- 2.5 dB). However, a significant hearing gain was assessed after PORP- (4.7 +/- 1.6 dB, p <= 0.01) and TORP- implantation (10.4 +/- 3.7 dB, p <= 0.01). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery allowed for an excellent hearing outcome postoperatively. An intact posterior canal wall and a present stapes suprastructure were identified to predict a significantly superior hearing result. In addition to the technical and prosthetic considerations, the audiological outcome was confounded by the attending middle ear pathology.Copyright Â© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

T1  - The economic impact of revision otologic surgery
AB  - Revision otologic surgery places a significant economic burden on patients and the healthcare system. We conducted a retrospective chart analysis to estimate the economic impact of revision canal-wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomy. We reviewed the medical records of all 189 adults who had undergone CWD mastoidectomy performed by the senior author between June 2006 and August 2011 at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill. Institutional charges and collections for all patients were extrapolated to estimate the overall healthcare cost of revision surgery in Illinois and at the national level. Of the 189 CWD mastoidectomies, 89 were primary and 100 were revision procedures. The total charge for the revision cases was $2,783,700, and the net reimbursement (collections) was $846,289 (30.4%). Using Illinois Hospital Association data, we estimated that reimbursement for 387 revision CWD mastoidectomies that had been performed in fiscal year 2011 was nearly $3.3 million. By extrapolating our data to the national level, we estimated that 9,214 patients underwent revision CWD mastoidectomy in the United States during 2011, which cost the national healthcare system roughly $76 million, not including lost wages and productivity. Known causes of failed CWD mastoidectomies that often result in revision surgery include an inadequate meatoplasty, a facial ridge that is too high, residual diseased air cells, and recurrent cholesteatoma. A better understanding of these factors can reduce the need for revision surgery, which could have a positive impact on the economic strain related to this procedure at the local, state, and national levels.Copyright Â© 2016 Vendome Group, LLC All rights reserved.

T1  - Efficacy of Posterior Canal Wall Reconstruction Using Autologous Auricular Cartilage and Bone Pate in Chronic Otitis Media with Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to investigate the long-term results using the technique of canal wall up mastoidectomy and reconstruction of the posterior canal wall using bone pate and auricular cartilage in the treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on 42 patients who underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy and posterior canal wall reconstruction at a single institution between November 2005 and November 2012. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, postoperative tympanic membranes were normal in 38 (90.5%), perforated in 1 (2.4%), and retracted in 3 (7.1%). Mean preoperative and postoperative values of the air-bone gap (ABG) were 29.4+/-12.8 and 23.4+/-11.7 dB, respectively, which represented a significant average improvement. For patients with ossiculoplasty (n=24), the mean preoperative and postoperative ABG values were 34.7+/-6.0 and 27.5+/-8.0 dB, respectively, which also represented a significant average improvement. Thirty-one (73.8%) of the patients were followed up without any complication, but 5 had otorrhea (11.9%), 4 had dizziness (9.5%), and 2 had facial palsy (4.8%). CONCLUSION: A canal wall up mastoidectomy with reconstruction of the posterior canal wall using auricular cartilage and bone pate provides successful preservation of the anatomic structure and a significant improvement in hearing without the long-term disadvantages of a canal wall down mastoidectomy.

T1  - Congenital Cholesteatoma of middle ear in children (14 cases experience)
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: To investigate the clinical features of Congenital Cholesteatoma (CC) of middle ear in children and provide methods for early diagnosis. Method(s): A retrospective chart review of 94 patients with a diagnosis of middle ear cholesteatoma, in Beijing Children's Hospital, between 2009 and 2015 was carried on. 14 patients with CC were identified using the criteria proposed by Levenson and Pariser, and were divided into two groups according to the course of disease. The main complains, diagnostic methods and Potsic's stage of temporal bone CT findings were recorded. Result(s): 1) 11/14 (78.57%) patients with CC were boys, with a median age of 7.20 years (from 3.33 to 10.17 years). 2) Hearing loss (13/14, 92.86%) was the most common complain. Finding methods included hearing test and CT scan (11/14, 78.57%), tympanotomy (2/14, 14.28%) and otoscopic examination(1/14,7.14%). 3) The preoperative Air-Bone conduction threshold Gap (ABG) was 40.46+/- 8.86 dB. According to the course of disease, patients with CC were divided into two groups (A 6/14, B 8/14). There was no significant difference in preoperative ABGs (38.10+/-7.43 dB & 42.09 +/-9.96 dB, P= 0.427). 4) According to Potsic's stage among A, B groups(P = 0.043). 5) Modified canal wall up mastoidectomy was the preferred procedure and 11/14 (78.57%) patients had this surgery done. In 6 patients followed up, the difference between pre-ABG and post-ABG(36.26 +/- 5.56 dB & 21.70 +/- 3.80 dB, P = 0.004) was significant. Conclusion(s): CC of middle ear in children happened more in boys than in girls. Hearing loss was the most common complaint. The shorter was the course of disease , the less damage of the structure of middle ear would be. Hearing test, CT, tympanotomy and otoscopic examination were usually used for diagnosis.

T1  - Predictive factors for recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: To enhance understanding of the factors which contribute to development of recurrent cholesteatoma in children as part of the Round Table session on Paediatric Cholesteatoma. Predictive factors for recurrent cholesteatoma Recurrent cholesteatoma (i.e. development of new disease after previous surgical clearance) may be a consequence of persistent pathogenetic factors and perhaps also of surgical technique. Cholesteatoma is commonly considered to behave more aggressively in children than adults. A clear understanding of factors that predispose to recurrent disease in children may help selection of optimal surgical technique for disease control for example between canal wall up (CWU) or down (CWD) and mastoid preservation or obliteration. In an attempt to clarify this relationship between disease, patient and surgery, a single-surgeon prospective database of consecutive cholesteatoma surgeries was analysed. Analysis was restricted to cases with no prior history of cholesteatoma surgery. Out of 368 paediatric cases, 328 (89%) were completed with CWU of which 69 were totally endoscopic (TEES), and 40 were completed with CWD of which 10 had primary obliteration. Overall 34 (9%) were found to develop recurrent cholesteatoma. Kaplan Meier survival (KM) analysis was used to control for the cumulative increase in recurrence with time, giving an overall recurrence rate of 12% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years. Perhaps surprisingly, KM analysis suggests that gender and younger age had no impact on likelihood of recurrence. Similarly the same rate of recurrence was found for congenital and acquired cholesteatoma and whether disease was acquired from pars tensa or pars flaccida retraction. The most significant pre-operative determinant of outcome was extent of cholesteatoma, with cholesteatoma involving 4 sub-sites (meso-and epitympanum, antrum and mastoid) having significantly greater risk of recurrence than smaller disease (30% at 5 years; KM log rank statistic p = 0.002). While canal wall down surgery (CWD) is commonly considered to have a lower risk of recurrence than intact canal wall surgery (CWU), in this series, KM analysis showed no difference in rate of recurrent cholesteatoma between these different techniques. Subgroup analysis, in which the sample sizes are small, suggests (a) the same recurrence rate with TEES and (b) no difference in revision surgery for uncontrolled disease for CWD cases with or without obliteration of the mastoid. In contrast to the perhaps unreachable gold-standard of a randomized prospective trial to control for differences between patients, it must be noted that selection of surgical technique was allocated according to patient and disease factors, for example CWD surgery was used more often for larger cholesteatoma. Careful recording and analysis of surgical intervention and outcome provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of otologic intervention for cholesteatoma. Survival analysis is required to control for the increasing incidence with longer follow up. It is also important to control for other risk factors such as the extent of cholesteatoma. Understanding of the mechanisms of recurrent cholesteatoma is confounded by selection of surgical technique according to the extent of disease. Nevertheless, as it seems that "Bad ears do badly and good ears do well" it is arguably most important maximise strategies to prevent recurrent disease in those thought to be most at risk.

T1  - The benefits and expectations using mastoid reconstruction and obliteration technique
AB  - Learning Objectives: Mastoid obliteration with posterior wall reconstruction techniques gained much popularity among the mastoid surgeon in recent years. The results published in the literature are promissing ranging between 0-15% cholesteatoma recurrences. Because of its aggressivity and irreversibility, radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma was totally abandoned in some institutions. This presentation describes our attitude toward this surgical trend. Method(s): The experience of the author includes 114 patients operated since 2008. The follow-up ranged between 12 months and 8 years (mean of six year and 5 months). Sixty-nine primary procedures (i.e., no previous mastoidectomy) and 45 secondary procedures (more than one previous mastoidectomy) were performed. Autologous bone was used for posterior wall reconstruction and bone pate' was used for mastoid obliteration. The results of cholesteatoma recurrences and the rate of dry ear were evaluated and compared in the two groups of patients. Result(s): There were 18 cases of recurrent cholesteatoma in the total group (15.8%). Seven of them in the primary group (10.1%) and 11 in the secondary group (24.4%). Nine patients had a stubborn cholesteatoma, 4 patients of those were operated more than 3 times. Two patients finally underwent radical mastoidectomy. All cholesteatoma were located in the middle ear and no one in the obliterated mastoid. Dry ear with no need for taking precautions against water was achived in 53 of the primary group of patients (76.8%) compared to 29 in the secondary group of patients (64.4%). Conclusion(s): Reconstruction techniques of the posterior wall and obliteration of the mastoid had first appeared to be the "promised land" of a solution for mastoid cholesteatoma, and raised the hopes that radical mastoidectomy surgery could be abandoned. With more experience, however it emerged that this held true solely for primary surgery. The surgical outcomes for cases of secondary cholesteatoma were worse than those achived in radical mastoidectomy. Thus, radical mastoidectomy is still indicated for stubborn cholesteatoma.

T1  - Direct cost comparison of totally endoscopic versus open ear surgery
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: The introduction of new surgical techniques requires not only an evaluation of safety and clinical efficacy but also cost justification. Totally Endoscopic Ear Surgery (TEES) is a relatively new technique for managing chronic ear disease. The cost of specialised equipment required may be a barrier to implementation of the technique. This study aims to test the null hypothesis that open and endoscopic approaches have similar direct costs for the management of attic cholesteatoma in an Australian private hospital setting. Study Design: A retrospective direct cost comparison from a hospital perspective, of TEES and traditional canal wall up mastoidectomy for the management of attic cholesteatoma in the private tertiary setting was undertaken. Indirect and future costs were excluded. Method(s): A cost comparison of anaesthetic set up and resources, operative set up and resources, average cost of running an operating theatre and cost of overnight admission was performed between the two techniques. Result(s): TEES has a mean reduction of AUD$2998.63 per operation from the hospital perspective when compared to an open procedure for attic cholesteatoma. Conclusion(s): Once the learning curve is achieved, TEES is more cost effective from a hospital perspective, than canal wall up mastoidectomy for attic cholesteatoma. When indirect and future costs are considered as well, the economic gain of managing attic cholesteatoma endoscopically could possibly be even greater.

T1  - Back to the future: The evolution of cholesteatoma diagnosis and management
AB  - Confucius once said, "Study the past if you would define the future." As an introduction to the 10th International Conference on Cholesteatoma and Ear Surgery, the American Neurotology Society has assembled panelists (Mr. David Moffat (Addenbrooks Hospital), Dr. Jack Lane (Mayo Clinic), Dr. Clough Shelton (U. of Utah), Dr. Moises Arriaga (LSU) and Dr. Dennis Poe (Harvard) to discuss the evolution of cholesteatoma diagnosis and management. Dr. John McElveen (Carolina Ear Research Institute) will moderate the panel. Mr. Moffat will trace the history of the diagnosis of cholesteatoma from ancient times to the present. Based on the research in 1967 by McKenzie and Brothwell, the existence of chronic suppurative otitis media in prehistoric times has been clearly documented. It was the French anatomist Joseph-Guichard Du Verney who in 1683 first described a temporal bone tumour which was probably a cholesteatoma. However, the term, "cholesteatoma", was first used by Johannes Peter Muller in 1838. Although a misnomer, it has continued to be used to describe "keratomas" involving the temporal bone and skull base. Abramson et al in 1977 provided a more detailed definition of cholesteatomas at the First International Conference on Cholesteatoma. The classification of cholesteatoma into congenital and acquired and the latter's subdivision into primary and secondary acquired was the natural sequel of refinements in diagnostic capability which accompanied the use of the microscope both in histopathology and in the clinical examination of the ear (Nylen, 1921). Since the dawn of medical imaging, radiographic examination of the temporal bone has been used in the evaluation and management of cholesteatoma. X-ray modalities have evolved from plain radiographs (1900-1940s) to polytomography (1950-60s) to single slice Computed Tomography (CT) acquired separately in the axial and coronal planes (1970-1980s) to multislice CT with multiplanarreconstruction (1990-2010s). MR with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (1990-2000s) has been employed most effectively in the detection of recurrent cholesteatoma, particularly in the setting of canal wall up procedures. In some centers, DWI MR has obviated the need for many second look procedures. Dr. Lane will explore the evolution of these radiographic techniques and discuss recent advances in temporal bone imaging, including Photon Counting CT and high field MR (3 T and 7 T). These imaging modalities are anticipated to achieve greater degrees of resolution and sensitivity in the detection of acquired and congenital cholesteatomas involving the temporal bone. Just as imaging techniques have continued to evolve, so have the surgical techniques used to manage cholesteatomas. However, surgical management of cholesteatomas involving the temporal bone continues to be a source of some controversy. Some advocate a one stage procedure with revision of the failures. Others promote modern techniques for post-operative surveillance by employing imaging or endoscopic inspection. Dr. Shelton will discuss the surgical options currently used and review the rationale, controversy and history of the two stage strategy as advocated by the late JimSheehy. Skull base cholesteatomas can be particularly destructive and potentially life threatening. Dr. Arriaga will discuss the traditional and modified versions of skull base neurotologic approaches such as Middle Cranial Fossa, Middle Fossa Transpetrous (extended middle fossa), Retrolabyrinthine, Retrosigmoid and Translabyrinthine approaches. In addition, he will explore the use of four-hand skull base surgery techniques, fallopian bridge strategies and simultaneous application of the endoscope to microscopic visualization to deal with challenging skull base cholesteatomas. Dr. Poe will bring us "Back to the Future" with an update on the current understanding and treatment of Eustachian tube dysfunction as it relates to chronic otitis media. His focus will be on tubal dilatory dysfunction which typically involves the cartilaginous portion of the Eustachian tube. He will explore the use of Eustachian tuboplasty to treat tubal dysfunction and discuss its potential role in standard tympanoplastic and tympanomastoid procedures.

T1  - Use of a thinly sliced cartilage technique in a canal wall up procedures
AB  - Learning Objectives: We have performed canal-wall-down tympanoplasty reconstruction with soft posterior meatal wall for cholesteatoma as a single-stage operation from 1998 to 2009. Although this method designed to prevent a cholesteatoma recurrence, posterior meatal wall often retracts like balloon similar to that of conventional open method operation and it has sometimes caused cavity problems, in long-term follow-up. As you know, in approximately 80% of an anterior attic bony plate of pars flaccida is closed in cholesteatoma cases. As results ventilation routes from Eustachian tube to epitympanum and mastoid antrum are hard to be formed by the single staged operation. Therefore, after 2010, we decided to perform thinly sliced cartilage technique in a canal-wall-up procedure with planned staged tympanoplasty in many cases. Cartilage is used as perichondrium-cartilage island flap, and it includes treatment and prevention of attic retraction, reconstruction of scutum and reconstruction of tympanic membrane. This cartilage is the size enough to reconstruct scutum and an eardrum by one. The island flap is simple to use more than a way using both of a cartilage and a fascia. Because it's possible to reconstruct superior and posterior wall of EAM by one operative procedure.

T1  - The selection of surgical technique for middle ear cholesteatoma in pediatric patients
AB  - Learning Objectives: Method: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric primary acquired cholesteatoma aged 6-14 years old between May, 2005 and August, 2009 was conducted. 86 patients(89 ears) were treated and followed from 1 to 7 years[ the average is (3.8 +/- 2.5) years]. Result(s): During the follow-up, intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty(ICW) was the primary surgical treatment in 38 patients(38 ears) initially, the recidivism rate was 18%(7/38), 48 patients(51 ears) underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty(CWD), the recidivism rate was 6%(3/51), the achieved rate of PTA was 68%(35/51). Conclusion(s): ICWhad the advantage which could preserve the physical structure of external auditory canal, however, the cholesteatomas in pediatric patients are more wide spread and erosive. The surgery should completely remove the diseased tissues and then preserve the hearing. Surgical techniques should be depending on the lesions extension, generally the tympanoplasty with open technique was more suitable.

T1  - Surgical treatment of adult and paediatric cholesteatoma-A comparison of 6 years follow-up
AB  - Learning Objectives: The consistent performed and longterm follow-up after cholesteatoma surgery is essential for the evaluation and a prerequisite for a comparison of the surgical results. Introduction: The aim with the study was to present and compare data from two separate studies of a 6-years follow-up after cholesteatoma surgery in adults and children. Material(s) and Method(s): 301 adult-(330 ears) and 57 paediatric patients were operated for cholesteatoma. In all cases an identical one-stage canal-wall down-technique with reconstruction of the middle ear and mastoid obliteration using autologous bone was used. In the adult group 47% had previous surgery, in the paediatric group 7%. After surgery a standardized protocol for documentation of the intra-and postoperative findings and surgical steps including a sketch and the preoperative audiometric data-pure tone average (PTA) for air-and bone conduction threshold levels (0.5-3kHz)-were registered in the data based follow-up-program. All patients were examined annually after surgery and the surgical and the audiometric data fed into the program 1, 3 and 6 years after surgery. Result(s): In the adult group residual disease was found in 3%, in the paediatric group in 5%. The recurrence rate was 10% and 12%. Chain revisions were performed in 19% and 14%. The rate of the postoperative water resistance was 5% and 7%, the postoperative infection rate 3% and 0%. Long lasting improvement and/or preservation of hearing were obtained in both groups. The pre-and postoperative air conduction hearing levels were 45.8 dB and 35.8 dB in the adult group, in the paediatric group 33 dB and 25.5 dB. Conclusion(s): Independent of preoperative middle ear condition, cholesteatoma extent and localization, the used surgical technique provided a long-term improvement of hearing with a low incidence of residual and recurrent disease. No differences in outcome between adult and children were found.

T1  - Clinical analysis on surgery of middle ear cholesteatoma and chronic otitis media
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: To evaluate the choice of microsurgical treatment modalities and it's clinical effect on middle ear cholesteatoma and chronic suppurative otitis media. Method(s): 110 cases with middle ear and mastoid lesions including middle ear cholesteatoma and chronic suppurative otitis media were analysed which performed canal wall up mastoidectomy or at the same time tympanoplasty and canal wall down mastoidotympanectomy depending on lesion extent and followed-up, observed the ear recovery, complications, recurrence and postoperative hearing improvement. Result(s): 110 cases including 66 cases of middle ear cholesteatoma, 44 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, 51 canal wall up mastoidotympanectomy, 46 cases simultaneously followed by tympanoplasty, 59 canal wall down mastoidectomy, Intraoperative finding as followed auditory absence of bone destruction 36 cases including 7 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, 29 cases of middle ear cholesteatoma; 7 cases of complete auditory ossicles including 4 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, 3 cases of middle ear cholesteatoma; facial nerve canal bone destruction 22 cases, brain palate damaged and meningitis exposed in 13 cases. Conclusion(s): According to different lesions of middle ear and mastoid the specific disease in intraoperative, different operative methods can be used to obtain the corresponding clinical curative effect, the canal wall up mastoidectomy plus tympanoplasty, if indications mastered properly, the technical conditions permitted, can effectively keep the original middle ear mastoid anatomical structure and improve hearing skill, and this surgery is feasible; if tympanoplasty cannot be used to a wide range of middle ear cholesteatoma, canal wall down mastoidectomy should be preferred in order to avoid recurrence and affect the efficacy.

T1  - Hearing in patients with cholesteatoma: Facing reality
AB  - Learning Objectives: to confront the otologic community with the non-optimal hearing of individuals with controlled cholesteatoma. Introduction: Goals of management in cholesteatoma are to create a safe ear (avoiding complications), to achieve a dry and convenient ear and to reach the best possible hearing restoration. Although hearing restoration is not defined as the first priority for treatment in cholesteatoma, it may have serious long-term effects on patient's life. Method(s): The study included two study groups. In one group there were 260 consecutive cholesteatoma surgeries, 128 adults and 132 children . The mean group follow-up was 6.6 +/- 12.8 yrs. Hearing thresholds were analyzed according to type of surgery performed and age of the patients (children Vs adults). The other group includes 39 ears of children who were operated after the introduction of routine use of none EPI-diffusion weighted MRI and the complete avoidance of traditional radical cavities. In this group follow up was much shorter (Mean 1.4 +/- 1.3 yrs.) Results: Mean group air conduction (AC) PTA after canal wall up procedures were 38 dB in children and 55 dB in adults. Mean group AC-PTA after canal wall down procedures were 70 dB in children and 60 dB in adults. Group AC-PTA after canal wall up procedures were 38 dB in children and 55 dB in adults. In the group with radical mastoidectomy and reconstruction of the EEC and mastoid obliteration mean group AC-PTA was 40 dB as compared to 60 dB in the canal wall down cases which were left as radical cavities. Conclusion(s): The mean AC-PTA of ears with controlled cholesteatoma indicates that hearing is unsatisfactory in many of the individuals with controlled cholesteatoma. When it is evident that hearing is not within normal thresholds (whether ossiculoplasty was performed or not) all relevant rehabilitation options should be offered to the patients, including conventional hearing aids, bone conduction systems, middle ear implants or cochlear implants.

T1  - Indications and techniques in canal wall up mastoidectomy
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyse the functional and hearing outcomes of canal wall up mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma. Material(s) and Method(s): 252 patients who underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma were analysed. Charts were analysed for age of the patient, type of cholesteatoma, surgical procedures, hearing results, recurrence and follow up. Result(s): 64% of the patients belonged to the pediatric population. 38% of the patients had a follow-up of at least five years. Of the patients who underwent two staged surgery, 46.1% had a residual lesion that was identified and excised during the second surgery. Over a five year follow-up period, there were 12.5% patients with recurrences, all belonging to the group in whom a residual cholesteatoma was identified during the second staged surgery. The rate of residual cholesteatoma tended to decrease as age increases. The type of cholesteatoma, acquired or congenital middle ear, were not statistically related to the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Hearing analysis showed that hearing recovery was excellent with canal wall up procedures and remained stable over five years. Conclusion(s): Surgery for cholesteatoma is especially challenging in a pediatric population because of the need for hearing preservation. Hence canal wall up mastoidectomy in a single or two stages should be the approach of choice in the pediatric population. Radiological follow-up by DWI is mandatory for more than 5 years as recurrences can be seen even after 5 years.

T1  - Cholesteatoma treated by mastoid obliteration, recommendations from a personal follow-up of surgical results
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: Despite declining prevalence, cholesteatoma remains the most devastating type of chronic otitis media that can affect hearing, balance and facial nerve function. In order to prevent such complications, cholesteatoma requires surgical removal. This study presents the lessons learned from an overview of personal results of a single otologic surgeon after starting in a staff position. Method(s): 183 patients that were operated for cholesteatoma between September 2009 and November 2015 by a single otologist were included in this retrospective evaluation. All patients underwent surgery for cholesteatoma and were followed-up by either MRI DWI (>95%) or a mandatory second look procedure (<5%). In general, a canal wall-up technique with ossicular chain reconstruction was used and in selected cases this was followed by mastoid obliteration with bone dust. Result(s): Personal results will be presented on recurrent and residual disease after cholesteatoma surgery. A significant otologic learning curve was seen after evaluation of all cases and this was entirely related to a significant reduction of the percentage recurrent and not residual cholesteatoma. Additional mastoid obliteration leads to a significant reduction of recurrent but not residual disease. No difference was seen in results between pediatric and adult patients. Conclusion(s): A strict personal follow-up of surgical results on cholesteatoma surgery identified mastoid obliteration as a key factor to reduce recurrent cholesteatoma.

T1  - Endoscopic management of cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Endoscope is widely accepted instrument for minimally invasive surgical approach for many clinical field. The main benefits of endoscopic management for cholesteatoma surgery are preserving the normal anatomical structure with complete removal of disease in the complicated middle ear structure. There are two aspects of endoscopic cholesteatoma surgery: totally transcanal endoscopic surgery vs. endoscope as an adjuvant instrument. Though totally transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) can provide wide surgical view without destruction of normal anatomical structures, it has disadvantage of one hand surgery with two instrument in relatively narrow ear canal. Surgical time for the TEES is longer than in microscopic surgery, especially for the beginners. We use the endoscope for every cholesteatoma surgery as an adjuvant instrument for microscopic surgery. With combined approach from both transcanal and transmastoid approach, we use the endoscope of 45 and 70 degree for inspection of blind spot in the middle ear cavity, and remove the remnant or residual cholesteatoma with intact canal wall. The chances of canal wall down approach were reduced dramatically with this methods. This technique is very useful especially for adhesive middle ear disease, attic cholesteatoma and congenital cholesteatoma. We will present the cases of adhesive middle ear disease, attic and congenital choesteatoma with this endoscope as an adjuvant for microscopic surgery.

T1  - Postoperative residual cases in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: Acquired cholesteatoma is more aggressive in children than in adults. Despite the aggressive behaviour, radical treatment such as canal wall down technique was less performed to reduce cavity problem which requires endless care. This results in high rate of residues and recurrence. We focused in this study on reducing residues in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma surgery and explored risk factors of residual lesions. Method(s): Medical charts of 39 children under 15 years old with acquired cholesteatoma were retrospectively reviewed. Various factors were compared between the residual cholesteatoma ( + ) and (-) groups: surgical procedures, type of cholesteatoma, number of primary sites of cholesteatoma at surgery (P, protympanum; T, tympanic cavity; A, attic; M, mastoid), development of mastoid air cells, and the status of stapes. Residue ( + ) was defined if residual lesion was found after one-stage surgery or planned two-stage surgery, but not during second-look operation. Result(s): Residual cholesteatoma was found ten out of 39 ears (25.6%). Residual sites including overlaps were mastoid cavity (n = 7) followed by tympanic cavity (n = 6) and attic (n = 4), which is different from adult acquired cholesteatoma where the tympanic cavity such as tympanic sinus is the most likely area of residues. Among the various factors examined, significant differences were found between the residue (+) and (-) groups: multiple primary sites such as TAM and PTAM diseases and poor status of stapes were more seen in residue (+) group. Conclusion(s): Residual cholesteatoma was mostly seen in mastoid cavity, probably because small piece of epithelium remains in honeycomb structure of well-developing mastoid cavity, which is a characteristic feature of mastoid in children. In order to minimize the residual lesion, surgeons should take care of complete removal of mastoid cholesteatoma especially in patients with advanced case such as multiple primary sites and with invasion to stapes.

T1  - Endoscopic exclusive transcanal approach to the tympanic cavity cholesteatoma in pediatric patients: Our experience
AB  - Learning Objectives: The aim of the present study is to describe our experience in the management of tympanic cavity cholesteatoma in pediatric patients, treated with endoscopic exclusive transcanal approach. Objective(s): Describe our experience in the management of tympanic cavity cholesteatoma in pediatric patients treated with endoscopic exclusive transcanal approach. Method(s): Review of surgical cases performed between January 2007 and December 2013. Patients presenting with cholesteatoma of the tympanic cavity with no mastoid involvement were included in the first group and underwent an exclusive transcanalar endoscopic approach (TEA). Patients with mastoid extension of the pathology were included in the control group and underwent a canal wall up microscopic technique (CWU). Result(s): 59 ears of 54 patients were reviewed. Median age was 9.6 years (range 4-16 years). 31 cholesteatomas underwent a TEA approach, while 28 underwent a CWU approach, based on inclusion criteria. No differences from congenital vs acquired form was made. The ossicular chain was preserved in 26.6% of patients (16 ears): 42% of patients (13 ears) undergoing a TEA and 10% of patients undergoing a CWU approach (3 ears) (P = 0.006). Second look surgery was executed in 41.6% of patients (25 ears). In partial ossicular prosthesis reconstructions, the mean preoperative pure-tone average (PTA) was 29.4 dB, while the mean postoperative PTA was 27.1 dB, with a mean increase of 2.3 dB. In total ossicular prosthesis reconstructions, the mean preoperative PTA was 47.8 dB, while the mean postoperative PTA was 26.5 dB, with a mean increase of 21.3 dB. Recurrence rate was 12.9% (4 ears) for the TEA group and 17.2% (5 ears) for the CWU approach. Residual disease was present in 26.6%: 19.3% (6 ears) for the TEA and 34.4% (10 ears) for the CWU approach. The mean follow up was 36 months (range 8-88). Kaplan-Meier analysis at 36 months showed a lower recurrence risk for the TEA compared with the CWU approach, but this data was not statistically significant (P = 0.58). Conclusion(s): TEA represents a feasible, minimally invasive and conservative technique for the management of pediatric middle ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - Primary obliteration of the mastoid cavity in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - Learning Objectives: Handling of Canal wall up and Canal wall down mastoidal cavities in cholesteatoma surgery. Danish Otology Society symposium Mastoidectomy is often necessary in cholesteatoma surgery. If the posterior ear canal wall can be preserved, the mastoidal cavity remains in contact with the middle ear air space, even though it is often filled with scar tissue. The pressure-regulating role of the mastoid mucosa is presumably destroyed or severely diminished due to removal of the trabecular structure. Should the canal wall-up cavity be obliterated in order to prevent recurrence of a cholesteatoma? Or should it be left open allowing subsequent re-aeration? The latter includes a risk of renewed negative pressure in the middle ear and mastoid and the development of recurrent cholesteatoma. If the posterior ear canal wall has to be removed producing a modified radical cavity, the ear canal is substantially enlarged. This implies regular cleaning (often by an ENT specialist), and moist and infections in the cavity can be troublesome. Should the cavity be obliterated in order to restore the ear canal to its normal size? Or should it be left open for optimal disease control? We have developed a strategy with partial obliteration and enlargement of the ear canal opening. Bone dust, cartilage, fascia and on rare occasions artificial material can be used for obliteration. We find that a partial obliteration diminishes the need for postoperative ear care.

T1  - Rationale for obliteration of the mastoid cavity
AB  - Learning Objectives: Basic knowledge about the anatomy and function of the mastoid provides a rationale for obliteration of the cavity in cholesteatoma surgery. "Danish Otology Society symposium" Mastoidectomy is often included in cholesteatoma surgery in order to eradicate the disease. In such cases the subsequent reconstruction of the middle ear may include obliteration of the mastoid. This has become increasingly popular, because studies have demonstrated less recurrent cholesteatomas. While this may speak for itself, the basic reasons for obliteration have not been documented. The rationale for mastoid obliteration should be based on its function in normal and diseased ears, but our understanding of the mastoid function is rather limited despite its unique structure compared with the tympanum. Thus, the mastoid has been regarded to have only a passive role, where it may enhance the area for gas exchange as well as be a pressure buffer by virtue of its volume. Recent clinical physiological experiments have demonstrated how pressure regulation of the middle ear cleft consists of both stepwise pressure changes by Eustachian tube openings as well as gradual pressure changes explained by changes in the thickness or congestion of the mastoid mucosa. More studies have confirmed this idea, which may point to a role of the mastoid in the overall pressure regulation. The histological structure of the mastoid mucosa favors such a function by a loose connective tissue and abundant blood vessels. However, the mucosa does not display cilia and goblet cells as found in the tympanum, which makes it more susceptible to inflammatory changes. Chronic or recurrent infections may easily cause a relative fibrosis, which inevitably limits its capability for thickness changes based on its congestion, whereas its capability for gas absorption may remain unaffected. In this scenario, the mastoid mucosa may have lost its functional properties because of chronic or recurrent inflammations, and obliteration can eliminate the contribution of a diseased mucosa, which may contribute only to gas absorption and development of middle ear underpressure.

T1  - How to perform a good canal wall up mastoidectomy
AB  - Learning Objectives: How to perform a good canal wall up mastoidectomy. Various techniques for cholesteatoma surgery have been developed, practiced, criticized, and favored by different otologists. The current dilemma regarding the choice of technique reflects differences of option between various schools of thinking in Otology. However, both the open and closed techniques have now been individualized, and the choice of procedure can be made in accordance with certain indications in order to optimize the results. In the 1960s Bill House popularized Canal Wall Up (CWU) mastoidectomies; since then CWU mastoidectomy has remained the ideal surgical treatment for pediatric cholesteatoma. This technique allows preservation of the hearing function without aestetic modification of the external ear. The limit of this technique is the incresed risk of cholesteatoma recurrence or residual; for this reason, a two-stages procedure is preferred. Indications for CWU mastoidectomy are cholesteatoma in pneumatized mastoids, children, limited epitympanic erosion, mesotympanic cholesteatoma, limited congenital cholesteatoma. Contraindications are a widespread disease, bony distruction and poor hearing. The aim of our presentation is to show technical refinements of this technique, focusing on surgical cases and results in pediatric population.

T1  - Incidence of mastoidectomy among cholesteatoma patients in Denmark
AB  - Objective: 1) To describe the incidence rate of first-time surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma (STMEC1) in Denmark 1977-2015 and to estimate the proportion undergoing mastoidectomy. 2) To describe the recurrence rate after STMEC1 on Funen 1982-2015 taking surgical approach into consideration. Method(s): Cases of STMEC1 were identified by the use of the Danish National Hospital Register which also provided data on mastoidectomy. A change in incidence rate over time was examined using Poisson regression analysis. For STMEC1s on Funen, the medical records were reviewed. The rate of recurrence was analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method and Cox regression analysis. Result(s): A total of 16,475 STMEC1s were identified. Of these 4,416 (27%) were children (<16 years of age) and 12,059 (73%) were adults. The incidence rate of STEM1 in adults was stable at 6-7 per 100,000 person years for the last couple of decades. In children the incidence rate fell from 15 per 100,000 person years in 2002 to 7 per 100,000 person years in 2015. The proportion undergoing mastoidectomy was stable (53% in children and 58% in adults). The medical records from 1,003 patients with cholesteatoma (1,056 ears) were reviewed. The overall proportion of ears with recurrence was 38% in children and 14% in adults 5 years after primary surgery. Individuals without the need of mastoidectomy were at lowest risk of recurrence while individuals undergoing canal wall up (CWU) without obliteration had the highest risk of recurrence (58% in children and 20% in adults after 5 years). In children, CWU without obliteration was associated with a hazard ratio for recurrence of 1.9 (95% 1.2-3.0) when compared with CWU with obliteration. Conclusion(s): The incidence rate of STMEC1 in children halved from 2002 to 2015. Compared with adults, children were at an increased risk of recurrence. In children treated with CWU, obliteration was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence compared with no obliteration.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: Criteria for the selection of the surgical technique
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: The surgical technique in cholesteatoma is decided on the bases of the following criteria: 1.-Anatomical characteristics of the mastoid. 2.-Clinical type of cholesteatoma: Congenital. Primary acquired. Secondary acquired. 3.-Surgical type of cholesteatoma: Encapsulated and non-encapsulated. 4.-The estate of the mucose membrane. Absent, cholesterol granuloma, polyps in the middle ear, etc.. 5.-Extension of the cholesteatoma. Material(s) and Method(s): The above described criteria is revised in 380 consecutively operated. The different techniques and their results are described. At present the most frequent technique is Intact Canal Wall tympanoplasty (210 ICW, 60%) followed by different types of Canal Wall Down (140 CWD 40%) tympanoplasties. In 350 (92%) a tympanoplasty was performed. The incidence of Radical Mastoidectomies (RM), middle ear exclusion (MEE) and Subtotal petrosectomies (STP) are very infrequent (8%) and are performed mostly in revision surgery in cases with a failure of CWD tympanoplasty. Result(s): The failures are subdivided in recurrent and residual cholesteatoma: We have five percent of recurrent cholesteatoma in the adult and eight percent in children. In 20% of the cases there is a residual cholesteatoma. Only 2% of them in CWD tympanoplasty, RM, MEE or STP. The hearing results can be summarized saying that in 60% of the patients there is useful hearing without the need for a hearing aid. These results are closely related to the technique used for surgery. Conclusion(s): Adequate selection of the surgical technique for each individual case is the first goal to obtain best results both to minimize recurrences and to obtain the best possible hearing results. There is not a surgical technique that is best for all cases. Diffusion MRI is very useful to follow cases of MEE and STP and has made us to indicate these techniques more often.

T1  - Middle ear aeration in staged canal wall up tympanoplasty combined with mastoid cortex plasty or bony mastoid obliteration
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: If poor postoperative aeration can be accurately predicted, canal wall down tympanoplasty or obliteration technique is preferable to canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT) is described, however, little is known about the dynamics of middle ear aeration. We sought to determine how the aeration levels changed during the first-and second-stage operations (1stSOP and 2ndSOP), and the most recent CT examinations (recent CT). Method(s): Our study was included 50 ears which had a cholesteatoma extending into the antrum or mastoid cavity involving the ossicular chain with varying degrees of scutum defect. Middle ear aeration was assessed during 1stSOP and 2ndSOP, and recent CTwhichwas performed at least 5 years subsequent to the 2ndSOP. Middle ear aeration was graded using the following scale: 0, no aeration in themiddle ear; 1, only the mesotympanum is aerated; 2, the entire tympanic cavity, including the attic, is aerated; and 3, the tympanic and mastoid cavities are aerated. The staged CWUT with mastoid cortex plasty was selected for 23 ears with grade 3 aeration (well-aerated ears group) during 2ndSOP, the staged CWUT with bony mastoid obliteration for 27 ears with grade 0~2 aeration (poorly-aerated ears group). Result(s): Aeration between 1stSOP and 2ndSOP was improved in 70% of all. Then, by mastoid cortex plasty, 91% of grade 3 ears during 2ndSOP maintained that level up to recent CT. By bony mastoid obliteration, 69% of grade 2 ears and 90% of grade 1 ears maintained their aerations. A deep pocket formation occurred in 0% of grade 3 and 2 ears, 20% of grade 1 ears and 33% of grade 0 ears. There was no significant group difference in aeration level during 1stSOP, and the proportion of the two groups during 2ndSOPwas 48%vs. 47%. Conclusion(s): Staging is instructive for understanding longterm changes in aeration status. The selection of mastoid cortex plasty or bony mastoid obliteration is suitable and reliable for stabilizing postoperative aeration levels.

T1  - Incidence, recurrence rate and prognostic factors for cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Purpose: The purpose of this study was to calculate long term recurrence rates of cholesteatoma and to identify significant indendepedent prognostic factors for the recurrence. Material(s) and Method(s): 147 children and adults operated for debuting cholesteatoma, primarily by CWU (canal wall up) mastoidectomy, at Aarhus University Hospital in the period 2001-2005 were included. Five-and ten-year Kaplan-Meier cumulative recurrence rates were calculated and significant prognostic factors were identified by Cox multivariate regression analyses. One year pre to post-operative hearing outcomes were assessed. Result(s): Five and ten year recidivism rates (with confidence intervals) were 0.38 (0.31-0.46) and 0.44 (0.37-0.53) respectively. The same estimates from purely CWU with single-stage ossiculoplasties were 0.39 (0.3-0.51) and 0.49 (0.39-0.60) respectively. Independent significant prognosticfactors were: Age below 15 years, extension of cholesteatoma into the mastoid, erosion of the incus, and erosion of the stapes. Overall, there was a significant pre-to post-operative air-bone gap (ABG) improvement of 4.05 dB (1.0-7.1). Conclusion(s): Long termrecurrence rates and prognostic factors of CWU mastoidectomy help decision making in surgical approach and risk stratification of patients. Especially children with large choleateomas extending into the mastoid and with concomitant bone erosions should be carefully followed up.

T1  - The results of obliteration technique in canal wall up and wall down tympanomastoidectomy in patients with acquired middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: The objective in the surgical management of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is eradication of disease and the creation of a dry, safe ear. For reducing of incidence of frequent cleaning need after CWD, as well as for control of reretraction of tympanic membrane after CWU tympanomastoidectomy, mastoid obliteration is preferable for many otological surgeons. Material(s) and Method(s): 50 patients (16 to 65 y.o.) with cholesteatoma have been observed in this work. 34 ears have extensive cholesteatoma with erosion of posterior bony wall of ear canal. In 12 patients cholesteatoma involves only epitympanum, in 4-hole tympanic cavity. Posterior canal wall erosion due to cholesteatoma was indentified as the primary indication for radical mastoidectomy. Most patients mentioned periodic, only 7 of them-persistent otorrhea. All patients had conductive to mixed hearing loss with ABG more than 25 dB. 34 patients were undergone CWD, 16 CWU tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration using of bone pate' from the cortical layer of mastoid. Temporalis fascia has been used for tympanic membrane grafting and for covering of mastoid cavity filling with bone pate'. Tragal cartilage has been used in 27 patients for placement between the head of the stapes and fascia. In cases of cholesteatoma in the oval window area, ossiculoplasty is postponed for second look surgery. Result(s): Among the 50 patients 42(84%) grafts healed. In 5(10%) patients cholesteatoma developed during 3 years after the surgery. In 3(6%) patients reperforation occurred without cholesteatoma. Conclusion(s): The mastoidectomy with tympanic membrane grafting and mastoid obliteration provides eradication of disease, prevents reretraction of tympanic membrane in patients with middle ear cholesteatoma. The results of surgery are good basis for the second stage-ossiculoplasty with hearing improvement.

T1  - Long term functional and hearing outcomes of surgery in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the functional and hearing outcomes of surgery for cholesteatoma in pediatric population. Study Design: Retrospective study Setting: Gruppo Otologico, a quarternary referral center for Otology and Skull Base Surgery in Italy. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis is presented of 664 cases of cholesteatoma in pediatric population who were treated by surgery. The surgical approach was chosen according to the hearing loss, symptoms, status of tympanic membrane and radiological finding. Surgical procedures included Canal Wall Down mastoidectomies, Modified Bondy mastoidectomies, Canal Wall Up mastoidectomies, Radical mastoidectomies, revision surgeries and Subtotal Petrosectomies. In some of these patients additional procedure included Cochlear Implants or Boneanchored hearing aids. Charts were analysed for type of cholesteatoma, surgical procedures, hearing results, recurrence and follow up. Result(s): Charts of 664 patients were analysed. Of these patients, 39% underwent CWD surgery, 38% CWU surgery, 4.9% CWD with Bondy's technique, 4.3% radical CWD, 0.75% subtotal petrosectomy and 13% of patients underwent a revision tympanoplasty. For long-term functional and hearing outcomes, 552 patients with a follow-up of > 1 year were analyzed separately. Our experience shows an incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma of 19% during 10 years of follow up. In most of these cases CWU procedure was converted into a CWD mastoidectomy. Hearing results will be discussed upon presentation. Conclusion(s): Surgery for cholesteatoma is especially challenging in a pediatric population because of the need for hearing preservation. Hence canal wall up mastoidectomy in a single or two stages should be the approach of choice in the pediatric population. The modified Bondy technique is a very useful hearing preservation procedure in limited epitympanic cholesteatomas. Radiological follow-up by DWI is mandatory in children for more than 5 years as recurrences can be seen even after 5 years.

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma behaviour and the role of bony obliteration in its treatment
AB  - Learning Objectives: Characteristics of pediatric cholesteatoma Our experience in using a bony obliteration tympanoplasty technique is discussed. Mastoid obliteration in cholesteatoma surgery symposium, Dutch-Belgian Otology Group. Pediatric cholesteatoma is a different identity to its adult counterpart. It is more frequently infectious, aggressive, more proliferative and associated with less favorable prognosis. An overview on characteristics and epidemiology of pediatric cholesteatoma is given. Preliminary results on >100 children operated in the Sophia Children's hospital from January 2014 using predominantly a canal wall up approach with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space are shown.

T1  - Managment of pediatric cholesteatoma: The gruppo otologico experience in the management of 618 cases
AB  - Learning Objectives: Management of pediatric cholesteatoma and the long term outcomes of canal wall up mastoidectomy. The objectiveof this study is to report the Gruppo Otologico experience in the surgical treatment of paediatric cholesteatoma. This is a retrospective study wherein 572 charts of young patients who underwent surgery between 1983 and 2015 were analysed. 46 patients had bilateral disease and the average age was 10.6 years old. The extension of cholesteatoma was defined using Sanna and Zini's cholesteatoma classification. The most commonly surgical procedure used in children were Canal Wall Up and a Canal Wall Down tympanoplasty. Canal Wall Up Tympanoplasty (CWU) was performed in 263 patients, while, Canal Wall Down Tympanoplasty (CWD) that includes Modified Bondy Technique (BT) and Radical Mastoidectomy (RM), was used in 258 patients. Thereweremore numbers of revision surgeries in CWU (34%) than CWD (10%) tympanoplasty. In all surgeries put together, we had an improvement of hearing of a mean of 8.5 dB HL. Themean follow-up was 10 years. In conclusion, the technique of choice for pediatric cholesteatoma is CWU tympanoplasty. However, the use of a CWD approach to surgically treat extensive cholesteatoma in children results in a low recurrence rate with a high rate of trouble-free ear in the long term.

T1  - The role of periosteum in mastoid surgery
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the importance of the integrity and pattern of the periosteal lining of the mastoid cavity in the outcome and sequel of the different types of the mastoid surgeries. Method(s): Revision mastoid surgeries (122 cases) of different kinds (both canal wall-up and canal wall-down mastoidectomies) between the years 2010 and 2015 were included. Intraoperative multiple curettages from the unhealthy-looking bone in direct relation to pathologic findings as granulations, polypi, and cholesteatoma were collected and histopathologically studied to determine the nature of the bony tissue and the status of the periosteum. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans for both revision and primary surgery for every case were evaluated whenever possible. Result(s): In all cases, periosteal problems could be detected. Periosteal layer deficiency in 1 or more areas of the mastoid cavity was present in almost all cases, and it was always replaced by granulation tissue or unhealthy bony tissue. Periostitis was suspected in 23 cases (18%), whereas osteitis of different levels of severities was suspected in 69 cases (57%). Sclerotic and diploic cellularity types of mastoid were mostly affected. In addition, when the primary surgery was performed in cellular mastoid, these pathologic findings were very minimal. Conclusion(s): Healthy integral periosteal lining of the mastoid cavity seems to be an essential factor for the cavity stability and surgery outcome. Detailed understanding of the mastoid cavity development, anatomy, and histology together with the studying of the preoperative CT scans helps in preserving the integrity of the cavity periosteum during surgery.

T1  - Chronic inflammatory middle ear disease: Postoperative CT and MRI findings
AB  - Aim To prospectively evaluate the value of CT and MRI in diagnosis of middle ear pathologies following operation for chronic otitis media (COM). Patients and methods Fifty patients, who had been operated on for chronic middle ear disease, were referred for either CT alone or followed by MRI depending on the different case scenarios. Imaging findings were correlated with surgical findings. Results CT alone was done in 10 patients; 6/10 showed a free mastoidectomy cavity and 4/10 showed a clear cavity with abnormal position of the prosthesis. The rest of the 40 patients did a CT followed by MRI which showed granulation tissue in 17 patients, cholesteatoma in 13/14 patients of which one showed intracranial extension, combined granulation tissue with cholesteatoma in 5/6 patients, cholesterol granuloma in 2 patients and meningocele in another 2 patients. Overall CT sensitivity and specificity was 46.25% and 90.77% and MRI sensitivity and specificity was 95.23% and 99.16% respectively. Conclusion CT and MRI are both safe non-invasive diagnostic methods. Both procedures can provide radiologists a confident diagnosis of postoperative middle ear complications, assisting otologists with a provisional diagnosis for a better management.Copyright Â© 2015 The Authors.

T1  - Which technique is better for cholesteatoma surgery?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical outcomes and recurrence rates of three surgical techniques that are commonly used for cholesteatoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hospital records of 132 patients with primary cholesteatoma who underwent surgery between January 1996 and December 2006 were evaluated retrospectively. Twelve cases had bilateral disease, and a total of 144 ears were treated. The patients were divided into three groups according to surgical technique: modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) (n = 48 ears), radical mastoidectomy (RM) (n = 42 ears), and intact canal wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) (n = 54 ears). MRM and RM procedures are canal wall down (CWD) techniques, whereas the ICWM procedure is a canal wall up (CWU) technique. Postoperatively, all patients were followed up yearly for at least 6 years. The otomicroscopic features, cholesteatoma extension, surgical findings, and recurrence rates were compared in the groups. RESULTS: Preoperative otomicroscopic examination showed attic retraction or perforation in 32% of the cases and central perforation in 11%. There was a higher cholesteatoma recurrence rate in the ICWM group than in the MRM and RM groups (p < 0.05), but there was also better hearing gain in the ICWM group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There are several surgical techniques for eradicating cholesteatoma. Our study found that CWD procedures (RM, MRM) were more effective for the eradication of cholesteatoma, but hearing gain was better when a CWU technique was used. The choice of surgical technique should be individually tailored based on the pre-operative imaging and hearing examination findings.

T1  - Chronic otitis media
AB  - Chronic otitis media (COM) is a common problem facing general practitioners, pediatricians and otolaryngologists. This article reviews the aetiopathogenesis, epidemiology, presentation, natural history, complications and management of COM. The literature was reviewed by using the PubMed search engine and entering a combination of terms including "COM", "diagnosis", "incidence", "complications" and "management". Relevant articles were identified and examined for content. What is the "take-home" message for the clinician? COM is a common problem with various sub-categories according to the disease state. It most commonly presents with painless otorrhoea and hearing loss. Treatment options vary according to the activity and type of disease encountered. COM carries significant patient morbidity.Copyright Â© 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.

T1  - Synchronous ossiculoplasty with ossicular replacement prosthesis during canal wall down mastoidectomy for advanced cholesteatoma: Anatomical and audiological outcomes
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the anatomical and audiological outcomes of synchronous ossiculoplasty with ossicular replacement prosthesis during canal wall down mastoidectomy for advanced cholesteatoma. Method(s): The prospective study was done at a tertiary referral institute included 30 patients of cholesteatoma who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy. Ossicular reconstruction was performed using polytetraluoroethylene (PTFE) (telo) partial or total ossicular replacement prosthesis. Patientw ere assessed at 1st, 3rd and 6th postoperative months for graft uptake and hearing evaluation using pure tone audiometry (PTA) in which air bone gap (ABG) closure and mean ABG was calculated and compared with the mean preoperative ABG. Result(s): The mean ABG [both total occicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) and partial occicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) groups combined] considerably reduced from 34.33 +/- 4.10 dB preoperatively to 15.47 +/- 7.65 dB postoperatively at 6 months. There was a 46.29% of closure of ABG in 1st month, which closed more (53.89%) in 3rd month and even more (55.34%) in 6th postoperative month. p < 0.001 showed the ABG closure ratio and reduction in the mean ABG was statistically signiicant in the postoperative period. Conclusion(s): Ossicular reconstruction with ossicular replacement prosthesis offers good functional results when performed during canal wall down surgery for advanced cholesteatoma, as a single-stage procedure.Copyright Â© 2015, Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd.

T1  - The Role of Obliteration in the Achievement of a Dry Mastoid Bowl
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of mastoid obliteration on the achievement of a dry mastoid bowl and frequency of maintenance care. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Academic medical center. PATIENTS: There were 63 canal-wall-down mastoidectomies for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma between 2007 and 2014 with follow-up of at least 6 months. Eighteen mastoids were nonobliterated and 45 were obliterated. Thirteen underwent secondary obliteration of existing mastoid bowls with chronic drainage, whereas 32 underwent primary obliteration at the original canal-wall-down procedure. INTERVENTION: Mastoid obliteration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Achievement of a dry healed mastoid cavity and frequency of outpatient visits. RESULTS: In more than 80% of the cases, a dry ear was achieved, with no significant difference between the obliterated and nonobliterated cases (p = 0.786). Eleven of the 13 secondary cases experienced cessation of otorrhea, achieving dry ears at rates similar to that of the primary and nonobliterated cases. The secondary obliteration population was also significantly younger than the primary group (22.1 versus 43.5 years, p = 0.002). Multivariable-mixed effects analysis demonstrated a reduction in 0.1 visits per 6-month period following surgery overtime (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid obliteration may be valuable in the management of the well-developed and chronically wet mastoid cavity, particularly when the drainage emanates from mucosal disease or cell tracts in a deep sinodural angle. Younger patients may require secondary obliteration because of continued craniofacial maturation several years following canal-wall-down surgery.

T1  - Long term safety and hygienic results of the bony obliteration tympanoplasty in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Introduction and aim The long-term safety of the ear (no recurrence and/or residual disease) is the primary concern in cholesteatoma surgery, especially in the pediatric population. In this series we describe our experience with the canal wall up bony obliteration technique (CWU-BOT) in pediatric cholesteatoma cases. The objective of this study was to confirm that this is a safe and effective technique in children to lower the recurrence rate and to obtain good hygienic results. Material and methods Retrospective analysis of a consecutive series of 34 ears in 33 children (< 18 years) with acquired cholesteatoma (primary or recurrent) treated with a one-stage CWU-BOT in a tertiary referral centre during the period 1998-2009. Results All children had a follow-up period of 5 years. Ninety-four percent (n=32) of the patients were followed up by MRI including non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (non-EPI DWI) sequence at 1 and 5 years after surgery. At 5-year follow-up, 32 ears (94.2%) were free of residual disease, 33 ears (97.1%) remained without recurrent disease and. Conclusions Our results indicate that the CWU-BOT technique in children with acquired cholesteatoma is: a safe procedure concerning residual cholesteatoma, an effective technique to lower the long-term recurrence rate and to obtain good hygienic results.

T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy outcomes for congenital aural stenosis
AB  - Objectives: Determine whether a canal wall down mastoidectomy provides long-term improvement for children with aural stenosis. Method(s): Study design: Retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing mastoidectomy procedures. Year(s) conducted: 1. Disease/condition studied: Aural stenosis. Subjects studied: Children 18 years or younger. Setting(s): Tertiary level children's hospital. Intervention(s): Canal wall down mastoidectomy. Outcome measurement(s)/independent variables: Retrospective review of children having undergone a canal wall down mastoidectomy by a single surgeon over an 11-year period. Preliminary analyses: Data from 10 children who underwent 15 canal wall down mastoidectomies for aural stenosis were reviewed, and their overall experiences were evaluated. Result(s): Additional indications included access for treatment of chronic serous otitis media (n = 4 cases), medically resistant otorrhea (n = 4), persistent tympanic membrane perforation (n = 2), cholesteatoma (n = 2), and failed canaloplasty procedure (n = 1). Average age at the time of surgery was 7.1 +/- 3 years. All cases resulted in improvement of the aural stenosis. There were no instances of facial nerve injury or serious complication. All cases of chronic serous otitis media resolved. Otorrhea resolved in 2 cases and improved in the other 2. One tympanic membrane perforation recurred 2 years after surgery; the other was successfully repaired. Both cholesteatoma cases resulted in long-term resolution of disease (52 and 114 months). Average change in speech reception threshold was 2.1 +/- 3.9 dB following surgery. Average followup was 4.9 +/- 2.9 years. Conclusion(s): Children with congenital aural stenosis with or without chronic otitis media, tympanic membrane perforation, or cholesteatoma may benefit from a canal wall down mastoidectomy.

T1  - Long-term outcome of ossiculoplasty using autogenous mastoid cortical bone
AB  - Objective: To observe the long-term outcome of ossiculoplasty using autogenous mastoid cortical bone in chronic otitis media in-patients. Method(s): Sixty-one ears of 57 in-patients with chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma, underwent type III tympanoplasty using autogenous mastoid cortical bone as the prosthetic material. Twenty-one ears were treated by canal wall down mastoidectomy and 40 ears by canal wall up mastoidectomy. The follow-up period was 3 to 6 years (average 4.2 years). Pure tone averages for thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz were calculated using standard conventional audiometry. Result(s): The pre-operative mean air-bone gap of 31.6 dB, for all ears, was reduced to 20.3 dB post-operatively. For the 40 canal wall up ears, this value decreased from 30.8 dB to 19.9 dB, and for the 21 canal wall down ears it decreased from 33.0 dB to 21.0 dB. The differences between the pre-and post-operative mean air-bone gap values were significant. Conclusion(s): No cases of extrusion, necrosis or resorption were exhibited for the autogenous mastoid cortical bone prosthesis. A significant hearing improvement was obtained in the majority of cases and this remained stable over time.Copyright Â© 2014 JLO (1984) Limited.

T1  - Preparation and placement of cartilage island graft in tympanoplasty
AB  - Introduction: Cartilage graft tympanoplasty has a better success rate in the treatment of chronic otitis media if regularly prepared and placed. Objective(s): To prepare cartilage island material and evaluate its effect on the success rate of tympanoplasty. Method(s): The medical records of 87 patients (48 males and 39 females; mean age, 27.3 +/- 11.2 years; range, 14-43 years) with chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma who underwent intact canal-wall-up tympanoplasty and revision surgery between December of 2007 and October of 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia via a retroauricular approach. Result(s): The overall success rate of this technique was 93% in terms of perforation closure. No graft lateralization or displacement into the middle ear occurred. The overall average preoperative air bone gap was 37.27 +/- 12.35. dB, and the postoperative air bone gap was 27.58 +/- 9.84. dB. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 15.3 months (range: 7-21 months). Conclusion(s): If cartilage graft is properly prepared and placed, cartilage graft tympanoplasty appears to provide better success rates and hearing results.Copyright Â© 2014 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

T1  - Cartilage tympanoplasty: A reliable technique for smokers
AB  - The aim of this study was to report our experience with cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) in smokers and compare it with that of non-smokers using a retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center. Between September 2008 and September 2010, cartilage tympanoplasty was performed in 52 patients. Among them, 27 were active smokers and 25 former or non-smokers. The entire tympanic membrane was replaced with conchal cartilage, shaped either as a shield for cases with intact canal wall mastoidectomies, or crashed for cases with canal wall down procedures. The mean post-operative follow-up was 12 months (range 6-18 months). A complete pre- and postoperative audiologic evaluation was obtained in all patients. Graft take was successful in all patients. The overall average pre-operative and post-operative pure tone average air-bone gaps (PTA-ABG) was 52.2 dB +/- 17.7 dB and 35.4 dB +/- 17.9 dB, respectively, with an overall improvement of 16.8 dB (p < 0.001). A post-operative PTA-ABG of 25 dB or less was achieved in 39 (75%) patients (p < 0.001). In smokers, the hearing improvement was 17.6 dB (p < 0.001) with a PTA-ABG of 25 dB or less in 19 (70%). In non-smokers, the average hearing improvement was 16.8 dB (p < 0.0005) with a post-operative PTA-ABG of 25 dB or less in 19 (76%), (p < 0.001). The results showed that the CT technique is a very effective procedure for smokers. Excellent graft take and satisfactory hearing results can be accomplished regardless of smoking habits.

T1  - Effectiveness of MESNA on the success of cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - Importance It is important that chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma be treated successfully in patients to protect them from having repeated surgeries with related surgical co-morbidities and hearing loss. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of MESNA usage on the residual cholesteatoma rates of the patients who underwent surgery due to chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Design Retrospective single-institution study of a prospectively collected database. Setting Tertiary University Hospital. Participants Nine hundred and thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to chronic otitis media between September 2000 and March 2012 by the same surgeon. One hundred and forty-one cases out of 934 patients were selected who had cholesteatoma for the study. These randomly selected 141 cases were divided into two groups as follows: I. Forty-six cases were applied MESNA (Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) intraoperatively, and II. Ninety-five cases were not applied MESNA intraoperatively. The cases that were followed-up at least one year were included in this study. Intervention MESNA (Ureomitexan, MESNA, Baxter oncology, Germany) was diluted with saline (20% MESNA and 80% saline) that was applied, and then a waiting period of approximately 5 min followed to start to dissect cholesteatoma matrix. Main outcomes and measures Residual cholesteatoma rates between intraoperative MESNA, a disulfide bond breaking chemical agent, applied and MESNA non-applied cases in the postoperative follow-up period were compared for the success of the surgery. Results MESNA was used in 46 patients out of 141 cases intraoperatively. Twenty-four of these patients underwent CWD (canal wall down), and twenty-two patients underwent CWU (canal wall up) mastoidectomy. For the other 95 subjects, 56 patients with CWD and 39 with CWU mastoidectomy, MESNA was not applied. Residual cholesteatoma rates were found to be significantly higher in MESNA non-applied group than MESNA applied group (p < 0.05). Residual cholesteatoma rates between CWD and CWU mastoidectomy procedures were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions and relevance MESNA application that breaks disulfide bonds in the structure of the matrix in cholesteatoma surgery may assist the elimination of the disease, and increase surgical success by facilitating the elevation of the epithelium. Thereby, it causes a decrease in the possibility of remaining residual epithelium after surgery, which decreases the need for second-look surgery.

T1  - Comparison of visualization of the middle ear by microscope and endoscopes of 30degree and 45degree through posterior tympanotomy
AB  - Introduction: Endoscopic-assisted microsurgery of the middle ear enables the field of view of the surgeon to be expanded during the removal of inflammatory tissue from the tympanic cavity and during myringo- and ossiculoplasty. Canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy is a gold standard in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media. Most applications of endoscopy in middle ear surgery concern exclusively the endoscopic transcanal approach. Aim(s): To determine the usefulness of endoscopic visualization during the standard surgical approach through the posterior tympanotomy. Material(s) and Method(s): The study compared the visualization of the elements of the middle ear through the posterior tympanotomy by endoscopes with 30degree and 45degree optics and a microscope. Posterior tympanotomy was performed in eleven temporal bones. Visualization of the tympanic recesses was assessed on a subjective scale. A microscope and 30degree and 45degree endoscopes were used for inspection of the hypotympanum, sinus tympani, Eustachian tube, Prussak's space and footplate. Friedman ANOVA test and Dunn's multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis of the data. Result(s): Visualization of particular recesses by endoscopes, both 30degree and 45degree , was excellent, while the microscopic view was statistically significantly worse, especially for sinus tympani, Prussak's space and footplate. There were no significant differences in visibility of the middle ear spaces between the two types of endoscopic optics. Conclusion(s): Additional application of the endoscopes during middle ear surgery provides valuable information due to excellent visualization of key recesses usually hidden from the microscope.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma among Nigerians
AB  - The incidence of cholesteatoma among Nigerians is not well documented, as is the outcome of surgical treatment. A descriptive analysis of prospectively collected data of cases of cholesteatoma managed with tympanomastoidectomy at National Hospital Abuja between September 2005 and April 2012 is presented. Cases were analyzed for age, sex, type of cholesteatoma, intra-operative findings, and post-operative outcome after 6 months of follow up. A total of 28 ears from 25 cases of cholesteatoma had tympanomastoidectomy. Age range was 6-73 years (mean = 34.4, SD = 18.67). There were 13 females and 12 males. Primary acquired cholesteatoma was seen in 18 cases (20 ears), secondary acquired in 5 cases (six ears), and external auditory canal cholesteatoma was seen in 2 cases (two ears). The sites involved in middle ear cholesteatoma was attic, sinus and mesotympanum pars tensa (16/26), attic, sinus, antrum and mastoid cavity (5/26), attic, sinus, mesotympanum and mastoid antrum (4/26), and attic only (3/26).21/25 of cases (24 ears) managed had single stage intact canal wall (ICW) tympanomastoidectomy, while 4/25 (4 ears) had two-stage surgery with canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy in two of these, and revision surgery done within 12 months of first surgeries. 2/25 cases (in the two stage revision group) had postoperative persistent mastoid cutaneous fistula and were treated with post-auricular advancement flap. The commonest cholesteatoma type seen at National Hospital Abuja, Nigeria was primary acquired type, and involved the attic, sinus and mesotympanum pars tensa mainly, and most can be managed by single stage tympanomastoidectomy.

T1  - Epitympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration in the preservation of posterior canal wall: A technique for surgical treatment of attic cholesteatoma
AB  - To report and evaluate the surgical outcomes of the treatment of attic cholesteatoma using epitympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration in the preservation of the posterior canal wall. Our study group consists of 138 subjects with attic cholesteatoma who underwent surgery of the mastoidectomy of the intact posterior canal wall and epitympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration, from November 2008 to November 2010. The major techniques employed included the following: (1) mastoidectomy with the preservation of the posterior canal; (2) removal of the scutum; (3) epitympanum obliteration with cartilage, and (4) mastoid obliteration with bone dust. The post-operative observation period was between 2 and 4 years. All patients were examined via microscopy and oto-endoscopy. Of these 138 subjects, 91 subjects have a follow up period of more than 3 years. There was no retraction pocket formation in the epitympanum in all cases. However, in two subjects, there was a recurrence of cholesteatoma within the mesotympanum. Other observable post-surgery complications were also recorded. For hearing results, 64 of the 138 subjects underwent post-operative audiometric testing for 2 to 3 years and 3 to 4 years consecutively. The average pre- and post-operative air-bone gap closure was found to be 11.97 +/- 11.02 dB for the 2 to 3 year period, and 10.08 +/- 10.34 dB for the 3 to 4 year period. Based on the results of our study group, epitympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration in the preservation of the posterior canal wall is a better alternative treatment technique for attic cholesteatoma.

T1  - Chemically assisted dissection by means of mesna in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the use of mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate), a mucolytic agent capable of breaking disulfur bonds, reduces the frequency of residual cholesteatoma in canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care otology and skull base centers. PATIENTS: Two hundred fourteen patients operated on by means of canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy for a middle ear cholesteatoma. INTERVENTIONS: Planned staged canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy. In the study group, the cholesteatoma removal was performed with the support of chemically assisted dissection by using mesna. In the control group, the dissection of the disease was performed by means of a traditional mechanical technique alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of residual cholesteatoma at the second-stage operation in the 2 groups of study. RESULTS: One hundred eight patients were treated with the ancillary use of mesna and one hundred six without chemically assisted dissection. A residual cholesteatoma was found in 12 (11.1%) of the 108 patients treated with chemically assisted dissection and in 26 (24.5%) of the 106 patients treated with mechanical dissection. After adjusting for potential confounders, CADISS procedure was associated with a significantly lower risk of having residual cholesteatoma (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.84, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: This study showed that chemically assisted dissection by using mesna represents a valid support in reducing the frequency of residual disease in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Management of labyrinthine fistula in cholesteatoma otitis surgery
AB  - Introduction: Labyrinthine fistula constitutes a potentially severe complication of cholesteatoma otitis media, because of its consequences on cochleovestibular function and the association to other possible complications. Material(s) and Method(s): We report a retrospective study of approximately 14 cases of labyrinthine fistula operated at the ENT department of Tunis, Tunisia between 2008 and 2013. Result(s): We analyzed 14 cases (8 men and 6 women) of cholesteatoma otitis media complicated by a labyrinthine fistula. The fistula involved the lateral semicircular canal in all the cases. The patients were classified according to Dornhoffer and Milewski's classification, which is based on different stages in the bone defect. We included 10 cases of type II and 4 patients of type III. The bone defect of the labyrinth was detected in eight cases by the preoperative temporal bone computed tomography. Nine patients underwent a one-stage surgery by performing a canal wall down technique with the obliteration of the fistula by fascia and tissue glue. In five cases, a canal wall up technique was performed and the fistula was treated in the second stage surgery (second look). The long-term outcome was favorable in all the cases. Conclusion(s): Surgical management of labyrinthine fistula associated to cholesteatoma otitis media depends on the local conditions and the choice and preferences of the surgeon. A high resolution CT scan may diagnose these complications preoperatively.

T1  - Postoperative middle ear aeration and hearing results after canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction
AB  - Objectives: (1) Estimate the degree of postoperative aeration in the middle ear after canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction (CWD tympanoplasty with SWR) for cholesteatoma. (2) Characterize the relationship between postoperative middle ear aeration and hearing outcome. (3) Propose an ideal state of middle ear aeration in order to obtain satisfactory hearing outcome after CWD tympanoplasty with SWR. Method(s): This retrospective study was conducted in our tertiary referral hospital between 2001 and 2013. Seventy-eight ears with cholesteatoma treated surgically at our hospital by planned two-stage CWD tympanoplasty and SWR were included. Postoperative middle ear aeration was scored one year after second-stage surgery by computed tomography (CT). The patients were divided into 4 bins according to postoperative audiometric air-bone (A-B) gaps: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and >30 dB. Result(s): Postoperative middle ear aeration was significantly greater in the smaller A-B gap bins (0-10 and 11-20 dB) compared with the larger A-B gap bins (21-30 and >30 dB). In contrast to the larger A-B gap bins, those with smaller A-B gaps showed reaeration of the antrum and mastoid cavity. Conclusion(s): Promoting postoperative aeration of the entire middle ear is necessary to achieve better hearing outcome in patients undergoing CWD tympanoplasty with SWR for cholesteatoma. The ventilation tube insertion and placement of the large silicone sheet from the protympanum to the mastoid cavity in the first-stage tympanoplasty are candidate procedures to promote postoperative aeration.

T1  - The new technology: Canal wall up tympanoplasty with transplantation of tissue-engineered cell sheets
AB  - Objectives: The likelihood of recurrent retraction and adhesion of newly formed tympanic membrane is high when normal middle ear mucosa is extensively lost during intractable middle surgery. If rapid postoperative regeneration of the mucosa on the exposed bone surface can be achieved, prevention of recurrent tympanic membrane adhesion and cholesteatoma formation can be expected. The aim of this study was to develop a new method to transplant autologous cellsheets to promote postoperative regeneration of the middle ear mucosa. Method(s): We harvested 10-by-10-mm specimens of inferior turbinate mucosal tissue from the patient with acquired middle ear cholesteaoma. Tissue-engineered epithelial-cell sheets were fabricated ex vivo by culturing harvested cells for 3 weeks on temperature-responsive culture dishes in a cell-processing center (CPC) according to good manufacturing practice guidelines. After canal wall up tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy had been performed, sheets of cultured autologous cells that had been harvested with a simple reduced-temperature treatment were transplanted directly into the exposed bone surface of middle ear cavity from which normal mucosa had been absent. Result(s): During the cultivation, the sterile environment in the CPC was confirmed. Autologous cell sheets were successfully transplanted to human middle ear. Conclusion(s): This is the first clinical study approved from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. Furthermore this is a first-in-man study in the world in which cultured cells were transplanted to the human ear. This novel technology of transplantation might be an effective alternative to the surgical operation on intractable otitis media in the near future.

T1  - Long-term results of pediatric cholesteatoma surgery using canal-wall-down approach with primary obliteration: 5-year observational study
AB  - Objectives: Present the results of a 5-year longitudinal study in a pediatric population undergoing cholesteatoma surgery using a canal wall down approach with obliteration. Method(s): Prospective longitudinal study in a district general hospital from 1999 to 2013.46 children (<16 years) with cholesteatoma were included. Outcome measurements were: (1) residual, recurrence, and recidivist cholesteatoma rates at 5 years postsurgery; (2) postoperative hearing; (3) postoperative waterproofing of the ear; (4) number of subsequent ear surgeries required. Result(s): Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the residual cholesteatoma rate at 5-years post-surgery was 6.7% at a rate of 20.9 per 1000 years of child follow-up (95% confidence interval: 7.8- 55.6), representing 4 cases of residual cholesteatoma and no recurrences. No children experienced otorrhea at 5 years and the rate of definitive waterproofing was 94.8%. There was a reoperation rate of 18.3% (n = 11) at 5 years, which included planned ossiculoplasty. Regarding hearing, of the data available (n = 17), 12 children (70.6%) preserved maintained their hearing (change between -10 to =10 dB), 1 child (5.9%) had hearing gain (>10 dB), and 3 children (17.6%) had hearing reduction at 12 months postoperation. Six out of 17 children (35.3%) had a postoperative hearing level of <=30 dB. Conclusion(s): The use of a canal wall down approach with obliteration of the mastoid cavity to surgically treat cholesteatoma is safe in pediatric populations and results in a low recurrence rate and high rate of a trouble-free ear in the long term.

T1  - Middle ear reconstruction using the titanium Kurz Variac partial ossicular replacement prosthesis: Functional results
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Satisfactory functional results following ossicular chain reconstruction mainly depend on a stable connection between the tympanic membrane and the stapes, which is in turn dependent on the type of prosthesis used. Knowledge about the safety and functional outcome of the commercially available middle ear prostheses is therefore of great importance. OBJECTIVE(S): To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Kurz TTP-Variac System partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) in ossiculoplasty. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of all ossiculoplasties performed by 1 surgeon at a secondary referral center from August 2006 through July 2012. Participants were patients with cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media, or ossicular chain disruption in the absence of inflammatory disease who underwent ossicular reconstruction. EXPOSURE: Ossiculoplasty using a Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) and improvements in ABG were analyzed for each frequency by means of a 4-frequency pure-tone average. Successful postoperative hearing was defined as postoperative ABG smaller than 20 dB. RESULT(S): Eighty-nine ears in 83 patients aged 7 to 85 years were included. Transmeatal tympanoplasty was performed in 17 ears (19%). Seven ears (8%) underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall-down mastoidectomy, and 65 ears (73%) underwent canal wall-up (combined approach) tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. The study population comprised 61 primary tympanoplasties (69%) and 28 revision cases (31%). Mean follow-up was 13 months. Overall, the ABG significantly improved from a mean (SD; range) of 26.19 (11.53; 3.75-51.25) dB to 15.58 (9.80; 0-48.75) dB (P < .01 for all frequencies). Mean ABG improvement was 10.62 dB. Successful postoperative hearing was obtained in 65 ears (73%). Revision surgery, especially in ears with ossicular chain disruption without inflammatory disease, was associated with poorer functional outcome, whereas preservation of the malleus was associated with a better functional outcome (P < .05). There were few complications (1 prosthesis extrusion, 2 prosthesis dislocations, 2 reperforations, 3 cases of residual cholesteatoma, and 3 of light sensorineural hearing loss). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The titanium Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP is an effective prosthesis to reconstruct the ossicular chain. Complications are rare, illustrating the safety of the prosthesis.

T1  - Relationship between tympanic membrane retraction and habitual sniffing in patients with cholesteatoma
AB  - Conclusion: Habitual sniffing affects the pathogenicity and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Postoperative instructions requesting patients to cease sniffing may reduce the retraction and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Objective(s): To examine the relationship between tympanic membrane retraction and habitual sniffing in patients with cholesteatoma. Method(s): We recruited 98 patients (102 ears) who were surgically treated for cholesteatoma by canal wall-down tympanoplasty (22 ears) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty with reconstruction methods (80 ears). We classified these patients into two groups on the basis of their preoperative habitual sniffing: habitual and non-habitual sniffers. The findings of the contralateral tympanic membrane were examined in each group and were classified according to the Tos classifications. Next, we evaluated the incidence of 1-year postoperative tympanic membrane retraction treated by the canal-down tympanoplasty with reconstruction method in the following three groups: non-habitual sniffing group, sniffing cessation group, and continual sniffing group. Result(s): In habitual sniffers, the Tos classifications of contralateral tympanic membrane were normal in 7% (3/41). In contrast, for non-habitual sniffers, the findings were normal in 39% (21/54). These results indicate that sniffing causes tympanic membrane retraction. The tympanic membranes of patients in the sniffing cessation group were largely normal after surgery. However, more than 50% of the patients who continued to sniff after surgery showed retraction or recurrent cholesteatoma. Â© Informa Healthcare.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery in children: Long-term results of the inside-out technique
AB  - Objective: To present the anatomical and functional results of the inside-out technique applied in pediatric cholestetaoma surgery and to evaluate functionality with good hearing results against radicality with lower recurrence rate. Method(s): Retrospective analysis and evaluation of the postoperative outcome in a consecutive series of 126 children or 130 ears operated between 1992 and 2008. With the inside-out technique, cholesteatoma is eradicated from the epitympanum toward the mastoid and, as a single stage procedure, functional reconstruction of the middle ear is achieved by tympanoossiculoplasty. Result(s): In 89.2% of all cases, the ear was dry postoperatively. 80.9% of the ears reached a postoperative air-bone gap of 30. dB or less and the median air conduction hearing threshold was 29. dB; in 60.9% of all cases, hearing was postoperatively improved. The recurrence rate was 16.2% in a mean postoperative follow-up 8.5 years. Altogether, 48 ears (36.9%) underwent revision surgery. The complication rate was 3.1% and involved only minor complications. Conclusion(s): The inside-out technique allows a safe removal of cholesteatoma from the epitympanum toward the mastoid with a single-stage reconstruction of the ossicular chain. For this reason we support our individual approach, which allows creation of the smallest possible cavity for the size of the cholesteatoma. Our results confirm that the inside-out technique is effective in the treatment of pediatric cholesteatoma. Â© 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

T1  - The pros and cons of canal wall up versus canal wall down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - There has been fierce debate regarding the optimal surgical technique for the management of cholesteatoma for over 50 years. Choice of technique depends on factors relating to the surgeon, the patient and the disease process. Much literature has been devoted to the benefits and pitfalls of canal wall up and canal wall down techniques and their respective effects on measures such as number of operations required for disease eradication, adequate surgical access, complications, residual/recurrent cholesteatoma, hearing outcomes and long-term follow up. This article aims to review the pros and cons of canal wall up versus canal wall down surgery for cholesteatoma.Copyright Â© 2013 Rila Publications Ltd.

T1  - Intraoperative findings during Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy in chronic suppurative otitis media at a tertiary care hospital, Sukkur, Pakistan
AB  - Objective: To assess the intraoperative findings during canal wall down mastoidectomy in patients for unsafe type of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Methodology: This prospective interventional study was carried out at Department of ENT and Pediatrics of Ghulam Muhammad Mahar Medical College Hospital, Sukkur, Pakistan from June 2009 to June 2011. Eighty patients who were 5-55 years of age, of both genders, with CSOM who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy were included in the study. The operative findings like extent of cholesteatoma, granulation tissue in different location of middle ear cleft and ossicular chain condition and otogenic complication were identified. Result(s): Females were affected more than males (n=48; 60%). Granulation tissue was found in 50 (62.5%) of cases, while cholesteatoma in 30 (37.5%) cases. The extent of diseases was attic in 4 (5%), attic and middle ear in 30 (37.5%), attic and antrum in 16 (20%) and attic, antrum and middle ear in 30 (37%) patients. In majority of the cases there were involvement of more than one ossicle; among the most affected single ossicle malleus was found necrosed in 50 (62.5%) and absent in 6 (7.5%) cases, incus was found necrosed in 42 (52.5%) and stapes was found necrosed in 20 (25%) of cases. Conclusion(s): The primary disease found in our patients undergoing canal wall down mastoidectomy was granulation. Less common were cholesteatoma and multi-ossicular damage.

T1  - The importance of modified techniques of tympanoplasty in the surgical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma. [Bosnian]
AB  - Objective. In order to achieve better postoperative results, lower incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, to overcome a problem of so-called "open mastoid cavity" and to improve auditory function, oto-surgeons apply various modifications of two basic techniques of the tympanoplasty: open (canal wall down-CDW) and closed (canal wall up- CWU). Methods. The total of 100 patients were surgically treated for chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma in the period from 1998 to 2008 at the Clinic of Ear, Throat and Nose Diseases of the University Clinical Centre Banja Luka. Modified approach of the stated techniques of tympanoplasty with the obliteration of the mastoid cavity and reconstruction of the posterior upper wall of the ear canal was applied. Results. Based on the results obtained, we have concluded that the incidence of the recurrent cholesteatoma significantly decreased (5.88%) in patients with whom open technique with the obliteration of the mastoid cavity and reconstruction of the posterior upper wall of the ear canal was applied. Functional results in three patient groups did not significantly differ statistically. An adequate surgical technique should be applied based on clinical and intraoperative findings. Conlusion. Surgical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma due to biological characteristics of cholesteatoma and complex anatomy of the temporal bone still represents a great otosurgical challenge.

T1  - Is there any predictor for tinnitus outcome in different types of otologic surgery?
AB  - Our objective was to determine the effect of different types of otologic surgeries on tinnitus symptoms. Our study consisted of 63 patients who were operated between January and June 2011. Variables such as age, sex, presence of systemic diseases, location and size of the perforation, duration of dry period, type of otological surgery, peroperative presence of cholesteatoma, timpanosclerotic plaques and ossicular chain discontinuity were evaluated. Audiologic evaluation by pure tone audiometry and assessment of THI scores were conducted before surgery and 12 weeks after surgery. There was a very significant difference between preoperative and postoperative mean THI scores (p < 0.01). There was no significant effect of presence of ossicular discontinuity, cholesteatoma, tympanosclerotic plaques, type of surgery or duration of symptoms on the difference of preoperative and postoperative THI scores (p > 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between audiological gain and THI scores (r = 0.355, p < 0.01). In our study, we investigated the relationship between many types of otological surgeries including some preoperative and peroperative pathological findings and tinnitus. As a result, we found that postoperative audiologic gain is an important factor determining outcome of tinnitus in these types of otological surgeries. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

T1  - Clinical features and bacteriology of advanced pediatric otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis
AB  - Objectives: To review the clinical signs, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, bacteriology, and outcome of patients treated for lateral sinus thrombosis (LST). Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective review of nine patients treated with an intraoperatively confirmed diagnosis of LST. Nine patients presenting with LST of otogenic cause were included in this study. All charts related to clinical presentation, operation records, investigations, and other pertinent data were reviewed and analyzed. Result(s): All the patients were children aged 7-12 years. Computed tomography scan revealed the diagnosis of LST. None of the patients responded to initial conservative management. Patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with evacuation of infected thrombus. Cholesteatoma was present in all the ears. Infected thrombi grew gram-negative organisms (Psuedomonas-6, Enterobacter-1, Klebsiella-1, and no growth in the other). Conclusion(s): In children with suppurative otitis media, clinical presentation of ear ache/headache, neck pain, or swelling with papilledema should warrant an evaluation to rule out LST and associated intracranial complications.

T1  - Chronic suppurative otitis media atticoantral- type undergone canal wall down mastoidectomy in a peripheral government hospital of Nepal
AB  - Introduction: Chronic suppurative otitis media is a severe type of chronic ear infection which is quite common in all geographical situations of Nepal. The mainstay of treatment of this disease is surgery, preferably of canal down method. The objective of the study was to identify the common presentation(s) and the clinical and operative finding(s) in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media attico-antral type and evaluation of efficacy of canal-wall down mastoidectomy in the achievement of dry ear and change in hearing in a setting of a peripheral hospital of Nepal in terms of subjectivity. Method(s): Per-operative evaluation of mastoid cavities in terms of types of pathologies and postoperative assessment of ears in terms of achieving a dryness and change in hearing ability was carried out in the ENT Department, Bharatpur Hospital, Chitwan, Nepal. Study was done from January 2005 to December 2010. Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media atticoantral- type were evaluated preoperatively in terms of gross pathologies. Postoperatively, patients were subjectively evaluated twice in six months in reference to persistent ear discharge and change in hearing ability. Result(s): By six months of surgery, 75% of the patients had no discharge. Fifty two patients did not experience any change in hearing ability. Only 16% experienced betterment in hearing while 19% had diminution in hearing. Conclusion(s): Canal wall down mastoidectomies are very effective in controlling otorrhoea and complications related to chronic suppurative otitis media attico-antral type.

T1  - Can early second-look tympanoplasty reduce the rate of conversion to modified radical mastoidectomy?
AB  - Conclusions: Combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second-look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which reduces the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy. Objective(s): The aims of the study were to report the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary CAT surgery and to report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. Method(s): This was a retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. Result(s): In total 132 second-look operations were undertaken, with a mean interval between primary surgery and second-look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second-look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease. Residual disease was defined as cholesteatoma present behind an intact tympanic membrane. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (73.1%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3%) and three cases required a third-look procedure. Â© 2013 Informa Healthcare.

T1  - [Application of autogenous bone pate for atticus reconstruction and mastoid cavity obliteration in tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy]. [Chinese]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the curative effect of autogenous bone pate for atticus reconstitution and mastoid cavity obliteration in canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty. METHOD: The 60 patients (60 ears) of cholesteatomatous tympanitis were randomly divided into 2 groups. The experimental group underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty and using autogenous bone pate for atticus reconstitution and mastoid cavity obliteration. The control group only underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty. All patients were followed up for 0.5-2 years. Improvement of hearing and dry ear time in these two groups was retrospectively observed. RESULTS: There are significant difference between two groups in improvement of hearing and dry ear time, according to follow-up and analysis of therapeutic efficacy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Hearing can be improved, dry ear time can be shorten and correlative complication can be decreased by atticus reconstruction and mastoid cavity obliteration with autogenous bone pate in canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty, which guarantees the normal activity space of auditory bone chain.

T1  - Evaluation of hearing results after tympanoplasty according to the classification of the development degree for pars flaccid cholesteatoma. [Japanese]
AB  - Our surgical treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma is based on the following 2 concepts: (1) Preservation of the physiological morphology and function of the middle ear, that is, maximal preservation of the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus and the middle ear mucosa and (2) Careful resection of the matrix membrane of the cholesteatoma through the continuity of the matrix membrane. In case the cholesteatoma matrix membrane is ruptured, a staged operation should be performed to prevent the development of residual cholesteatoma from the residual matrix. In this study, we classified a total of 238 cases of the pars flaccida cholesteatoma primary operated on Osaka Red Cross Hospital between January 2006 and March 2008 according to the Classification and Staging of Cholesteatoma proposed in 2010. The age of the patients ranged from 4 to 79 years (average: 49.8 years) and there werel23 males and 115 females. Follow up ranged from 1 year to 5 years with a mean follow-up period of 47.8 months. Regarding the stage, 38 (16.0%) ears had stage I cholesteatoma, 155 (65.1%) ears had stage II, and 45 (18.9%) ears had stage III. The successful outcome rate was 97.4% for stage I, 78.7% for stage II and 60.0% for stage III. The rate of the residue and the postoperative recurrence was 2.5% and 4.2%.

T1  - Osteoma and cholesteatoma of the external auditory canal
AB  - Introduction: Osteoma and cholesteatoma of the external auditory canal (EAC) is a rare disease, with only a few reports describing this association in the current literature. Aim(s): To establish the potential complications arising from this association and report on the surgical outcomes Methods: A literature search (PubMed) and case review of this dual EAC pathology. Result(s): 4 cases were identified (3 from the world literature, 1 from recent departmental experience). Clinical imaging (MRI/CT) were performed in 3/4 cases. Most were under under 25 years of age (3/4) and had posterior canal wall erosion.3/4 patients had advanced extra-canal disease atpresentation, of which 2 needed a canal wall down technique for disease clearance in the mastoid and the third requiring mastoid exploration via a cortical mastoidectomy. Extra-temporal anatomical sites such as the cerebellum and neck were involved in 2 cases. Canal wall reconstruction (temporalis fascia graft) was performed in 1 case only andmost cases (3/4)were found to be clinically disease free at 6months. All cases had evidence of EAC sepsis at presentation. Conclusion(s): We recommend having a low threshold for examination of the entirety of the EAC via imaging or surgical exploration when this association is suspected.

T1  - The role of otoendoscopy in detecting residual and recurrent cholesteatoma after microdissection
AB  - Objectives: Determine the efficacy of otoendoscopy in detecting residual and recurrent cholesteatoma after traditional microdissection. Method(s): Retrospective review of 273 consecutive cases on 215 patients who underwent cholesteatoma surgery with or without otoendoscopy from May 2006 to January 2013 at a tertiary referral center. Main Outcome Measure(s): The incidence of residual cholesteatoma after microsurgery that was found by angled otoendoscopes, and of recurrent cholesteatoma on second look procedures. Result(s): Otoendoscopy was used in 48% of the cases. Of the 114 canal wall down mastoidectomies, otoendoscopy was used in 11.7%. There were 47 (17.2%) second look procedures. Of the 124 cases of cholesteatoma surgeries using otoenedoscopy, residual cholesteatoma was found in 66 cases (53.2%). Residual cholesteatoma was most frequently found in the epitympanum (30.7%), followed by the sinus tympani and oval window (each at 9.6%). The overall recurrent cholesteatoma rate found on second look surgery was 5.1% (14 of 273). Cholesteatoma was found in 10 of 27 cases (37%) when otoendoscopy was used in the primary surgery, and in 11 of 20 cases (55%) when otoendoscopy was not used in primary surgery. Residual cholesteatoma was missed by microsurgery but found by otoendoscopy in 8 of 21 cases (38.1%). There was no significant difference in the locations of the residual and recurrent cholesteatoma, found by otoendoscopy or microsurgery (P = 1). Conclusion(s): Otoendoscopy can decrease the rate of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma and should be included in the armamentarium of all otologists.

T1  - Does mastoid obliteration following mastoidectomy offer an improvement in quality of life?
AB  - Objectives: 1) Recognize the impact mastoidectomy with obliteration has on quality of life (QOL). 2) Describe the QOL change with primary or secondary mastoid obliteration with autologous bone graft. 3) Review of the literature on mastoid obliteration. Method(s): This retrospective observational study was conducted to determine if mastoid obliteration with autologous cranial bone graft following mastoidectomy improves QOL. Patients with cholesteatoma who had mastoidectomy with primary or secondary mastoid obliteration by a tertiary otologist were surveyed using the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), our primary outcome measure. Our secondary outcomes were recurrence rates. Result(s): Fifty-five patients were interviewed: 44 were primary obliterations, and 11 were secondary obliterations of an existing mastoid cavity. Overall GBI scores were improved, with average scores of 25. Average general subscale scores were 26, physical health scores were 22, and social health scores were 24. The primary obliteration group had average scores of 22, general subscale scores of 23, physical health scores of 21, and social health scores of 19. Those with secondary obliteration scored higher, with average scores of 37, general subscale scores of 40, physical health scores of 21, and social health scores of 42. Recurrence rates were comparable with the current literature. Conclusion(s): This study shows that mastoidectomy with obliteration using autologous cranial bone graft offers a significant QOL benefit. The GBI scores compare favorably with other otology procedures. Secondary obliterations after revision mastoidectomy scored much higher than primary obliterations. This is currently the only QOL study comparing these two patient groups.

T1  - Long-term safety of tympanomastoid obliteration for children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears
AB  - Objectives: Analyze long-term prognosis and safety in children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears following tympanomastoidectomy with cartilage obliteration. Method(s): During a 30-year period (1982-2012), the medical records of children (<=18 years) with cholesteatomas after primary tympanomastoidectomies with cartilage obliteration were analyzed. The recidivism rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Potential predictors of recidivism were entered into a Cox's regression model as covariates for multivariate analysis. These factors were sex, tympanomastoid obliteration, eardrum perforation, ossicular destruction, facial nerve dehiscence, history of ventilation tube insertion, craniofacial abnormality, surgical technique, and extent of disease. Result(s): Among a total of 150 cholesteatomatous ears in 146 children, there were 95 discharging ears (63%) in 94 children. Among the 95 discharging ears, tympanomastoidectomy was performed with cartilage obliteration (CO group) in 77 ears (81%) and without cartilage obliteration (WO group) in 18 ears (19%). The mean follow-up period was 11.6 +/- 8.1 years. Recidivism was observed in 16 years in the CO group (12 recurrent and 4 residual) and 4 in the WO group (2 recurrent and 2 residual). The 10-year cumulative recidivism rates were comparable between CO and WO groups (19% vs. 25%, P = 0.762, log-rank). Multivariate analysis indicated that tympanomastoid obliteration was not a negative predictor of recidivism (P = 0.760), while surgical technique (canal wall up vs. down; hazard ratio = 5.86, P = 0.011) was a significant predictor. Major long-term complications were not observed. Conclusion(s): This study provides long-term evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of tympanomastoid cartilage obliteration for children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears.

T1  - The correlation between presenting features and surgical outcomes in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Objectives: Determine how presenting features of cholesteatoma in children influence surgical outcome. Method(s): A prospective database of 319 consecutive children with cholesteatoma was analyzed to compare features of cholesteatoma at presentation with patient-focused outcome measures. Features of disease included the presence of otorrhea, hearing loss (mean 4 tone air conduction audiogram more than 30dB HL), the type and extent of cholesteatoma, and ossicular status. Outcomes included hearing threshold, number of surgeries, and canal wall preservation. Cases with cholesteatoma surgery or tympanoplasty prior to referral were excluded. Result(s): Of 200 children with cholesteatomas, 32 ears presented with congenital lesions and 178 ears presented with acquired lesions. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.6 years for congenital and 11.5 years for acquired cholesteatoma. A history of continuous otorrhea had a sensitivity of 0% for diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma and 37% for acquired. Hearing loss had a sensitivity of 57% for congenital and 72% for acquired cholesteatoma. The canal wall was preserved in 181 (86%) ears at first surgery. Mean hearing level was unchanged after surgery at 36dB HL. More extensive cholesteatoma correlated with more ossicular erosion, more canal wall down surgery, worse postoperative hearing, and more repeated surgeries (P < 0.05; multiple regression analysis). Conclusion(s): Better outcomes for children with cholesteatoma can be achieved by early identification and surgery when lesions are smaller. As cholesteatoma can be relatively silent in children, without otorrhea or hearing loss. Physicians must be trained to identify otoscopic features of congenital and acquired cholesteatoma and initiate prompt referral.

T1  - Single flap with three pedicles, bone pate and split-thickness skin graft for immediate mastoid obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - Our objective was to evaluate single flap with three pedicles, bone pate and split-thickness skin graft for mastoid cavity obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomy done for chronic suppurative otitis media and its efficacy in producing a small and dry mastoid cavity. Over a period of 7 years (2003-2010), 100 consecutive procedures in 100 patients with chronic suppurative otitis media were performed at the Mansoura University Hospital (Egypt) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months (range 12-72 months). All patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty. Anteriorly, inferiorly and superiorly pedicled periosteal flap, which was covered by split-thickness skin graft, was used in conjunction with autologous bone pate to obliterate the mastoid cavity. Postoperative evaluation was done based on certain criteria and grading system from 0 to 3. Grade 0 is considered perfect, grade 3 represents failure and grade 1 and 2 are adequate but not perfect. The summation of grade "0" (perfect dry) and grade "1" (adequate dry) was 88, 95, 97.23 and 98.44% after follow-up periods of 12, 24, 36 and 48 months, and 100% after 60 and 72 months. Periosteal flap based on three pedicles (anterior, inferior and superior) covering the bone pate is simple, perfect and adequate for obliteration of mastoid cavity after canal wall down mastoidectomy. Split-thickness skin graft is important to hasten the epithelialization that helps to obtain a dry cavity. The use of local tissues saves costs and avoids complications from the synthetic materials.

T1  - Clinical presentation and outcome of mastoidectomy in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) at tertiary care hospital, Sukkur, Pakistan
AB  - Objective To determine the clinical presentation and out come of Mastoidectomy in Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM). Patients and Methods This prospective interventional descriptive study was conducted in the departments of Otolaryngology and Pediatrics, Ghulam Muhammad Mahar Medical College Hospital at Shaheed Mohtrama Benazir Bhutto Medical University, Sukkur, Pakistan from June 2007 to June 2011. Sixty consecutive patients of age 5-50 years included in the study presented with CSOM. Pertinent clinical history and examination, investigations, and outcome of mastoidectomy were noted Results Out of 60 patients, the most affected age group was between 11-20 years and 36 (60%) were female. All patients had chronic discharging ears and conducting deafness. Six (10%) cases had severe degree of hearing impairment greater than 50 dB loss, 45(75%) cases had moderate degree of hearing impairment (31to 50 dB) while 9 (15%) had mild hearing impairment less than 30 dB loss. Subtotal tympanic membrane perforation was seen in 30 (50%) cases followed by central type of perforation in17 (28%) patients. Thick odorous discharge was present in 30 (50%) followed by purulent discharge in15 (25%) cases. In 45 (75%) cases, canal wall down mastoidectomy was carried out without tympanoplasty. In 15 patients, mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty was done and these were excluded from the study. The surgical approach was post aural in all cases. The granulation tissue (granuloma) was present in 38 (63.5%) and cholesteatoma in 22 (36.5%) cases in middle ear cavity. The dry ear was in 32 (80%) and 8 (20%) patients has discharging ear at the end of 2 month follow-up. Recurrence of granulation tissue was found in 7 (17.5%) patients and cholesteatoma in 3 (7.5%) patients at the end of follow up. Conclusion CSOM was in poor socio economic class and was associated with moderate degree of hearing loss in most of the patients. Mastoidectomy was effective in controlling the recurrence of granulation tissue, choesteatoma and otorrhea to a greater extent.

T1  - Detection of post operative residual cholesteatoma using PROPELLER DWI combined with conventional MRI
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to determine the role of PROPELLER diffusion-weighted MR imaging combined with conventional MR imaging for the detection of residual cholesteatoma in patients who have undergone middle ear surgery. Subjects and methods: Twenty patients who had undergone resection of cholesteatoma were referred for MR imaging. MR imaging (1.5 T) was performed using a PROPELLER DWI, T2WI, FLAIR and T1WI before and after IV injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine. An experienced reviewer evaluated the diffusion-weighted MR images for the presence of a high-signal-intensity and calculated corresponding ADC values. Imaging findings were correlated with findings from surgery in 14 patients and with findings from clinical follow-up examination in six patients. Result(s): Diffusion-weighted MR imaging combined with conventional MR imaging depicted eight cholesteatomas. Two lesions were missed that were <3 mm. One patient was misdiagnosed as cholesteatoma, biopsy revealed acute inflammation. Sensitivity was 80%, specificity was 90%, positive predictive value was 89% and negative predictive value was 82%. Conclusion(s): Diffusion-weighted MR imaging combined with conventional MRI and calculation of ADC values is useful in the detection of secondary cholesteatoma and would decrease the need for un-necessary second canal wall-up operation.

T1  - Bismuth iodoform paraffin paste hypersensitivity reactions in mastoid cavities following isolation of mucosal lining: A series of 587 patients
AB  - Aim: (1) To assess hypersensitivity to bismuth iodoform paraffin paste impregnated ribbon gauze following its use in packing canal wall down mastoidectomy cavities; (2) to determine if isolation of the skin and mucosa from the pack, using thin Silastic sheeting and Cortisporin ointment, reduces hypersensitivity reactions, compared with a previous series; and (3) to review the literature and to determine if bismuth iodoform paraffin paste hypersensitivity precludes the consumption of seafood (due to its high iodine content).Materials and methods: All patients undergoing canal wall down mastoidectomy with intra-operative bismuth iodoform paraffin paste packing between 1985 and 2009 were identified and reviewed. Result(s): Of 587 patients identified, the overall bismuth iodoform paraffin paste reaction rate was 1 per cent. All reactions were in patients undergoing revision mastoidectomy procedures, giving a reaction rate for revision procedures of 2.4 per cent. Conclusion(s): Reactions are an uncommon event following post-operative mastoid cavity packing using bismuth iodoform paraffin paste. Reaction rates may be lowered by preparing the cavity with Silastic sheeting and Cortisporin ointment prior to packing, thus isolating the skin and mucosal surfaces. Development of such a reaction does not preclude the consumption of seafood. Â© 2012 JLO (1984) Limited.

T1  - Mastoidectomy cavity obliteration with bioactive glass: A pilot study
AB  - Objective. To show that mastoid cavities with continuous infections and cleaning problems can be obliterated with bioactive glass (BG) and to present results of a pilot study for 16 operations on adults. Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Paijat-Hame Central Hospital, Finland-a single ear, nose, and throat (ENT) hospital department serving a population of 216,000. Subjects and Methods. Fourteen patients had a large open radical cavity with recurrent infections. Two ears had discharge and pain after simple mastoidectomy. A re-mastoidectomy included support of the cavity skin and obliteration with BG. The mean follow-up time was 2.2 years. Results. All ears became dry. One reoperation was needed as the fascia support to the ear canal (EC) skin was too weak, and part of the BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry, and the missing BG was replaced in a reoperation. A slightly short musculoperiosteal flap supported the EC skin in 1 ear. A minor amount of BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry. The aim was an ample ear canal. One ear was overfilled and required meatoplasty. Simple mastoid cavities were isolated from the middle ear and become asymptomatic. Conclusions. In this pilot study, BG works safely and with success as an obliteration material in problematic open radical cavities. Bioactive glass seems to tolerate chronic infection in the mastoid and prevent postoperative infections. Â© 2012 American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration and reconstruction: A review of techniques and results
AB  - The aim of cholesteatoma surgery is to obtain a safe, dry and self-cleaning ear. Several methods have been tried and tested to achieve this goal with varying degrees of success. This article reviews some of the more common methods for mastoid reconstruction and obliteration and their results. Current trends appear to favour a combination of mastoid obliteration and reconstructive techniques, with biologic materials such as muscle flaps and bone chips preferred over non-biologic materials such as hydroxyapatite crystals and ceramic. However, there is large variation among the type of biologic flap used, which can vary between fascia, muscle and periosteum. After an extensive review, there is no ideal method for mastoid obliteration and reconstruction, as most methods appear to have a certain degree of success. The basic principles of a low facial ridge, large meatoplasty and an oval mastoid cavity should be adhered to, and the surgeon should choose a method that he or she is comfortable with.

T1  - The management of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis - A 6 year experience at a tertiary care hospital in north Karnataka, India
AB  - Introduction: Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) can give rise to serious intracranial complications. Lateral Sinus Thrombosis (LST) is a rare complication but if it left untreated, can give rise to serious consequences. The objective of this study was to put forth a strategy in the management of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis with the available resources, considering the low socio economic status of many patients who suffer from this rare but fatal condition. This will encourage the young ENT surgeons to handle these cases efficiently. Material(s) and Method(s): Eleven (11) cases of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis of a tertiary care teaching hospital in the north Karnataka region of India were included in the study. All the cases presented with various symptoms like otorrhoea, otalgia, headache and fever. The patients were investigated by doing High Resolution Computed Tomography of temporal bone and brain with intravenous contrast. The cases underwent mastoidectomy with opening of the sinus contents and they were covered with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics. The HRCT of the temporal bone was the only radiological investigation which was carried out in diagnosing the cases, as the patients were from a poor socioeconomic status and as they could not afford to undergo higher investigations like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Venography (MRV) to confirm the diagnosis because of their high costs. Result(s): There were no deaths. A combined management strategy of surgery with antibiotics gave a good prognosis in these cases. Conclusion(s): In this era of antibiotics, a high degree of clinical suspicion with a proper investigation, followed by a prompt surgical intervention, gives good results in the cases of lateral sinus thrombosis.

T1  - The use of MRI DWI-imaging in assessment of cholesteatoma recurrences after canal wall up technique. [Polish]
AB  - Introduction: The use of closed technique in cholesteatoma treatment carries a significant risk of development of residual disease thus requires a second look operation in a proportion of patients. In those with no residual cholesteatoma the second surgery could be avoided. The aim of the study: was to evaluate the use of non-echo planar HASTE diffusion-weighted MR imaging in the detection of cholesteatoma in patients after canal wall up surgery due to cholesteatoma. Material(s) and Method(s): We evaluate the results of half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo (HASTE) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in 18 patients after canal wall up surgery performed 6 to 20 months after primary surgery. 16 patients were operated in our center and 2 elsewhere. All the patients underwent second look surgery that verified the result of MRI scanning. Result(s): MRI DWI detected 2 cholesteatomas in patients operated elsewhere and none in patients operated in our center. Four cholesteatomas were found during second look operations. Two false negatives were in 1 patient with cholesteatoma pearl of less than 2 mm in diameter and in 1 patient with mural cholesteatoma. There were no false positive results. Conclusion(s): Non EPI MRI DWI can be used as a screening tool to detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma and may substitute the need of second look surgery.

T1  - Inner ear effects of canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the inner ear effects of canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) with regard to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and reported tinnitus and dizziness-related disability.Setting. Tertiary care academic medical center.Subjects and Methods. Prospective study of 86 patients treated by CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM with or without cholesteatoma. Standard patient workup included preoperative audiogram and completion of 2 surveys: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Patients underwent repeat audiogram, DHI, and THI surveys at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative data were analyzed.Results. No significant SNHL occurred after CWD mastoidectomy. Thirteen patients (13/34 [38%]) had DHI improvement greater than 18 points, indicating a significant improvement in dizziness-related disability. Three patients developed new-onset postoperative dizziness complaints. Twenty patients (20/43 [46.5%]) had THI improvement greater than 7 points, indicating a significant improvement in tinnitus-related disability. Five patients developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus complaints. The odds ratio for improving DHI and THI scores after surgery was 6.6 (1.8 to 25.0) and 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.45% to 12.2%), respectively.Conclusion. In this study, CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of COM did not cause significant SNHL. In addition, using the DHI and THI measures, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus, respectively, was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.

T1  - Differences in middle ear ventilation disorders between pars flaccida and pars tensa cholesteatoma in sonotubometry and patterns of tympanic and mastoid pneumatization
AB  - To investigate differences in middle ear ventilation mechanisms between pars flaccida and pars tensa cholesteatoma. Retrospective case review. A referral hospital otolaryngology department. Sixty-six ears with pars flaccida cholesteatoma (mean age, 45.7 yr) and 19 ears with pars tensa cholesteatoma (mean age, 58.8 yr) were included. Patients with totally adhesive tympanic membranes or mixed-type cholesteatoma were excluded. Patients underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction. The canal wall was reconstructed with tragal or conchal cartilage and cortical bone grafts. Habitual sniffing, preoperative sonotubometry results, mastoid pneumatization (maturation), and postoperative aeration around the stapes were investigated. Preoperative mastoid pneumatization and postoperative aeration around the stapes were measured on computed tomography scans. Ten (15.4%) of 65 patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma and 3 (15.7%) of 19 patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma were habitual sniffers (p = 0.5). Preoperative sonotubometry indicated that a patulous pattern was more common in ears with pars flaccida than pars tensa cholesteatoma (42.8% versus 7.1%, p < 0.05), and a stenotic pattern was more common in ears with pars tensa than pars flaccida cholesteatoma (85.8% versus 42.8%, p < 0.01). Preoperative mastoid pneumatization and postoperative aeration around the stapes were significantly better in ears with pars flaccida than pars tensa cholesteatoma (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Significantly different tubal function and mastoid pneumatization patterns suggest differences in ventilation disorders and cause between ears with pars flaccida and pars tensa cholesteatoma.

T1  - [Canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty surgery preserving chorda tympani nerve integrality]. [Chinese]
AB  - To report the way for searching the chorda tympani nerve and the significance for preserving the chorda tympani nerve during canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty surgery. Sixty-six cases with chronic suppurative otitis media underwent canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty surgery. According to the marker of the short crus of incus, the posterior wall of auditory canal was lowered and crista of the chorda tympani nerve was found through tracing the facial nerve contour. The chorda tympani nerve was preserved after clearing the surrounding tissue. Among the 66 cases, 24 cases had middle ear cholesteatoma, 42 cases had granulation in middle ear. The cholesteatoma and granulation on the surface of the chorda tympani nerve were cleared thoroughly. No neurotmesis or obvious change of taste occurred after operation. Canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty surgery preserving chorda tympani nerve integrality may preserve the structure and function of the chorda tympani nerve, reduce the risk of ossicle extrusion above the head of stapes and serve as a frame for transplanting fascia.

T1  - Transmastoid approach to repair meningoencephalic herniation in the middle ear
AB  - Introduction: Meningoencephalic herniation (MEH) into the middle ear and mastoid is a rare pathological entity. The etiologies of the bone defect, necessary for the development of a brain herniation, include temporal bone trauma, iatrogenic injuries, chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, congenital cranial base defects, neoplasia, irradiation, and idiopathic causes. Material(s) and Method(s): We treated 24 patients. A transmastoid approach was performed, and the MEH pushed up to the bony defect and supported by a heterologous materials positioned in a multilayer way. Result(s): The cause of the bony defect was chronic otitis media with iatrogenic, spontaneous, and post-traumatic cholesteatoma. The major presenting symptoms related to the presence of a MEH were meningitis, headache, conductive hearing loss, headache, CSF leak, neurologic deficit, pneumoencephalos, and stenosis of a canal wall down cavity. The follow-up was 28 months on average. During follow-up, no patients developed complications due to the surgery or related to the pathology. TC scan and MR imaging showed a stable occlusion of the bony defect. Conclusion(s): Different surgical treatments are proposed to repair MEH, and the choice has to be based on the localization and size of the bony defect, the preoperative auditory function, and the presence of other coexisting pathology. A transmastoid approach is helpful for treating small dehiscences (up to 2 cm); obviously, the bony defect does not have to reach the anterior epitympanum if the ossicular chain is still in place.

T1  - Acquired cholesteatoma in pre-school aged children
AB  - Objectives: It is a widely held opinion that acquired cholesteatoma in very young children behaves differently to the same disease in older children and adults. We present our experience of patients aged 5 and under with acquired cholesteatoma and discuss their presentation and outcomes in relation to published data on general paediatric and adult patients. Method(s): Retrospective case note review. Result(s): Fifteen cases were identified over a 7 year period. Typical presentation was with persistent unilateral otorrhoea. The disease was often extensive and in many cases required revision surgery. A number of children who had canal wall down surgery did not tolerate aural toilet in the outpatient clinic and needed to have this performed under anaesthetic. Long term hearing outcomes and disease recurrence rates will be discussed. Conclusion(s): There are aspects of the surgery and post-operative care of cholesteatoma in very young children that differ from that in older patients, in particular the surgical approach; the need for increased vigilance for detection of recurrence, and the problems with doing so, either in the outpatient clinic or radiologically; and their hearing rehabilitation. There was frequently a significant delay in referral for treatment; because recurrent acute otitis media is relatively common in this age group, we suspect that primary care physicians may not suspect cholesteatoma as a cause for a chronically discharging ear in a preschool child. Our experience of cholesteatoma in these children is of an aggressive disease whose management deserves special consideration.

T1  - Post-operative follow up of cholesteatoma-how long is adequate?
AB  - Objectives: To determine the optimal duration of follow up for patients with cholesteatoma treated by Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy (CWDM) and whether the duration varies according to subgroups. Method(s): A prospective observational study of the post-operative recurrence pattern of cholesteatoma over 17 years. A total of 405 cases are included. Subgroup analyses included: paediatric versus adult patients; bilateral versus unilateral disease; extent and location of cholesteatoma. Both Kaplan-Meyer and simple recurrence rate calculations have been employed. Result(s): Mean follow up period was 46.7 months. Ninety-four percent of recurrences occurred before 5 years. Recurrence was more likely in children than in adults (P = 0.034) Paediatric recurrences occurred earlier than in adult patients. Other subgroup analyses failed to reach statistical significance. A significant loss to follow up was observed. Conclusion(s): Our data supports a follow up period of at least 5 years after Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy for removal of cholesteatoma. No particular subgroups require longer follow up than others.

T1  - Staging primary middle ear cholesteatoma with non-echoplanar (HASTE) diffusion weighted MRI helps plan surgery
AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of HASTE non EPI diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) in staging of primary middle ear cholesteatoma in patients with complete soft tissue opacification of the middle ear cleft on CT. This helps plan the surgical approach. Method(s): Retrospective observational study. Twenty-two patients with clinical and CT diagnosis of primary cholesteatoma AND with complete soft tissue opacification of the middle ear and mastoid on CT underwent DWMRI to determine the true extent of cholesteatoma. 1 Stage 1 - Cholesteatoma limited to the middle ear cavity and hence suitable for 'front to back' atticotomy with cartilage reconstruction. 2 Stage 2 - Cholesteatoma involving middle ear and mastoid additus and hence suitable for 'front to back' atticoantrostomy with cartilage reconstruction. 3 Stage 3 - Cholesteatoma in the middle ear and mastoid and hence suitable for 'back to front' combined approach mastoidectomy (canal wall up procedure). DWI staging was correlated with surgical findings and kappa statistic was used to examine the agreement. Result(s): At surgery, six patients had stage 1 disease, six patients stage 2 disease and 10 patients stage 3 disease. DWMRI accurately staged the cholesteatoma in 21 patients. The estimated Kappa value of 0.90 (0.56, 1.00) indicates very good agreement between the DWMRI and surgical findings. Conclusion(s): DWMRI correlates well with surgical findings for determining the true extent and hence staging of primary cholesteatoma in patients with complete opacification of the middle ear cleft on CT. In these patients, DWMRI can help plan surgery.

T1  - Attic reconstruction in pediatric canal wall-up mastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: 1) To evaluate 3 methods: conchal cartilage, tragal cartilage, and bone pate, for primary attic reconstruction (scutumplasty) in pediatric canal wall-up mastoidectomies in terms of recurrence rates and formation of retraction pockets. Method(s): All patients undergoing attic reconstruction following a canal wall up mastoidectomy were evaluated from a single surgeon prospective pediatric otological database maintained over a 10-year period. The reconstruction of the scutum defects was done using bone pate, conchal and tragal cartilage. The outcome measures were postoperative retraction pocket formation and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Result(s): A total of 120 patients underwent primary attic reconstruction following canal wall-up mastoidectomy over a 10-year period. The overall recurrence rate was 9.83% (n = 12). Fifty-one patients underwent attic reconstruction with tragal cartilage, while 33 were reconstructed using conchal cartilage and 36 with bone pate. The recurrence rate with various reconstruction methods was 5.8% (n = 2), 15.1% (n = 5), and 13.8% (n = 5) for tragal, conchal, and bone pate, respectively. Cholesteatoma recurrence rates with the use of tragal cartilage for reconstruction of the scutum were significantly lower as compared to that of conchal cartilage (P = .034, chi square = 3.308) and bone pate (P = .046, chi square = 2.834). Conclusion(s): The use of the tragal cartilage for scutum reconstruction is associated with the least recurrence rate for pediatric cholesteatoma. The easy accessibility, stability, and good long-term results with the use of the tragal cartilage makes it an ideal material for outer attic wall reconstruction in pediatric canal wall up mastoidectomies.

T1  - Clinical analysis of 22 cases of automastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: Automastoidectomy is a destructive condition of the mastoid and middle ear cavity about which very little has been reported. 1) Know the clinical features and severities of automastoidectomy caused by chronic otitis media. 2) Evaluate the results of its surgical outcomes. Method(s): Retrospective study. Patients who visited outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with COM with automastoidectomy state by temporal bone CT from January 2003 to December 2011 were included in this study. All patients underwent surgery. Their postoperative states were evaluated at the outpatient clinic at least 6 months after surgery. Result(s): Two patients complained of facial palsy, 7 hearing disturbance, 10 otorrhea, and 3 otalgia. At physical examination, attic destruction and retracted tympanic membrane (TM) were observed in 12 patients, EAC destruction in 8, TM perforation in 4, and 1 had intact TM. All pathologic results were cholesteatoma. A total of 19 had canal wall down mastoidectomy, 2 had canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and 1 had subtotal petrosectomy. One had tympanoplasty type 1, 3 had columella over stapes head, 10 had interposition or columella over stapedial footplate and, 1 had tympanoplasty type 3. Overall hearing improvement rate was 9.0%. There was no recurrence. Conclusion(s): Automastoidectomy is a relatively rare condition of middle ear diseases. It could be caused by cholesteatomatous COM and non-cholesteatomatous COM. Hearing reconstructive procedures are generally not effective compared with other conditions. This study may be helpful to know the clinical features and surgical outcomes of this condition.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Recurrence factors
AB  - Objective: Canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is gaining popularity in the treatment for cholesteatoma. The choice remains controversial because of the significant recurrence rate of this disease. We aimed to analyze tympanomastoidectomy success rate, to establish eventual predictive factors for failure, and to evaluate the computed tomography (CT) scan's value in this pathology. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study regarding all patients submitted to tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma at the otolaryngology department of Hospital Sao Jose, Lisbon, from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Result(s): One hundred nineteen patients were submitted to tympanomastoidectomy. In most cases, preoperative CT scans showed cholesteatoma in the attic (50%) and large extension of the disease (tegmen, semicircular or fallopian canal erosion in 51%), not always confirmed during surgery (75%). Sixty percent had a canal wall-down procedure. The overall postoperative air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 44%. Second-look surgery was performed in 24 patients: the overall recurrence rate was 23%, with conversion to canal wall-down procedure in 67%. Factors identified as related to failure: cholesteatoma in the sinus tympani (33%), scutum erosion (29%), and large extension of disease (40%). Conclusion(s): The recurrence rate was significant, despite the high percentage of canal wall-down procedures. Factors for failure remain uncertain and CT scans presented limited value in the diagnosis and evaluation of cholesteatoma, especially postoperatively. In the absence of better diagnostic procedures, we recommend second look surgery to control cholesteatoma's recurrence.

T1  - Evaluation of second look procedures for pediatric cholesteatomas
AB  - Objective. This study aims to identify factors that may help predict recurrence, the need for second-look operations, and other outcomes in the pediatric population. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary medical center. Subjects and Methods. Five hundred and seventeen ears in 493 patients underwent primary acquired cholesteatoma resection over a 37-year period. Demographic (age, sex, and other medical conditions), cholesteatoma laterality, presence of perforation or otorrhea on otoscopic exam, preoperative and most recent audiologic data, and detailed intraoperative data were collected. Results. Overall, 47.2% of patients underwent second-look operations, with 48.0% having recurrent cholesteatoma visualized with attic recurrence being the most common location. In total, 22.7% of all patients in this study had recurrent disease. Factors at initial operation associated with a statistically significant increased risk of recurrence included cholesteatoma in the sinus tympani (odds ratio = 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.36-3.22) and incus destruction (1.65; 1.01-2.71). Conclusion. The authors have successfully identified multiple factors at the time of initial operation that can have significant postoperative implications.

T1  - Relationship between postoperative aeration around the stapes and postoperative hearing outcome after canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction for cholesteatoma
AB  - To evaluate the correlation between postoperative aeration around the stapes and hearing outcome after canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction for cholesteatoma. Retrospective case review. University hospital otolaryngology department. Seventy ears of 65 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were included. Patients who had fixed or poorly mobile ossicular chain was excluded. They were underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with canal reconstruction. Canal wall was reconstructed with the tragal or conchal cartilage and the cortical bone plate. We measured aeration around the stapes on coronal and axial computed tomographic sections at 1 year after ossiculoplasty and investigated the correlation between postoperative aeration around the stapes and postoperative air-bone gap (using the mean of 0.5-, 1-, and 2-kHz threshold values) at 1 year after ossiculoplasty. We also investigated it for each of Wullstein type and for each of 0.25-, 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and 4-kHz thresholds. Aeration around the stapes was negatively correlated with postoperative air-bone gap (correlation coefficient, -0.53; p < 0.05). Types I and IV tympanoplasty had a higher correlation with postoperative air-bone gap than type III tympanoplasty. The 0.5-KHz frequency had a higher correlation with postoperative air bone gap than other frequencies. Measurement of postoperative aeration around the stapes is an effective method for evaluating the importance of middle ear aeration. Aeration around the stapes contributes to better hearing outcome.

T1  - Intraoperative findings during canal wall down mastoidectomy in children
AB  - Objective: The main objective of this study is to assess the intraoperative finding during canal wall down mastoidectomy in paediatric patients undergoing surgery for unsafe type of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) attending ENT OPD of Kathmandu Medical College. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty patients of age group 4 to 13 years who were suffering from unsafe type of CSOM with or without cholesteatoma were taken for the study. The study period was two years from April 2007 to March 2009. The operative findings like extent of cholesteatoma in different location of middle ear cleft, mastoid bony landmarks, and ossicular chain condition and otogenic complication were identified during canal wall down mastoidectomy. Result(s): Of the 50 patients 32 (64%) were boys and 18(36%) were girls. The age ranged from 4 years to 13 years. Majority of patients had cholesteatoma with granulation diseases (72%) followed by granulation diseases (16%). Involvement of disease in attic, aditus, antrum and mesotympanum were found to be high in majority of cases (82%) with high percentage of necrosis of incus (56%). Conclusion(s): The primary disease found in patients undergoing canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) was cholesteatoma combined with granulation in72%, granulation in 16% and cholesteatoma in12%.

T1  - Bone tissue substitutes and replacements
AB  - Purpose of review: A host of synthetically engineered materials have come to market in the past three decades, changing the way surgical reconstruction is performed. Although tissue engineering holds the promise of true tissue replacement, this technology is years away from true clinical use. In the interim, understanding of the current synthetic bone substitutes will be reviewed to provide the clinician with an updated understanding of the different classes along with advantages, disadvantages and novel applications. Recent findings: A discussion of currently used bone cements, scaffolds, bone matrices and growth factors will be included. In addition, a sampling of exciting basic science experiments and preliminary treatments for synthetic bone reconstruction is covered. Summary: Each reconstructive surgeon should have a comprehensive understanding of the current technologies to optimize reconstruction of bony defects. As this field is rapidly changing, new iterations arrive yearly, which possess improved osteoconductive, osteoinductive, osteointegrative and osteogenic properties. A better understanding of these new products and material will allow each reconstructive surgeon the ability to provide patients with the safest and most successful reconstruction.

T1  - Hearing outcomes in canal wall down mastoidectomy with cartilage tympanoplasty
AB  - Objective: 1) Measure the overall postoperative hearing after both canal wall down mastoidectomy and cartilage tympanoplasty. 2) Assess the air-bone gap postoperatively in patients after both canal wall down mastoidectomy and cartilage tympanoplasty. Method(s): A retrospective review of all patients who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with a cartilage tympanoplasty during the time period of 2000 to 2010. Cases of the appropriate surgery were chosen by operative reports. Indications for surgery largely included cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media, or both. Result(s): A total of 39 patients were found to have the procedure in question with 30 patients having full audiograms for review. Preand postoperative pure tone averages (PTA) along with air-bone gaps (ABG) were reviewed at 500 Hz, 1,000 Hz, 2,000 Hz, and 4,000 Hz. Postoperative PTA showed an improvement of 7.2 dB over preoperative PTA. Postoperative ABG showed an improvement of 4.53 dB over preoperative ABG. The ABG improvement was found to be statistically significant with a P value of .0285. Conclusion(s): The results of this study demonstrate that hearing results following a canal wall down mastoidectomy along with a cartilage tympanoplasty not only have acceptable hearing results but also actually show an improvement over preoperative audiological function.

T1  - Age and time interval differences in recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates for canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: 1) Evaluate whether residual or recurrent cholesteatoma found during second-look tympanomastoidectomies correlates with age. 2) To evaluate whether there is a difference in residual or recurrent cholesteatoma found during second-look tympanomastoidectomies done before and after 9 months since the initial procedure. Method(s): This is a longitudinal study of second-look tympanomastoidectomies performed at a tertiary-care center between 2002 and 2010. Demographic and clinical data was collected prospectively. Statistical analyses were performed to determine whether patient age and time interval between initial and second look procedures correlated with residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Result(s): Seventy-two patients qualified for the study. Residual cholesteatoma was more frequent in children (<15 years) than adults (P = .026, Fisher exact test). There was a tendency for recurrent cholesteatoma to occur more frequently in adults than in children. Recurrences tended to occur more frequently in cases with larger canal wall defects. The time interval between the primary and revision surgery did not influence the rate of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Conclusion(s): Younger patients have a higher risk of residual cholesteatoma, possibly secondary to more technically challenging anatomy and surgeon preference to maintain an intact canal wall. Time between primary and revision surgery could be abbreviated or prolonged, since this interval did not influence residual and recurrent cholesteatoma rates.

T1  - Clinical indications for modified radical mastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: To establish clinically derived indications for modified radical mastoidectomy in the setting of cholesteatoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of 223 patients who underwent 265 operations for cholesteatoma in a single tertiary pediatric otolaryngology practice. Clinical characteristics of patients who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy were compared to those who underwent simple mastoidectomy or atticotomy. Result(s): Of the 265 procedures, 10% were modified radical mastoidectomy. Congenital cholesteatoma was more common in the the canal-wall-up group, while recurrent cholesteatoma was more common in those who had a canal-wall-down procedure. The Mills score for those who had a modified radical mastoidectomy was significantly higher than those who underwent canal-wall-up procedures (4.9 vs 3.2, P < .05). Furthermore, extremely poorly pneumatized mastoids and facial nerve dehiscence were both more common in the group who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy. Conclusion(s): Posterior wall preservation or reconstruction is possible in the large majority of cases. Severity of Mills score correlated well with the need for a canal-wall-down procedure. This was further reflected by the fact that this group had a higher incidence of facial nerve dehiscence due to cholesteatoma.

T1  - Inner ear effects of canal wall down mastoidectomy: A prospective study
AB  - Objective: Evaluate the inner ear effects of canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy in the treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) in regard to bone conduction hearing and reported tinnitus and dizziness related disability. Method(s): Prospective study of 86 consecutive patients treated by CWD mastoidectomy for COM with or without cholesteatoma. Patients underwent preoperative audiogram and completion of 2 surveys: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), which were repeated 4 to 6 months postoperatively. Result(s): No significant change in bone-conduction hearing scores occurred postoperatively. DHI and THI scores improved in the vast majority of patients. Thirteen patients, 13 out of 34 (38%), had DHI improvement greater than 18 points, indicating a significant patient-perceived improvement in dizzinessrelated disability. Sixteen patients, 16 out of 43 (37%), had THI improvement greater than 20 points, indicating a significant patient-perceived improvement in tinnitus-related disability. Three patients developed new-onset postoperative dizziness, and 5 patients developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus. The odds ratio for improving DHI and THI scores relative to or worsening scores is 6.6 in DHI (95% CI: 1.8 to 25.0) and 4.2 in THI (95% CI: 1.45 to 12.2). Conclusion(s): Canal wall down mastoidectomy did not result in new-onset sensorineural hearing loss. In addition, using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory measures, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.

T1  - Prospective evaluation of ear and hearing status after cholesteatoma surgery in children
AB  - Introduction: The goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to achieve a safe ear, a dry ear, and to restore hearing as much as possible, while minimizing the number of surgeries. Aim(s): To evaluate long-term hearing status of patients undergoing cholesteatoma surgery in a referral otologic center. Design(s): Prospective data was collected from 43 consecutive pediatric cholesteatoma surgeries, for which complete audiometric follow up data for both ears was available. Result(s): Canal wall up mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (CWU) was performed in 16 children, 100% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 34/12.4. Canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWD) was performed in 27 children, 75% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 62.1/22.2 dB. Discussion(s): Post operative hearing loss should be taken care of as soon as possible, and it should include conventional hearing aids fitting, soft band BAHA or implantable BAHA as the standard of care. When BAHA is not a realistic rehabilitation option (patient or family refusal) a round window vibrant sound bridge (VSB) implantation should be considered.

T1  - [Clinical application of facial nerve monitoring in canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty]. [Chinese]
AB  - To study the neuroprotective effect of facial nerve monitoring in canal wall down of mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty. Twenty cases of chronic suppurative otitis media were performed canal wall down of mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty under general anesthesia. Facial nerve monitoring was used during surgery to locate the facial nerve. Threshold level of kinetic current and amplitude of synchronous reaction were recorded. Seven cases with cholesteatoma were found facial nerve partial exposured in tympanic segment or mastoid segment. 13 cases had integrated facial never canal. Synchronous myopotential response of facial nerve was evoked successfully in all cases. Electroshock threshold had significant difference between facial nerve exposed group and non-exposed group (P<0.01). No facial palsy were found in all cases. Facial nerve monitoring is benefit in locating facial nerve in canal wall down of mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty and could avoid facial nerve injury during surgery.

T1  - An early mastoid cavity epithelialization technique using a postauricular pedicle periosteal flap for canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - Conclusions: Most ears that were treated with a new surgical method were rendered dry and safe, with cavity problems minimized by this simple technique. This technique is also valid in terms of medical economy because it shortens the hospitalization period and subsequent outpatient care is not required frequently. Objective(s): Canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy was a well established procedure for severe chronic otitis media, especially cholesteatoma. However, this procedure has some defects, so-called cavity problems, caused by non-epithelialized bony wall. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early epithelialized technique for the surface of widely formed external acoustic meatus after canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy. Method(s): Twenty-five patients who had been diagnosed with cholesteatoma were divided into two groups. Group I consisted of 15 patients who underwent a new method in which the open cavity was lined with a pedicle periosteal flap of the postauricular region together with free temporal fascia grafts. As a control, 10 patients in group II underwent the standard operation that uses only free temporal fascia grafts. Result(s): A comparison of the two groups showed that it took only 1 month on average for the entire surface of the external auditory meatus of the patients in group I to epithelialize and dry up perfectly, although the same area in all the patients in group II was not dried up perfectly until over 80 days.

T1  - Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chips and a bony attic strut in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine whether autologous bone chips are suitable materials for canal wall reconstruction after cholesteatoma removal and to evaluate the eVectiveness of a separate attic bone graft for the prevention or recurrent cholesteatomas using prospective study of two consecutive patient series (29/31 unselected patients with an average follow-up of 36.3 +/- 11.1/21.5 +/- 6.3 months) and retrograde resection of the posterior-superior canal wall followed by reconstruction of the canal defect using one or more temporal squama bone chips. In the second series, lateral attic wall reconstruction and pars flaccida reinforcement was established by a notched bony attic strut attached onto the neck and short process of the malleus for structural support. In the Wrst series, the rate of recurrent cholesteatomas (17.3%), in particular of attic retraction pockets (31%), was significantly high. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 6.4 +/- 6.3 dB in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 8.7 +/- 3.4 dB in type-III TP with intact stapes suprastructure, and 16.4 +/- 9.3 dB in type-III TP with TORP, respectively. In the second series, recurrent cholesteatoma and retraction pocket rate could be decreased to 9.7 and 6.5%, respectively. The postoperative air-bone gap was 7.5 +/- 5.1 dB HL in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 11.6 +/- 4.9 dB HL in type-III (PORP) TP, and 17.9 +/-12.2 dB HL in type-III (TORP) TP. Connecting the attic strut to the malleus neck did not aVect the malleus mobility and hearing outcome. Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chip reconstruction enables a tailor-made anatomical and physiological reconstitution of the auditory ear canal, thus enhancing the acoustic properties. Precise reconstruction of the lateral attic wall and reinforcement of the superior part of the tympanic membrane seems to be important for the prevention of retraction pockets and subsequent recurrent cholesteatoma development.

T1  - Results of primary ossiculoplasty and prognostic factors in canal wall-down tympanoplasty
AB  - The ideal goals of chronic middle ear surgery should be the permanent removal of disease and the preservation of good hearing function. The postoperative outcome of hearing and the status of middle ear after canal wall-down tympanoplasty with primary ossiculoplasty were studied in 192 ears with chronic middle ear disease. Cholesteatoma was present in 121 (63.0%) of 192 cases; in the remaining 71 cases (27.0%), there was middle ear mucosa disease without cholesteatoma. The stapes superstructure was present in 142 (73.9%) of 192 cases. The results of preoperative and postoperative pure-tone averages were 55.12 (SD, 4.92) and 35.81 (SD, 4.84) dB, respectively. The preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps in 192 cases were 32.70 (SD, 5.18) and 21.16 (SD, 5.09) dB, respectively. The mean hearing gain of the 192 ears was 19.17 (SD, 6.09) dB. The presence of stapes superstructure positively affects hearing status. Also, better hearing results were obtained in cholesteatoma cases presented. Recurrences of disease were seen rarely compared with literature. It was revealed that the postoperative outcome of primary canal wall-down tympanoplasty with ossicular chain reconstruction is suitable for safe ear and hearing ear.

T1  - Pediatric otogenic intracranial abscesses
AB  - Objective: To describe the presentation and management of otogenic intracranial abscesses in a tertiary care pediatric hospital. Study Design: Case series and chart review. Setting(s): Tertiary care pediatric hospital. Subjects and Methods: An inpatient database was queried for the following diagnostic codes from 2000 to 2008: [383.2] petrositis, [383] acute mastoiditis, [386.3] labyrinthitis, [351.0] facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), [351.9] facial nerve disorder unspecified, [351.8] other facial nerve disorders, [383.01] subperiosteal abscess, [383.02] Gradenigo's syndrome, [320] meningitis, [324.9] extradural or subdural abscess, [324.0] intracranial abscess, [325] thrombosis of intracranial venous sinus, and [348.2] otic hydrocephalus. Presenting signs and symptoms, microbiology, length of stay, surgical findings, and outcomes were recorded for each patient. Result(s): Forty patients were identified with an otogenic intracranial complication. Thirty patients had evidence of an intraparenchymal, epidural, subdural, or petrous apex suppurative complication of otitis media. Twenty-four of 30 (80%) patients had a canal wall up mastoidectomy, three (10%) patients had a craniotomy without a mastoidectomy, and three (10%) patients were managed with intravenous antibiotics with or without pressure equalization tubes. There were no mortalities in this series of patients. Conclusion(s): Patients with intracranial abscesses, in selected cases, can be managed with intravenous antibiotics without mastoidectomy. The use of canal wall up mastoidectomy is an acceptable alternative to radical mastoidectomy when surgical intervention is necessary.

T1  - Residual recurrence following staged canal wall up tympanoplasty for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Objectives: Residual recurrence is a critical issue in canal wall up tympanoplasty for middle ear cholesteatoma. Staged procedures are employed when the residual lesion is suspected at the primary surgery. However, there are few reports that describe how frequently and where the residual recurrence occurs following staged procedures. We demonstrate the residual recurrence in our 10 year experience. Study design: Retrospective study. Method(s): Between 1998 and 2007, 94 of the 184 ears with cholesteatoma were operated on using planned staged procedures. Postoperative managements including microscopic, oto-endoscopic, audiometric examinations were performed once per 4 to 6 months. Computed tomography (CT) was performed annually till at least five years postoperatively. Result(s): In the follow-up period there were 4 residual recurrent cases (4.3%; 4/94), although no recurrent case caused by retraction pocket was seen. 3 of the 4 recurrent cases were diagnosed with CT, and the recurrent lesions were indicated as a cystic mass in the epitympanum, facial canal or tegmen plate. They were all school boys under 15. A localized transmastoid removal was performed. Residual diseases in the 3 cases arose from the same place as having been identified and removed at the secondstage operation. Conclusion(s): Residual recurrence is not rare in canal wall up tympanoplasty even though staged procedures are employed. It occurred more frequently in boys. In our limited experience, it is a considerable issue that the residual disease may have arisen from remnants that have been removed at the second-stage operation.

T1  - Surgical findings in revision radical mastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: To assess the intra-operative findings and the long-term results of 91 revision surgeries performed for failure after cholesteatoma surgery. Design(s): Retrospective study. Setting(s): King Abdul-Aziz University hospital, (KAUH). Method(s): The medical records of ninety-one patients who had undergone mastoidectomy revision operations over 10 years period were reviewed, and the data were extracted and analyzed. The indications for revision were recurrent cholesteatoma and persistent otorrhea. Result(s): Ninety-one patients were included in the study; twenty-nine were females and sixty-two were males, ages ranged from 6 to 63 years. Revision mastoidectomies were performed in canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomies. Sixty-six (72.5%) had recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, 61 (67%) had narrow external canal and 44 (48.35%) had high facial ridge. Infected not exenterated mastoid air cells were found in 49 patients (53.8%), involving closed supratubal recess in 26 (53%), persistent sinodural angle air cells and persistent mastoid apex air cells in 13 (26.5%) and persistent tegmental air cells in 10 (20.4%). After an average of 10 years follow up of revision mastoidectomy, 79 (87%) cases had dry and healed cavities. Conclusion(s): Incomplete removal of infected mastoid air cells and incomplete aeration of the mastoid cavities are the most important factors in failure of the primary surgery. Successful CWD mastoidectomy requires removal of all diseased air cells.

T1  - Follow-up of middle-ear cholesteatoma surgery: Canal wall up versus canal wall down tympanoplasty
AB  - Introduction: The ideal goals of cholesteatoma surgery should be the permanent removal of disease and the preservation of good hearing function. There are no universally accepted opinions about the choise of surgical technique and autcome of surgery for cholesteatoma in different age group and localization. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we presented the results of 92 patients (49 males, 43 females; mean age 32 years; range 7 to 56 years) who underwent functional surgical techniques for cholesteatoma between January 2001 and January 2006. An open technique was prefered in 72% of the cases. All the patients were followed-up for at last three years. Result(s): The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techinque were 18% and 9% respectively. In all cases it was evidenced the positive effect of the stapes superstructure on hearing results. Conclusion(s): The age the patients and localization of cholesteatoma are very important factors than determinate the type of surgical procedure and the results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. A closed technique is better for younger children and for attic and sinus cholesteatoma, while in all other cases, an open technique seems more appropriate. Open technique is associated with very law incidences of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in the majority of patients. The presence of stapes superstructure positively affects hearing status indipendently for the technique used.

T1  - Modification of surgical procedures of type 1 tympanoplasty for non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media
AB  - Objective: To introduce our modified procedures of type 1 tympanoplasty and to assess their efficacy. Method(s): We modified the surgical procedures of type 1 tympanoplasty and have used these procedures since September 1999. The modified points are enlargement of the facial recess approach, no elevation of the posterior meatal skin and the tympanic annulus, and endoaural repair of tympanic membrane perforation. 51 patients with simple chronic otitis media have undergone this modified type 1 tympanoplasty. Postoperative hearing was evaluated according to the criteria proposed by the Otological Society of Japan. Result(s): The average follow-up period was 15 months (range 6-35). The hearing result was considered successful when the postoperative hearing level satisfied with at least one of three conditions as follows: (1) air-bone gap <15 dB, (2) hearing gain >15 dB, or (3) hearing level >30 dB. The success rate was 94.1%. The average postoperative air-bone gap, hearing gain and hearing level were 3.9, 10.0 and 29.3 dB, respectively. Conclusion(s): Our modified tympanoplasty is useful to achieve better postoperative hearing results. Copyright Â© 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel.

T1  - Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique: A long-term study of results
AB  - Objective: To report the long-term results of epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique. Subjects and Methods: Two hundred adult cases had undergone epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration from December 1994 to May 2003. The mean postoperative observation period was 91 months, with a minimum of five years. Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique has four major procedures: the widening of the external auditory canal and removal of the scutum; preservation of the posterior canal wall; epitympanoplasty; and mastoid obliteration. We examined postoperative complications and hearing outcomes. Result(s): There was no retraction pocket formation and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity was seen in 10 cases (5%) and three cases were seen in the mastoid cavity (1.5%). Other complications were otorrhea (15 cases), perforation (8 cases), material extrusion (6 cases), and posterior auricular infection (4 cases). The average preoperative pure tone air-bone gap, postoperative pure tone air-bone gap, and air-bone gap closure were 31.5 +/- 12.4 dB, 25.3 +/- 12.2 dB, and 6.2 +/- 12.6 dB, respectively. There were significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative values (P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): The authors believe that epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique can combine the advantages of canal wall down and canal wall up techniques while improving their shortcomings.

T1  - The functional and anatomical results of the canal wall down tympanoplasty in extensive cholesteatoma
AB  - Conclusion: Although we have shown that malleus handle and mucosal factors were important prognostic factors for hearing, we were unable to show the positive effect of the stapes superstructure on hearing results. The positive effect of the presence of the stapes superstructure on hearing results is closely related to the quality of the mucosa. Objective(s): The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ossicular and mucosal factors on hearing in primary canal wall down (CWD) surgery with ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) performed for extensive acquired cholesteatoma. Patients and Methods: A total of 134 adults who had CWD surgery with OCR for extensive acquired cholesteatoma between January 1996 and May 2007 were retrospectively analyzed. Result(s): The graft insufficiency was 13%, chronic infection without cholesteatoma was 6% and cholesteatoma recurrence was 8% after the first operations. The rate of anatomic failure was 10% after a follow-up period of 46.3 months. In this study, we present the anatomic results for 136 ears and functional results for 135 ears. The hearing gain was significantly higher in the cholesteatoma-only group when compared with the mucosalcholesteatoma disease group. Forty-three ears (54%) in the cholesteatoma-only group and 23 ears (42%) in the mucosalcholesteatoma disease group had postoperative ABG within 20 dB. The best hearing results were obtained in Austin group B, while the worst hearing results were evident in Austin group C (p=0.017). Postoperative ABG was within 20 dB in 44% (n=31) of the patients with an intact stapes superstructure, while this ratio was 54% (n=35) when the stapes superstructure was absent.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Planned second-look tympanotomy
AB  - Objective: To review the outcome following surgery for cholesteatoma/ retraction pocket disease where second-look tympanotomy was recommended for selected patients. Design(s): Retrospective outcome analysis following canal wall down mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma/retraction pocket disease. Subjects: The study included 158 patients (163 ears) operated on between 1993 and 2003. Data were collected on the recommendation for second-look tympanotomy, the findings at second-look tympanotomy, and hearing threshold. Result(s): Second-look tympanotomy was recommended for 36 patients, 32 had surgery, and 30 were free of residual disease. The respective mean pre- and postoperative bone conduction threshold was 8.9 dB and 18 dB for single-stage surgery and 15.8 dB and 16.8 dB for second-look tympanotomy. The mean preoperative air-bone gap (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz) was 27.1 dB for single-stage surgery and 27.9 dB for staged surgery. The 1-year air-bone gap was 24.6 dB and 28.6 dB, respectively. Conclusion(s): Planned second-look tympanotomy demonstrated excellent early disease control and allowed management of the middle ear pathology.

T1  - Ossicular reconstruction: Incus versus universal titanium prosthesis
AB  - Objectives: The main purpose of this study is to compare audiological outcomes of incus reconstruction, Xomed Medtronic universal titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) and total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP). We also compared results based on surgical technique, history of previous surgery, form of the prosthesis head, pathology and frequency. Method(s): A chart review was performed and included reconstructions performed between June 2003 and December 2006. Results were based on air-bone gap and pure tone average. Result(s): Postoperative mean air-bone gap and mean pure tone average are significantly lower using incus reconstruction compared with the titanium prosthesis groups. PORP and TORP groups yielded similar outcomes. Closure of ABG is similar in all three groups. Postoperative results were better using an intact canal wall mastoidectomy compared with a canal wall down technique, but ABG closure was similar in both groups. Primary surgeries gave better results than revisions of reconstructions performed by the senior author or elsewhere. Conclusion(s): Though Xomed Medtronic titanium prostheses are effective in ossicular reconstruction, incus reconstruction is at least as effective when feasible. Canal wall down mastoidectomy should be reserved for cases where preservation of the canal wall is contraindicated. Previous same ear surgery is a poor prognostic factor for successful outcome. Preliminary results indicate that round head PORPs may be superior to their oval head counterparts. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - [The short-term efficacy of autogenous bone pate and palva graft for obliterating huge mastoid cavity in canal wall-down approach]. [Chinese]
AB  - To observe the short-term efficacy of autogenous bone pate and Palva graft for obliterating huge remnant mastoid cavity in canal wall down approach. Retrospective analysis clinical data of twenty-one cholesteatomatous cases operated by one surgeon from 2004 to 2007. In twelve cases, simultaneous III type tympanoplasty (Sheehy, P. O. P) was performed. Other 9 cases had undergone mastoidectomy elsewhere before the admission. Six of them were still draining with huge remnant mastoid cavity, and the rest three patients had relapsed cholesteatomas with intermittent draining and huge mastoid cavity. Normal saline solution perfusion was used to measure the volume of remnant mastoid cavity. The criterion of huge remnant mastoid cavity is more than 8 ml. Of twelve primary cases with III type tympanoplasty, 11 patients maintained a small, dry, and healthy mastoid cavity after twenty-seven days. The average increase of hearing level of them was 17.5dB, and the air-bone gap is less than 20 dB. Of one patient, bone pate was infected and was discharged. A dry mastoid cavity was achieved until fifty-five days after surgery. The patient is keeping a big air-bone gap caused by displacement of ossicle chain prosthesis. Just eighteen days later, other nine cases of revision mastoidectomy achieved a small, dry, and healthy mastoid cavity, with lightly improved hearing level. Obliteration of a canal wall down huge mastoid cavity by Palva graft with autologous bone pate is a reliable and effective technique that results in a small, dry, low-maintenance mastoid cavity. The short-term efficacy of simultaneous III tympanoplasty is satisfactory if patient selection is suitable.

T1  - [Cholesteatoma otitis media and supratubal recess]. [Chinese]
AB  - To study the significance of supratubal recess and its aeration pathway to epitympanum in the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma otitis media. Fifty-two ears of cholesteatoma were selected as study group. Sixteen ears of traumatic facial palsy with pneumatic mastoid, which had no history of chronic otitis media were selected as control group. The status of supratubal recesses of all and their aeration pathways to epitympanum were observed in operations. Sixteen ears from control group clearly presented supratubal recesses. Membrane closure was founded in four of them. The aeration pathways of fifty-two ears (100%) from study group were all completely closed. Comparing with control group, the difference was obviously significant (chi2 = 41.7144, P = 0.000). Among these cases, bony closure was observed in thirty-four ears (65.4%), while membrane closure in eighteen ears (34.6%). Their epitympanum space was very narrow and mastoid was sclerotic or poorly developed. Blockage of the aeration pathway between supratubal recess and epitympanum was possible one of the origins of negative-pressure status of epitympanum and mastoid, which might lead to the formation of aural cholesteatoma. Anatomy variation of the aeration pathway from supratubal recess to epitympanum might be a pathogenesis factor of cholesteatoma otitis media. It suggested that opening the aeration pathway in tympanoplasty with intact canal wall up technique might be helpful to prevent recurrence of aural cholesteatoma.

T1  - A new technique in cholesteatoma surgery: CHAT. [Turkish]
AB  - Objectives: Patients with extended cholesteatoma who underwent Combined Heermann And Tos (CHAT) technique, which we developed depending on our studies on Heermann's "cartilage palisade tympanoplasty" and Tos' "modified combined approach tympanoplasty", were analyzed. Patients and Methods: The study included 37 ears of 35 patients, in whom CHAT technique was performed. Posterior-superior bony annulus was widely drilled, transmeatal atticotomy and cortical mastoidectomy with preservation of posterior ear canal wall were performed in each patient. After ossiculoplasty, perforation of the eardrum, opening at bony annulus and scutum were reconstructed with the palisade technique. At the final evaluation, otoscopic and audiologic findings were evaluated and compared (Paired Sample t-test). Result(s): Median age was 33 (6-57), mean follow-up period was 30 months (range: 6-60; standard deviation: 19). There was no complication in any patient before or after the surgery. There was two (5%) recurrent cholesteatomas (eradication: 95%), one of which was local. The mean hearing and air-bone gap preoperatively versus in last evaluation were 45 (standard deviation: 14) vs 35 dB (standard deviation: 16) (p<0.0001) and 29 (standard deviation: 11) vs 21 dB (standard deviation: 11), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion(s): We conclude that CHAT technique is quite successful in the eradication of extensive cholesteatoma with satisfactory results in hearing, although it is a one-stage, canal wall up closed technique.

T1  - Management of chronic otitis by middle ear obliteration with blind sac closure of the external auditory canal
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Description of a technique of middle ear obliteration (MEO) with blind sac closure of the external auditory canal with discussion of the indications for its use in cases of recalcitrant chronic otitis and in far advanced disease. PATIENTS: All patients underwent otologic examination and audiologic and radiologic assessments in a quaternary center. RESULT(S): Fifty-three cases of MEO were analyzed. For 9 patients, primary surgery was performed. One case of residual disease was identified. The minimum follow-up was 2 years. CONCLUSION(S): The decision to perform a MEO is one that is made only rarely. However, this is a technique that should be part of every otologist's armamentarium. Whereas the indications for its use are more straightforward in an ear with unserviceable hearing, a MEO is occasionally required in an ear with good cochlear reserve due the severity of disease. All of our patients managed by MEO have had an improvement in their quality of life and a high rate of successful eradication of disease. Â© 2008 Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

T1  - Long-term results following mastoid obliteration in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy. [German]
AB  - Background: The primary goal in chronic otitis media is the creation of a dry, safe ear with hearing preservation and reconstruction. This study was designed to evaluate the authors' experience using autologous bone pate and conchal cartilage for mastoid obliteration in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy. Method(s): A retrospective long-term review in 2003 of thirty-nine ears was performed, which underwent mastoid obliteration in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy between 1993 and 2002 performed by the senior author. Data included questionnaire results, clinical observation as well as pre- and postoperative audiometry. Result(s): Long-term follow-up shows, that 38 out of 39 ears maintained a small, dry, healthy mastoid cavity. Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in a single patient. A self-cleaning mastoid bowl was achieved in 90%, resulting in reduced follow-up visits. Postoperative vertigo in canal wall down revision surgery is clearly diminished due to the mastoid obliteration. Overall, 92% of patients are satisfied with the surgical result. Conclusion(s): Obliteration of a canal wall down mastoid cavity by autologous bone pate and conchal cartilage is a reliable and effective technique that results in a dry, trouble free mastoid cavity in 90% of the patients with chronic otitis media.

T1  - Chronic ear surgery in irradiated temporal bones
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze outcomes of chronic ear surgery in patients with irradiated temporal bones. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. METHOD(S): Fifteen patients who received radiation involving the temporal bone underwent 21 surgical procedures from 1977 to 1997. Intraoperative findings, long-term complications, and hearing outcomes were analyzed. RESULT(S): Over 50% of cases involved abnormal intraoperative findings including facial nerve dehiscence, labyrinthine fistulas, or dural exposure. Audiologic data revealed that these patients suffered from conductive, mixed, and sensorineural hearing loss. Long-term complications included tympanic membrane perforation and recurrent cholesteatoma. All patients had dry, non-draining ears at the end of the study. CONCLUSION(S): Irradiated temporal bones present difficult intraoperative anatomy and often require multiple procedures to cure otologic disease. Although radiation significantly reduces vascularity and hampers healing, vascularized reconstruction flaps are not necessary for good outcomes.

T1  - Chronic ear surgery in patients with syndromes and multiple congenital malformations
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The propensity for the development of chronic ear disease in patients with certain congenital syndromes is well described. Little is known about the efficacy of surgery in the management of such patients. This paper will review an institutional experience with the surgical management of chronic ear disease in patients with congenital syndromes or multiple major malformations associated with high rates of ear disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHOD(S): Charts were reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with either a congenital syndrome or multiple major malformations with a known association with the development of chronic ear disease who underwent ear surgery for chronic ear disease (excluding tympanostomy tube placement). Syndromes encountered, surgeries performed, operative outcomes, complications, and the efficacy of ossicular chain reconstruction is reported. RESULT(S): Forty-three patients with 14 different syndromes or malformations were identified. These patients underwent 66 surgical procedures on 56 ears. Seventy-nine percent of patients had undergone an ear procedure prior to presentation. Disease eradication was achieved in 64% of ears with a single procedure, and 89% of ears were controlled with two surgeries or less. Thirty-two percent of surgeries involved a canal wall down procedure, a rate similar to that seen for all patients in our practice over the past decade. When used, ossicular chain reconstruction significantly reduced the air-bone gap, resulting in hearing improvement. Results for patients with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and conotruncal cardiac abnormalities are discussed. Only minor complications were encountered. CONCLUSION(S): Syndromic patients and those with a major congenital malformation may present with significant chronic ear disease. Appropriate surgical management can yield successful eradication of disease with low complication rates. Â© The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

T1  - Results, hearing rehabilitation, and follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging after tympanomastoid exenteration, obliteration, and external canal overclosure for severe chronic otitis media
AB  - Objectives: We sought to evaluate the results, auditory rehabilitation, and follow-up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after tympanomastoid exenteration with obliteration of the mastoid cavity and overclosure of the external ear canal in patients with severe chronic otitis media that was resistant to medical therapy and conventional surgery and was associated with a profound sensorineural or severe conductive hearing loss. Method(s): Twenty-nine patients were analyzed and underwent this surgical technique. Twelve patients had, during the same or later stage, either cochlear implantation, fixture implantation for a bone-anchored hearing aid, or middle ear implantation. For follow-up control of the obliterated cavity, delayed gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted MRI in combination with non-echo planar imaging diffusion weighted sequences were used. Result(s): No patient had recurrent otorrhea after an average follow-up period of 4.75 years. One patient had a residual cholesteatoma as shown by new MRI techniques, and this was successfully resected. One patient developed complications 6 months after 1-stage tympanomastoid exenteration and cochlear implantation. Conclusion(s): This technique is very useful in selected patients with severe chronic otitis media that is resistant to medical therapy and surgery and is associated with a profound sensorineural or severe conductive hearing loss. New sequences in MRI are used for postoperative follow-up of these obliterated cavities and seem reliable for the detection of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Middle ear implantation and cochlear implantation can be relatively safely performed in these patients in a second stage. Â© 2007 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

T1  - Improvements to staged canal wall up tympanoplasty for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: To describe our improvements to staged canal wall up tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy (SCUT) for middle ear cholesteatoma, and to show more successful outcomes of the surgery compared with our data previously reported. Study Design: Retrospective study in a tertiary referral hospital. Setting(s): 78 ears of 76 patients with extensive cholesteatoma were operated on using the improved SCUT between July 1998 and December 2006. Improved SCUT included new techniques such as scutum plasty and mastoid cortex plasty performed in a staged manner. Result(s): Only 2 ears showed retraction pocket formation (7.7%) without recurrence in 26 ears followed for more than 5 years. In 48 followed for more than 3 years, frequency of postoperative retraction pocket formation (5/48; 10.4%) was significantly lower compared to our previous results (41/134; 30.6%, P < 0.01). Conclusion(s): Our improvements to SCUT contributed to the decreasing of frequency of postoperative retraction pocket that may lead to cholesteatoma recurrence, although a longer follow-up study is required.

T1  - Surgery in cholesteatoma: Ten years follow-up
AB  - Background: During last decades, many otologists attempted to make a long standing dry ear, resulting in better hearing after cholesteatoma surgery. This study evaluated the prognosis of two common methods of cholesteatoma ear surgery considering ten years follow-up. Method(s): This retrospective analysis was done using medical records of 108 adult patients with cholesteatoma. After ten years of operation, in these patients we compared the results of the two major trends of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD). Result(s): Among these patients, 72 (67%) and 36 (33%) underwent the CWD and CWU method respectively. During follow-up, 8% of patients with CWD and 21% of those with CWU had undergone at least one revision operations. Ten yrs after primary surgery, 93% of the ears were dry, 90% with intact tympanic membrane, with 42% of CWD and 52% of CWU groups having fair hearing. One deaf individual was found in each group. The recurrence rate was reported in 6% of CWD and 17% CWU patients, and independent of the size of cholesteatoma, mastoid status or foot plate erosion. The major predisposing factors for recurrence were retraction and discharge, especially in combination. Intact tympanic membrane was more frequent in CWD group, although there was no significant difference between the recurrence rates of these two groups. Conclusion(s): The result of this study indicated a need for improving surgical techniques in order to lower the recurrence rate and improvement of hearing, especially with the help of endoscopes.

T1  - Tympanoplasty in our department - Treatment of the posterior meatal wall. [Japanese]
AB  - Canal wall up tympanoplasty is considered an ideal method because of its effective preservation of the meatal morphology with early drying and aroidance of disorder in the mastoid cavity after surgery. However, since the posterior meatal wall is preserved in this method, a blind spot in the surgical field may result in a higher incidence of residual cholesteatoma than canal wall down tympanoplasty. There is a risk of retraction cholesteatoma recurrence in spaces of the reconstructed external auditory canal in patients in whom pneumatization in the mastoid wall down cavity has not been achieved. To solve these problems, the usefulness of mastoid obliteration tympanoplasty has been reported, and reconstruction of the posterior meatal wall using soft tissues has been also reported. In this study, we evaluated the problems of reconstructing the external auditory canal using soft materials based on the experience and outcomes of patients with cholesteatoma treated by this method since 1999 after the method was carefully evaluated.

T1  - Clinical evaluation of middle ear cholesteatoma. [Japanese]
AB  - We evaluated hearing improvement of 81 cases who underwent surgical treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma between July 1997 and December 2003. The post-operative follow-up periods were no less than 6 months after final ossicular reconstruction in all cases. We classified surgical results to be successful when the postoperative hearing level met at least one of three conditions: 1) air-bone gap was less than 20 dB, 2) hearing levels were above 30 dB, or 3) hearing gain was more than 15 dB according to the guidelines in middle ear and mastoid surgery (Otology Japan 11, 2001). In most cases, the canal wall down method with canal reconstruction was employed and autologaus auricular cartilage was used for ossicular reconstruction. The overall success rate was 74% (60 out of 81 cases). Single staged tympanoplasty was performed in 39 cases and the success rate was 69% (27 out of 39 cases). Programmed staged tympanoplasty was performed in 42 cases and the success rate was 78% (33 out of 42 cases). Tympanoplasty type III was most frequently employed for ossicular chain reconstruction and the success rate was 85%.

T1  - Tragal perichondrium and cartilage in reconstructive tympanoplasty
AB  - The objective of study was to assess the efficacy of tragal perichondrium and cartilage, the functional capacity in restoring hearing acuity, it's mechanical survival, it's extrusion rate and it's functional integrity in tympanomastoid reconstruction. The study was conducted at K.E.M. Hospital, ENT department during 1980 to 2000. The study presents six hundred ear operations of varied middle ear pathology using tragal cartilage and perichondrium as a choice graft. The technical advantages of tragal perichondrium graft in myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty, osseusplasty, and mastoid cavity obliteration are discussed. We have recorded our observations and results and concluded that tragal perichondrium and cartilage is an ideal graft material for reconstructive tympanoplasty.

T1  - Cholesteatoma and fistula of bone labyrinth. [Czech]
AB  - The authors evaluate seven patients with fistula of labyrinth, which were verified during 220 operations on patients with chronic middle ear inflammations with cholesteatoma at the ORL Department of Regional Hospital Pardubice from July 1997 till December 2002. Three patients suffered from vertigo already before the operation and two of them had even a positive fistula symptom; four patients were without vertigo. Two patients were deaf before the operation and one other patient had a partial facial nerve paralysis. The therapy consisted in sanation (treatment) of the inflammation by the open technique with removal of the posterior wall of ear canal (canal wall down) and removal of the cholesteatoma matrix from the fistula. The fistula was detected six times on the lateral and once on the superior semicircular canal. In two patients, intracranial complications were diagnosed (subperiostal abscess in one patient and in second one pachymeningitis with periphlebitis of the sigmoid sinus). In five patients with preserved hearing before the operation, the hearing remained unchanged after the operation, air conduction decreased in one, improved air and bone conduction improved in another patient and a deterioration of the conductive and perception components of hearing deteriorated in the other patient. The paralysis of facial nerve diagnosed in one patient before the therapy improved after the operation. The authors discuss present opinions on the pathophysiology of the origin of fistula on the basis of destruction of the labyrinth bone wall due to chronic middle ear inflammation, the way of performing of the fistula test and its diagnostic contribution, the classification and staging of the labyrinth fistula and the tactics of therapy.

T1  - Management of brain herniation and cerebrospinal fluid leak in revision chronic ear surgery
AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Brain herniation and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage into the middle ear and mastoid are rare but described complications of chronic ear disease. This paper will discuss the presentation and management of brain herniation and/or CSF leak encountered in revision chronic ear surgery. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Method(s): Twelve of 1,130 cases of revision chronic ear surgery in which brain herniation or CSF leak was diagnosed were identified and analyzed. Result(s): Ten (83%) patients' initial diagnosis was tympanic membrane (TM) perforation with cholesteatoma and two (17%) with TM perforation without cholesteatoma. Initial revision procedures included one (8.3%) tympanoplasty with canal-wall-up mastoidectomy maintaining ossicular continuity, two (17%) tympanoplasties with canal-wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomies with ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR), and nine (75%) tympanoplasties with CWD mastoidectomies without OCR. Three (25%) required a second procedure, two (17%) a third, and one (8.3%) a fourth, finally resulting in four (33%) with an ossicular reconstruction and eight (67%) without. Brain herniation and/or CSF leak were repaired by way of transmastoid and middle fossa approaches. Preoperative and postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gaps were statistically similar (33.1 and 28.1 dbHL, respectively; P = .464), Conclusion(s): Brain herniation and/or CSF leak appear to be rare complications of surgery for revision chronic ear disease. Their management require adherence to the principles of establishing a safe ear with hearing restoration as a secondary goal.

T1  - Middle ear hearing restoration using autologus cartilage graft in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - In the chronic otitis media, the primary goal of surgeon is always to eradicate the disease from middle ear. Attention to hearing restoration and ossicular continuity is secondary. The role of Canal Wall Down and Intact Canal mastoidectomy in treatment of chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma remains debated. This present study combines the role of Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomies only whether performed in past or single stage procedure with reconstruction of hearing mechanisms using autograft cartilage prosthesis in various situations of ossicular chain status that surgeon may encounter during tympanoplasty procedures. The results of such procedures are being discussed in this paper.

T1  - Appropriate standard for surgery of pars flaccid cholesteatoma. [Japanese]
AB  - Our choice of surgery for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is based on two fundamental principles: 1) the physiological morphology and function should be preserved to the maximum extent possible postoperatively, i.e., the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus and mucosa of the middle ear cavity should be well preserved; 2) the surgical procedure is selected based on the extent of invasion and the morbidity associated with the cholesteatoma, including the status of the remaining mucosa of the middle ear cavity. The subjects registered for this study, which was conducted to collect evidence to establish the standards for selection of the surgical procedure, were patients who had undergone initial surgery for cholesteatoma of the pars flaccid type at our department during the 15-year period from 1988 to 2003. The postoperative recurrent rate and improvement of hearing were analyzed in these. The standards for selection of the surgical procedure according to the morbid condition were established in 1996, based in particular, on the postoperative recurrent rate of cholesteatoma during the 8-year period from 1988 to 1995. The 15-year period from 1988 to 2003 was divided into the former half (8-year period) and the latter half (7-year period), with 1996 as the cutoff year. The recurrent rate (after one-stage conservative surgery for the posterior wall, i.e., canal wall-up) and improvement of hearing were compared between these two periods. The recurrent rate was distinctly lower following surgery during the latter period. The hearing was favorably improved for both periods. The results suggest improved surgical skills, decreased severity of inflammation, and the validity of the standards established in 1996 for selection of the surgical procedure.

T1  - Management of cholesteatomatous labyrinthine fistulae on 22 cases. [French]
AB  - Objective: To study the incidence, location, pre- and postoperative symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, facial palsy), preoperative diagnostic imaging, and surgical treatment of labyrinthine fistulae (LF). Design(s): Retrospective case review. Patient(s): Twenty-two cases of LF over 382 mastoid operations performed in a 168-month period. Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical, imaging, and surgical correlation of extensive fistulae and bone fistulae. Result(s): LF prevalence was 5.8%. The main primary symptoms were otorrhea and hypoacusis. Only four patients presented vertigo as their main complaint. All patients underwent preoperative computed tomographic (CT) scans and preoperative audiometry. LF diagnosis was made before surgery for 100% of patients on the basis of CT scan. A second fistula was, however, misdiagnosed by imaging in two patients. With respect to surgical technique, a canal wall down procedure was performed in 77% and a conservative procedure was performed in 23%. Fistula was located in the horizontal semicircular canal in 100% of cases, and in 9%, a second fistula was operatively diagnosed. In 91% of cases, the matrix was removed, whereas it was left in the course of a canal down procedure in 9%. With a follow-up of 5.7 years, hearing remained unchanged in 80% of patients. Conclusion(s): Surgery with removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and sealing of the fistula with temporalis fascia is a safe procedure that can help preserve cochlear function. The choice of a canal down procedure would be influenced by cholesteatoma characteristics rather than by the finding of an LF.

T1  - The application of mastoid obliteration with homograft tooth in open method tympanoplasty. [Chinese]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of open method tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration with homograft tooth and reconstruction of the attic wall. METHOD(S): Fifty-two cases with cholesteatoma or skeletal ulcer otitis media were performed the open method tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration with homograft tooth and reconstruction of the attic wall after radical mastoidectomy. RESULT(S): External auditory canals of 48 patients were normal in appearance. The transplanted membrane in 46 ears was survived. The dry-ears rate was 92.31% and the average time waited till dry-ears was 17.56 +/- 4.16 days. The air-conducting hearing levels of average language frequency have been enhanced over 15 dB HL in 41 ears. An air-bone gap of less than 20 dB HL was achieved in 31 ears. CONCLUSION(S): The open method tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration with homograft tooth and reconstruction of the attic wall can recovery the anatomic structure and physiological function of external auditory canal and middle ear better. The long-term effect on improving hearing was significant.

T1  - Using high resolution computed tomography to evaluate middle ear cleft aeration of postoperative cholesteatoma ears
AB  - Background. Middle ear cleft mucosa and mastoid air cells are important for middle ear cleft aeration. However, the postoperative cholesteatoma ears treated in traditional open or closed techniques are often complicated by an atelectatic condition. In order to preserve the healthy mastoid air cells and also eradicate the cholesteatoma completely, we treated cholesteatoma ears by "tailored mastoidectomy with cartilage obliteration of the open cavity." Methods. We used high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to evaluate middle ear cleft aeration of postoperative cholesteatoma ears. Statistical analysis were used to investigate the correlation between postoperative milddle ear cleft aeration and associated clinical factors such as middle ear mucosa condition found intraoperatively (intact or defective), stage of cholesteatoma, level of mastoid pneumatization, range of cartilage obliteration, and tympanoplasty type. Results. Forty-four cholesteatoma ears of forty-three patients (aged 13 to 74 years) underwent tailored mastoidectomy with cartilage obliteration of the open cavity from 1988 to 1998. Aeration of the middle ear cleft was evaluated using HRCT performed in a mean of 6.77 years after surgery. There was no aeration in 10 ears (22.7%), aeration only in the tympanic cavity in 19 ears (43.2%), and aeration in both the tympanic and mastoid cavities in 15 ears (34.1%). There were 26 ears (59.1%) with intact and healthy mucosa and 18 ears (40.9%) with defective mucosa. The correlation between the mucosal condition and recovery of middle ear cleft aeration was significant (r = 0.6855, p < 0.001). Recovery of aeration was negatively correlated with the stage of cholesteatoma (r = -0.4951, p = 0.0156) and positively correlated with the level of postoperative mastoid pneumatization (r = 0.8036, p < 0.001). Conclusions. Preserving healthy middle ear cleft mucosa and uninvolved mastoid air cells during cholesteatoma surgery enables gas-exchange through the remaining mucosa and maintains the pressure buffering effect of the mastoid, both of which are important for recovery of middle ear cleft aeration. HRCT is useful for the postoperative evaluation of middle ear cleft aeration.

T1  - Detection of postoperative residual cholesteatoma with delayed contrast-enhanced MR imaging: Initial findings
AB  - Our objective was to assess the value of delayed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo MR imaging in the detection of residual cholesteatoma in patients who have undergone canal wall-up tympanoplasty procedure. The MR imaging was obtained prior to revision surgery in 18 patients with opacity of the post-operative cavity at CT examination 12-18 months after canal wall-up tympanoplasty. In each patient the following was performed: precontrast T1- and T2-weighted images; and early and delayed contrast-enhanced axial and coronal T1-weighted imaging. Early and delayed MR imaging results were separately compared with surgical second-look findings. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were evaluated for early and delayed post-contrast MR imaging, compared with second-look surgery findings. A residual cholesteatoma was correctly identified in 8 of 9 cases with delayed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging. Mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and inter-observer agreement (evaluated by kappa statistics) were, respectively, 85.2, 92.6, 92.6%, and kappa=0.78 for the delayed contrast-enhanced MR imaging technique. The same parameters were, respectively, 96.3, 33.3, 60.6, and 0.30 for the early contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images. We conclude that delayed contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR imaging is reliable for the detection of residual cholesteatomas of the middle ear in patients who have undergone canal wall-up tympanoplasty.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with Soft Posterior Meatal Wall Reconstruction - Changing the Way of Thinking for Prevention of Retraction Cholesteatoma Recurrence. [Japanese]
AB  - There has been serious controversy regarding the choice of surgical methods for ears with cholesteatoma. I began to perform tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the soft posterior meatal wall for the prevention of postoperative retraction pocket formation in 1989. Our method is characterized by the reconstruction of the soft posterior meatal wall, non-obliteration with permanent or temporary materials, no use of a Palva flap and the use of fibrin glue for attaching the fascia to the posterior meatal skin. None of the patients experienced postoperative narrow-neck retraction pocket formation, and whenever aeration of the middle ear was disturbed, a balloon-like retraction was observed. In this report I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various tympanoplasty methods in comparison with our method based on the requirements for treatment of cholesteatoma. All other methods of tympanoplasty with canal wall up or canal reconstruction are performed based on the idea of fortification of the posterior meatal wall for prevention of retraction pocket recurrence. I changed this way of thinking and as a result could avoid retraction pocket formation. What I would like to present here is not the material for posterior meatal wall reconstruction but a new way of thinking for prevention of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Surgery on the only hearing ear. [Japanese]
AB  - The management of only hearing ears remains controversial because of the risk of postoperative hearing deterioration. On the basis of our recent series of 12 only hearing ears at Hyogo College of Medicine from 1999 to 2002, we reviewed the literature and discussed indications for surgery on only hearing ears. The incidence of only hearing ears was less than 2% of ear surgeries in the literature. They comprised mainly cholesteatoma cases in English papers, and otitis media and cholesteatoma cases in Japanese papers. The causes of profound hearing loss on the contralateral ear were mainly former surgery and otitis media in English papers, and otitis media in Japanese papers. Sensorineural hearing loss was a rare cause in both papers. In our recent series, 7 ears (58. 3%) showed hearing improvement (of more than 15 dB), 4 ears (33. 3%) remained unchanged (change within 10 dB), and 1 ear (8. 3%) showed hearing deterioration (of more than 15 dB), which were better results than those in the previous papers. Our surgical concepts are the following: (1) In cases of chronic otitis media, we first recommend simple underlay myringoplasty, and secondly, tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy. (2) In cases of cholesteatoma, we recommend the canal wall down method, leaving matrix on the fistula. (3) When an only hearing ear shows severe combined hearing loss, we recommend informing the patient of the possible necessity of cochlear implant if hearing deteriorates after surgery. Finally, it is needless to say that skillfull surgeons should perform surgery on only hearing ears after special consideration.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration: Autogenous cranial bone pAte reconstruction
AB  - Objective: To review the outcome in consecutive patients who have undergone complete epitympanic and mastoid obliteration and concurrent tympanic membrane reconstruction over a 53-month period. Study Design: Retrospective review. Setting(s): Tertiary referral center. Patient(s): Sixty-two ears in 56 sequential patients undergoing mastoid obliteration with major indications including recurrent infection, debris trapping in the canal wall-down cavity, intolerance of water exposure, calorically induced vertigo in an existing cavity, a semicircular canal fistula, and inability to wear a hearing device. Thirty-six ears in 33 patients who underwent second-stage surgery for ossicular reconstruction during the same time period are also reviewed. Intervention(s): Transplanted autogenous cranial bone is used to induce osteoneogenesis resulting in complete obliteration of the epitympanic and mastoid spaces while maintaining a mesotympanic space. Main Outcome Measure(s): Success of obliteration, incidence of symptoms prompting intervention, hearing outcome, incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, and incidence of eustachian tube dysfunction necessitating treatment and need for revision surgical procedures. Result(s): Complete take of the bony obliteration occurs in over 95% of cases; 90% of treated patients enjoy complete absence of original symptoms, whereas symptoms improved in the remainder. For over 95% of patients, existing eustachian tube function has been adequate after obliteration. To date, no patient has required revision surgical intervention. Conclusion(s): Mastoid obliteration with autogenous cranial bone is a safe and extremely effective option for treatment of problematic canal wall-down mastoid cavities. Surgical techniques that include sterile harvest of the cranial bone graft mixed with antibiotic, revision of the cavity to expose viable native bone, inclusion of the epitympanic spaces in the obliteration, and complete coverage of the pAte with autogenous fascia have proven critical to successful outcome.

T1  - Periosteo-temporofascial flap for cavity obliteration - First Indian study
AB  - Healing of the mastoid cavitycompletely is the desired result after a mastoid surgery. Even after the Sade's principles of the complete disease clearance, adequate lowering of the facial ridge, good meatoplasty and closure of the perforation of the tympanic membrane are followed, the complete healing of the mastoid cavity is sometimes not the end result. According to various surgeons, the incidence of discharging mastoid cavity after a open cavity mastoid surgery is between 10-60%2,3. The usual techniques of obliteration of the mastoid cavity to decrease the size of the mastoid cavity, unusually has good healing results due to good vascularity. The failure to the early detection of disease recurrence and risk of sudden appearance of intra-cranial complications are the most important disadvantages of the technique. We undertook a study in 50 randomly chosen patients of Unsafe CSOM. Twenty five underwent obliteration of the mastoid cavity with Periosteo-Temporofascial flap, which is based on branches of posterior auricular artery and rest twenty five underwent non-obliteration of the mastoid cavity. The results between the two groups were compared in terms of healing of the mastoid cavity and hearing gain after operation. Very good results in terms of healing of the cavity were seen after obliteration surgery. The rate of healing of the cavity was much faster after obliteration. The additional advantage with the flap is the see-through character of the cavity lining, which would lead to early detection of the disease recurrence. No significant increase in the hearing was seen in the obliterated patients as compared to non-obliterated cases.

T1  - Hearing results of tympanoplasty. [Japanese]
AB  - We retrospectively surveyed 43 ears operated on from April 2000 to March 2002 at St. Marianna University School of Medicine. Surgery success was analyzed using the three criteria suggested by the Japan Clinical Otology Committee in 1999. The procedure was classified as successful when the hearing level 6 months after surgery met at least one of these three conditions: 1) an air-born gap of less than 15dB, 2) a gain of more than 15dB, or 3) a hearing level above 30dB. We used the autograft cartilage for a columella for ossicular reconstruction. Success in all cases was 69.8%. In chronic otitis media, it was 87.5%. In cholesteatoma, it was 56.5%. We found no significant difference in success among canal-wall-down, canal reconstruction with mastoid obliteration and canal-wall-up tympanoplasties. Success was 81.8% for type I tympanoplasty. 70.8% for type III with columella or interposition, and 50.0% for type IV with columella or interposition.

T1  - Bone pate plate for mastoid obliteration in cholesteatoma surgery. [Japanese]
AB  - Canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration for aural cholesteatoma has been performed in our hospital. After complete eradication of a cholesteatoma by canal wall down technique, the dissected bony canal wall is reconstructed and the opened mastoid cavity is obliterated. Recently, we have employed compressed bone dust fixed by a fibrin adhesive as a new material for canal wall reconstruction and mastoid obliteration. At the time of mastoid bone drilling, healthy bone dust called bone pate is collected. The bone pate is rinsed with physiological saline containing antibiotics and then dried. The pate is mixed with a fibrin adhesive and fixed into a plate of about 4 mm thickness. Finally, the plate is compressed into a 2 mm thick bone pate plate. Scissors can cut the compressed plate easily. It is especially useful for reconstruction of the dissected canal wall, mastoid obliteration with bone chips and covering the obliterated mastoid cavity. This new material can achieve a smooth and steady postoperative posterior bony canal. Bone pate plate, which is easy to make and easy to handle, should be a useful reconstructive material in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Histopathological study of transplanted nasal mucosa in cases of operative ear with adhesive otitis media. [Japanese]
AB  - One of the greatest concerns among otologists is the countermeasures agaimst readhesion of the new ear drum after tympanoplasty in adhesive otitis media. We think it is important to facilitate early regeneration of the middle ear mucosa, as well as to assure aeration in the middle ear cavity immediately after operation. For this reason, in patients with ear drum adhesion we attempt to minimize exposure of the middle ear bone surface as much as possible. However, in some patients with extensively exposed bone surface in the middle ear cavity, we transplant mucosa of the inferior turbinate to the bone surface to facilitate epitheliazasion. To investigate the morphological findings of the transplanted inferion turbinate, we obtained biopsy specimens at the second stage operation. From May 1993 to December 2000 we performed nasal mucosa transplantation on 45 cases of the ear with adhesive otitis media: thirty-one cases of cholesteatoma with adhesive otitis media and fourteen cases of postoperative ear (20 males, 25 females). The method of operation was canal wall down typanoplasty with canal reconstruction using auricular cartilage. Usually nasal mucosa grafts are placed on the promontrium. Among the 45 cases, 16 cases were carried out by single-stage surgery and the remaining 29 cases, by staged surgery. Four cases experienced recurrence of adhesion. No recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in al cases during the follow-up period. At the second stage operation, we obtained biopsy specimens of the middle ear mucosa, where the nasal mucosa was transplanted. We investigated the morphological findings of 24 cases; 5 cases could not be investigated because the biopsy speciments were too little. 50% was pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium which is similar to nasal mucosa. Glandular tissue could be seen under the epithelium in 13 out of 24 cases. Among most of the 13 cases, glandular tissur decreased in quantity and atrophic findings could be seen as well. We consider that nasal mucosa adapts to the middle ear environment and survives at a high rate. It is considered that this operative method is useful for preventing the recurrence of adhesion by securing the middle ear cavity.

T1  - Research of the chorda tympani nerve in cholesteatoma. [Chinese]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the ultrastructure of the chorda tympani nerve and analyze the taste and facial nerve functions in patients with cholesteatoma. METHOD(S): 1. The tympanic segments of chorda tympani nerves were collected for ultrastructural investigations in 19 cholesteatoma cases who underwent canal-wall-down tympanoplasty. 2. All these patients received a spatial (regional) taste test preoperatively and postoperatively, respectively. Multiple loci were tested in a given order (front of the tongue, foliate papillae, circumvallate papillae, and soft palate). The solutions used in this study were 1.0 mol/L sodium chloride (salty), 1.0 mol/L sucrose (sweet), 0.032 mol/L citric acid (sour) and 0.001 mol/L quinine hydrochloride (bitter). The analyses of variance was used. 3. House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system was conducted to evaluate the facial nerve function preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULT(S): 1. There were obvious ultrastructural damages in all the chorda tympani nerves, such as swelling (100%), disarrangement (100%), vacuoles formation of myelin (89%), edema of Schwann cells (95%), intracytoplasmic vacuoles in Schwann cell (89%) and proliferation of the collagen tissue (89%). 2. Two patients complained of change of taste after operation. The analyses of variance showed that the taste function of the ipsilateral side of tympanoplasty were not statistically altered for each stimulus at each locus (P > 0.05). 3. No facial palsy occurred postoperatively. CONCLUSION(S): This research suggested that the chorda tympani nerves underwent ultrastructural changes in patients with cholesteatoma. The dissection of chorda tympani nerve would not affect the taste and facial nerve functions.

T1  - Facial nerve paralysis due to chronic otitis media
AB  - Objective: To present the characteristics of facial paralysis caused by chronic otitis media. The role of cholesteatoma, bony dehiscence, the duration of the disease, and the results of surgical therapy in facial paralysis were reviewed. Study Design: Retrospective case review. Setting(s): Tertiary care referral center. Patient(s): A total of 24 patients (6 women, 18 men; age range, 17-74 yr) with facial paralysis were included in the study. Intervention(s): Canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed in 14 patients (58.3%), modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in seven patients (25%), and intact canal wall mastoidectomy was performed in three patients (16.7%). All patients had decompression of the fallopian canal from the geniculate ganglion to the stylomastoid foramen without opening the epineural sheath. Result(s): Eighteen patients (75%) had gradual onset of facial paralysis. The most common associated symptom with facial paralysis was vertigo in six patients. Twelve patients (50%) had no associated symptoms. Facial paralysis was the sole complication in 21 patients (87.9%). Three patients had multiple complications. Labyrinthitis was the most common associated complication. Facial paralysis was associated with congenital cholesteatoma in one patient. Fourteen patients (58.3%) demonstrated dramatic recovery within 3 months after surgery. Intraoperatively, cholesteatomas were found in 17 of the patients (70.8%). The fallopian canal was intact in four patients (none of them had a cholesteatoma), and 20 patients had bone destruction or dehiscence (three patients had no cholesteatoma). The tympanic segment was the most common site of involvement in 14 patients (58.3%). Conclusion(s): A middle ear cholesteatoma was present in the majority of patients with facial paralysis caused by chronic otitis media. Gradual onset of facial paralysis was the most frequent pattern. Facial paralysis presented poor prognosis regardless of the presence of a cholesteatoma. There was no statistical difference among the results of surgical techniques.

T1  - Management of anterior epitympanic cholesteatoma: Expectations after epitympanic approach and canal wall reconstruction
AB  - Background: The epitympanic approach to cholesteatoma provides excellent access to the anterior epitympanic space. When it is combined with reconstruction of the scutum, it is tempting to propose that the approach may offer the patient the advantage of both canal wall up and canal wall down techniques and the disadvantages of neither. In theory, then, the incidence of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma should be no greater than that for canal wall down surgery, and the need for a second look often associated with the canal wall up procedure should be less compelling. However, validation of this theory is lacking. Objective(s): To test this theory, we sought to establish the incidence of recidivism in patients undergoing cholesteatoma removal via the epitympanic approach followed by canal wall reconstruction, to identify anatomic factors predisposing to persistent disease, and to identify technical features or problems associated with recurrent cholesteatoma. Study Design: A retrospective case series. Setting(s): A tertiary referral center. Patient(s): Fifty-four adults and 11 children with extensive cholesteatoma involving but not limited to the anterior epitympanic space. Intervention(s): All patents underwent removal of cholesteatoma via the epitympanic approach with canal wall reconstruction followed by reexploration 1 year later. Result(s): Recurrent/residual disease was observed in 6 adults (11%) and 5 of 11 children (45%). The anterior epitympanic space harbored cholesteatoma in 100% of adults and 80% of children with recurrent disease. Conclusion(s): The epitympanic approach does not eliminate the need for reexploration in cases of extensive cholesteatoma involving the anterior epitympanic space. The anterior epitympanic space is highly likely to harbor residual disease. Features of the canal wall reconstruction can be identified that predispose to recurrence. Long-term follow-up and close surveillance are mandatory, especially in children.

T1  - One-stage reconstruction in management of extensive cholesteatoma
AB  - One-stage reconstruction utilizing, mainly, autogenous materials was done to assess feasibility, safety, and functional outcome. the study included 31 patients with extensive cholesteatoma. Wide exposure through canal wall down procedure, eradication of the pathology, and establishment of Eustachian tube patency were the principal goals leaving an area free of residual disease suitable for one-stage reconstruction. Autogenous conchal cartilage was utilized for reconstruction of the bony meatal wall. Plasti-Pore TORP prosthesis was used for ossicular reconstruction in cases with absent stapes (7 cases), otherwise temprofascial flap/ graft was applied directly over the stapes head as a columella. Intact, rigid, fully epithelialized canal wall was achieved in 100% of cases within 8 weeks. Graft failure with persistent middle ear infection occured in one case (3.2%). Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in one case that could be managed in the office and now it is free of disease. Hearing improvement occurred in 26/31 (83.9%) of cases with no significant difference between cases with columella-type and those with TORP prosthesis reconstruction. We concluded that one-stage reconstruction is a safe procedure in management of extensive cholesteatoma. Autogenous conchal cartilage is a suitable material for canal wall reconstruction. Columella type tympanoplasty, when stapes is intact, gives good anatomic and functional results without the need for alloplastic materials.

T1  - Surgical repair of bone defects of the ear canal wall with flexible hydroxylapatite sheets: A pilot study
AB  - Objective: Evaluation of suitability of flexible composite sheets (hydroxylapatite and polymer) for outer ear canal (OEC) wall reconstruction in tympanoplasty. Study Design: Prospective, open label pilot study. Setting(s): University and regional hospital. Patient(s): Forty-two randomly selected patients with chronic otitis media (n = 20) and cholesteatoma (n = 22) among 356 patients admitted between 1996 and 1997. Intervention(s): Eradication of disease through a partial or total canal wall down mastoidectomy; immediate reconstruction of canal wall with flexible composite sheet (hydroxylapatite and polymer) and connective tissue graft. Outcome Measures: Anatomic integrity of the OEC and neotympanum, extrusion rate, complications. Result(s): At minimum follow-up of 24 months: recurrent cholesteatoma (n = 0), residual cholesteatoma (n = 3/22) (13.6%) in the mesotympanum (none behind the hydroxylapatite sheet or in the attic or antrum). The neotympanum was intact in 38 ears (90.4%), reperforated in 2, and severely retracted and lateralized in 1, respectively. Anatomic integrity of the OEC was obtained in 37 (88%) of 42 patients; stenosis or membranous synechiae were observed in 5 ears and treated in the office. Extrusion of the hydroxylapatite sheet occurred in 7 patients (16.6%) because of purulent otorrhea and granulation tissue formation. Surgical revision achieved complete epithelialization of the rebuilt canal wall in 33 ears (78.6%). Conclusion(s): A dry, disease-free ear and normal anatomy may be expected 2 years postoperatively in more than three-fourths of the patients treated using the described surgical technique. Complete protection with a connective tissue graft is essential to avoid extrusion of the implant. The failure rate is significantly higher if otorrhea is present at the time of the operation.

T1  - Analysis of 100 cases of paediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Cholesteatoma in children presents the otolaryngologist with a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Management of paediatric cholesteatoma require special skill because of the extensive spread of disease at presentation. Postoperative follow up is also difficult in paediatric age group. Here in this retrospective study 100 cases of paediatric cholesteatoma treated at ENT department, Medical College Hospital were analysed. Ossicular involvement and bony erosion by cholesteatoma were noted particularly. A single staged operative procedure - canal wall down staged operative procedure - canal wall down mastoidectomy with or without tympanoplasty was adopted in most of the cases and found to be suitable in Indian condition where postoperative follow up is difficult.

T1  - Efficacy of surgical treatment of the chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. [Portuguese]
AB  - Objective: Evaluate the results of surgical treatment for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Canal wall down and intact canal wall procedure with tympanoplasty was performed. Study design: Retrospective chart review. Material(s) and Method(s): Data were analyzed from 36 patients (39 ears) available for clinical and audiometric studies with a minimum follow-up of 18 months. Sixteen cases (41,02%) underwent intact canal wall surgery with tympanoplasty, and 58,98% (N=23) underwent canal wall down surgery with reconstruction of the conductive system. Result(s): The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 12,5% (N=2) on intact canal wall procedure and 4,34% (N=1) on canal wall down. A safe and dry middle ear was achieved in 75,0% (N=12) of intact canal wall procedure and in 78,26% (N=18) of canal wall procedure. Regarding the functional hearing results, the intact canal wall group maintained the same level of pre-operative SRT. A slight increase on post-operative SRT level was observed on the canal wall down group (4 dB). Conclusion(s): For patients with cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media either intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty or canal wall clown with reconstruction of conductive system showed satisfactory results regarding the control of the cholesteatoma, once observing strict criteria for the indication of each technique. Better functional results could be expected with intact canal wall procedures.

T1  - Type III tympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration for cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - Background. The main objective of cholesteatoma surgery is complete eradication of the disease. Another goal is to preserve hearing acuity. We reviewed type III tympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration for cholesteatomatous ears. To evaluate the role of ossiculoplasty, the functional results of classic and modified type III tympanoplasties were compared. Methods. Thirty-six cholesteatomatous ears undergoing type III tympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration were reviewed. The same operator performed these operations from 1984 until 1995. According to the CAO staging system, there were five early, 16 moderate and 15 advanced-stage cases of cholesteatoma. Using the anterior approach, all operations were canal-wall-down type III tympanoplasties with "tailored" open cavity and cartilage obliteration. There were 24 classic and 12 modified type III tympanoplasties. Results. The average follow-up duration was 7.2 years. Neither recidivistic cholesteatoma nor retraction pocket was observed postoperatively. There was an improvement in atelectatic score after surgery. The mean postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 15.8 +/- 10.7 dB and the mean closure of the ABG was 4.0 +/- 14.3 dB. After the disease stage and preoperative hearing status were adjusted using regression analysis, there was no significant difference in hearing results between ears that underwent classic or modified type III tympanoplasties. Conclusions. We performed the canal-wall-down tympanoplasty with cartilage obliteration using the anterior approach for treatment of cholesteatoma. Such surgical techniques eradicate the cholesteatoma, prevent its recurrence and create a clean ear. Hearing reconstruction can also be accomplished in a single-stage procedure offering a serviceable hearing acuity.

T1  - Rigid internal fixation of the temporarily removed posterior wall of the external auditory canal: A new technique. [German]
AB  - Background: Temporary removal of the posterior external ear canal wall allows excellent exposure of the middle ear and epitympanum without the negative sequelae of a cavity as can occur after canal-wall down procedures. Safe fixation of the bony canal wall, however, has not always been possible with a risk for prolonged healing and bone necrosis. Material(s) and Method(s): A new technique permits rigid internal fixation of the posterior canal wall. A titanium miniplate of 10 holes length commonly used for orbital rim surgery is adapted to the cortical surface of the mastoid just posterior to the external ear canal. Six holes for 1.3 mm screws are drilled into the cortical bone: two screws behind the ear canal, two screws on the temporal line, and two on the mastoid tip. All fixation material is then removed and a mastoidectomy is carried out with preservation of the cortical bone for the screws. The external ear canal skin, which has been incised previously near the fibrous annulus with lateral extensions, is mobilized laterally using a newly designed retroflected microraspatory. This creates a vital skin flap that might be essential to avoid bone necrosis. No other skin incisions are needed in the canal. The posterior bony canal wall is cut using an oscillating saw Osseoscalpel, secured by facial nerve monitoring. After middle ear surgery and tympanoplasty have been completed, the canal wall is repositioned and fastened precisely in its place with rigid internal fixation allowing a secure stabilization. Result(s): This new technique has proven to be safe and reliable on the first five patients. There has been no bone necrosis within an observation period of 18 months. Conclusion(s): Rigid internal fixation is an alternative technique to safely readapt the posterior auditory canal wall.

T1  - The use of the temporal fascia pedicle flap for the reconstruction of the posterior wall in the external auditory meatus and osteovit obliteration of the mastoid process in the surgical treatment of chronic cholesteatoma in otitis media. [Polish]
AB  - The authors present the results of the treatment of 34 patients with chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media in whom the posterior wall of the external auditory meatus was reconstructed by remodelling the pedicel flap of the temporal fascia and by obliterating the mastoid process with Osteovit. The results of the operation were estimated with reference to the time of the postoperative cavity getting dry and compared with the control group of individuals in whom radical conservative operation was performed. The results proved that the epithelialization time was distinctly shorter and neither granulation nor otorrhea appeared during 24 months' observation.

T1  - Management of labyrinthine fistula in middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Labyrinthine fistula is a complication of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Canal wall down tympanoplasty with partial mastoid cavity obliteration and complete removal of cholesteatoma matrix was adopted in five cases of labyrinthine fistula. The operation resulted in elimination of vertigo. Sensory hearing has been saved in two cases. Air conduction hearing improved in one case. In three cases whose air conduction deteriorated post-operatively, bone conduction worsened in two cases and remained unchanged in one case (Tympanoplasty type 0 was performed in the other one case.) During the follow-up period, otorrhea improved in all cases and there was no evidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma. If the hearing of the other ear is acceptable, we suggest one-stage canal wall down tympanoplasty with complete removal of cholesteatoma matrix and partial mastoid cavity obliteration. It provides low recurrence rate of cholesteatoma and there is no need of re-operation.

T1  - The place of imaging and endoscopy in the follow-up and management of cases of cholesteatoma operated by the closed technique. [French]
AB  - The endoscopic approach to the middle ear in the eradication of cholesteatoma is now usually performed in association with the microscope utilisation. During the second look procedure, otoendoscopy allows to develop a new concept of surgery under video-control including minimal approach with a high quality of eradication control. In our series, we report 54 consecutives cases operated on intact canal wall-up technique, by the same surgeon. The mean follow-up delay was 29 months. Systematic second look was performed within the two first years following surgery. 76 % of the patients underwent minimal endoscopic approach. CT scan and/or MRI were performed in 37 patients before second look in order to correlate radiological and surgical findings. Second look results shows 45 patients on 54 (83,3 %) with normal ear (no cholesteatoma recurrence), and 9 patients (16,66 %) with residual cholesteatoma. Free air cavities were demonstrated by CT scan in 40,5 %, localised opacities in 7,9 % and total opacities in 51,4 %. All free air cavities on CT scan and MRI were non residual cholesteatoma ears. MRI cannot be used to screen for small cholesteatoma or to determine the characteristics of an opacity of the middle ear seen on CT in order. Therefore second look surgery is the gold standard study to diagnosis a residual cholesteatoma. Minimal endoscopic second look approach is a new cholesteatoma surgery concept better accepted by patients.

T1  - Thiersch skin grafting and postoperative care of otologic patients
AB  - When proper preoperative planning has been carried out and a flawless procedure has been performed, delivery of postoperative follow-up care ensures successful surgical outcomes. In many instances, postoperative care is as important as the actual surgical procedure, if not more important. Improper postoperative care by the patient or the physician, through neglect or ignorance, can lead to various minor complications that, if not treated promptly, may lead to significant morbidity and dissatisfaction in a patient and poor results. Assessment of proper meatal size, location of the eardrum (atelectatic or blunted), poor healing of the wound in the cavity or the ear canal, and proper hearing thresholds are important factors in the postoperative period. Failure of prostheses in the middle ear caused by immunologic rejection of the prosthesis or infection at the prosthesis needs to be recognized and treated accordingly. Patients need to be counseled preoperatively on possible needs for a delayed Thiersch skin grafting, second-look procedures, and long-term follow-ups (lifelong, in case of cholesteatoma). Thiersch skin grafting remains an excellent technique to ensure proper healing in the mastoid cavity and ear canal. This simple and effective procedure allows for a detailed postoperative check of the surgical sites, including a check of the position of the graff on the tympanic membrane, patency of ventilation tubes, healing in the canal, status of the mastoid cavity, and a final check for any residual surgical packing or suturing materials that could cause an indolent foreign body reaction. Delayed meatoplasty may avert long-term meatal stenosis after both canal wall-up procedures and canal wall-down procedures; this is a highly effective technique that allows for a much larger meatus, making care of the cavity easier for patients, the otolaryngologist, and dispensers of hearing aids. Meticulous and proper intraoperative handling of the facial nerve goes a long way toward avoiding postoperative facial palsies that invariably prove to be difficult to treat. Otologic surgeons must prepare themselves to deal with this tragic complication and must have a detailed plan ready to be implemented in such cases. In some cases, it may be highly beneficial to consult another competent otologic colleague to help with the management of postoperative paralysis of the facial nerve in a joint operation. Proper and prompt counseling of the patient is essential to achieve the best overall outcome in all otologic cases, particularly when severe complications, such as palsies of the facial nerve, are encountered.

T1  - Cholesteatoma otitis media with intact ossicular chain
AB  - Thirty-one cases of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain were reviewed to examine the extension of cholesteatoma, operation procedures, pre- and postoperative hearing levels, and postoperative condition of the ear drum. They were operated on at Departments of Hyogo College of Medicine and Osaka University Medical School from 1989-1996, which were 20.4% of all of the primary cholesteatoma cases (n = 152). Twelve cases located at attic were operated by atticotomy or canal wall up and scutumplasty, 17 cases located at attic/antrum were operated by canal wall down and reconstruction, and two cases located around stapes were operated through the ear canal. Preoperative hearing level was mild (34.2 +/- 18.4 dB)and postoperative one was slightly improved (28.7 +/- 11.2 dB). In ossicular reconstruction, modified Wullstein type III method showed better hearing gain than Wullstein type I method. Postoperative attic retraction and/or pocket occurred in 15 cases (48.4%), but no recurrent cholesteatoma was found during the present follow-up period. These findings suggested that cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain showed good postoperative hearing results, but postoperative retraction of the ear drum should be followed up for a long time.

T1  - Surgical treatments of cholesteatoma in children. [Chinese]
AB  - Background: Cholesteatoma in children have three characteristics: more extensive, faster growth rate, more difficult to handle than in adults. We analyzed three kinds of surgical treatments in order to find which method was more effective. Method(s): This retrospective study of 55 cholesteatomatous ears in 53 children aged 16 years or less, who were treated between 1981 and 1995. We classified the surgical methods into three groups: the canal wall up (CWU), the canal wall down (CWD) with open cavity, and the canal wall down (CWD) with cartilage obliteration of open cavity. Result(s): The CWU group (10 cases): The mean post-operative hearing gain was -2 dBHL. There were 2 cases of recurrence in this group. The CWD with open cavity group (23 cases): The mean post-operative hearing gain was 2 dBHL. No recurrence in this group. The CWD with cartilage obliteration of open cavity group: The mean post-operative hearing gain was 6 dBHL. No recurrence in this group. Conclusion(s): The CWD with cartilage obliteration of cavity surgery is the method of choice for children cholesteatoma, mainly because of better hearing results and no recurrence.

T1  - Cartilage reconstruction of the scutum defects in canal wall up mastoidectomies
AB  - Purpose: This study was performed to evaluate whether cartilage reconstruction of scutal wall defects diminishes retraction pocket and recurrent cholesteatoma, as compared with no cartilage reconstruction of the Scutal defect. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective chart review from 1980 to 1993 was performed on all patients undergoing a canal wall up mastoidectomy. These procedures were done in a large teaching hospital where some surgeons reconstructed with cartilage and others did not. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma and retraction pockets, as well as the need for further surgery, was assessed. Result(s): There were 103 canal wall up mastoidectomies performed, and 84 patients were available for long term follow-up. Of these, 52 were not reconstructed with cartilage, whereas 32 were reconstructed with cartilage. Of the 52 patients not reconstructed, 47% did not develop retraction pockets. Of the 53% who did develop a retraction pocket, only one third required further surgery, and the others were managed in the office. Of the 32 patients that were reconstructed with cartilage, 66% did not develop further retractions. Of the 34% who did develop a retraction pocket, one third required further surgery. In both groups, those who did require further surgery did have recurrent cholesteatoma as well. Conclusion(s): It would appear that reconstruction of scutal wall defects after canal wall up mastoidectomies with cartilage may be of some benefit in preventing further retraction pockets and thus the recurrence of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cause of posterior canal wall retraction after surgery from the viewpoint of mastoid conditions
AB  - Objective: To determine the relationship between preservation of the mastoid mucosa during ear surgery and retraction of the attic or posterior wall of the external auditory canal (EAC) and mastoid aeration after surgery. Methods and Design: Retraction of the posterior EAC wall and mastoid aeration were evaluated after surgery in 48 individuals (50 ears) with cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis media, or chronic suppurative otitis media, in whom the posterior bony EAC walls were removed with or without preservation of mucosa and reconstructed with soft tissues alone (EAC skin and temporal fascia) during surgery. Result(s): Postoperative computed tomography showed that in ears with notable retraction of the posterior EAC wall appearing like an open mastoid cavity, there was no air in the mastoid, whereas in ears with no or only slight retraction there was computed tomographic evidence of mastoid aeration. Second, notable retraction of the posterior EAC wall occurred in a significantly smaller percentage of ears in which at least the epitympanic mucosa had been able to be preserved during surgery than in those that had undergone removal of all mucosa (mastoidectomy). Conclusion(s): These results indicate that 1) preservation of epitympanic mucosa during surgery is an important factor for prevention of retraction of the posterior EAC wall and for reaeration of the mastoid after surgery, and 2) the intact canal wall technique seems to be indicated whenever at least the epitympanic mucosa can be preserved, and when no mucosa can be preserved the canal wall down procedure seems to be indicated.

T1  - A randomized, blinded study of canal wall up versus canal wall down mastoidectomy determining the differences in viewing middle ear anatomy and pathology
AB  - Hypothesis: Canal wall down and intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy represent two surgical approaches to middle ear pathology. The authors hypothesize that there is a difference in the ability to view structures in the middle ear between these two methods. Background(s): Depending on the individual, many surgeons have used the two different techniques of intact canal wall and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy for approaching the middle ear. However, opinions conflict as to which approach provides the best visualization of different locations in the middle ear. This study prospectively evaluated temporal bones to determine the differences in visualizing structures of the middle ear using these two approaches. Method(s): Twelve temporal bones underwent a standardized canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy using a reversible canal wall down technique. All bones were viewed in two dissections: intact canal wall and canal wall down preparations. Four points previously had been marked on each temporal bone in randomly assigned colors. These points include the sinus tympani, posterior crus of stapes, lateral epitympanum, and the Eustachian tube orifice. An observer blinded to the purpose of the study, color, and number of locations recorded the color and location of marks observed within the temporal bones. Randomized bones of two separate settings were viewed such that each bone was viewed in both the canal wall down and the intact canal wall preparations. Result(s): A significant difference was noted in the ability to observe middle ear pathology between the intact canal wall versus canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy, with the latter showing superiority (p < 0.001). Of the four subsites, the sinus tympani, posterior crus of stapes, and lateral epitympanum were observed more frequently with the canal wall down. There was no significant difference in the ability to observe the Eustachian tube orifice between the two techniques. Conclusion(s): Statistical analysis shows good reproducibility and randomization of this study. The canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy allowed for superior viewing of the three locations, sinus tympanic, posterior crus of stapes, and lateral at the tympanum, as they were marked in the study. This study shows the potential for improved visualization via the canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy. A significant amount of literature written by individuals and otology group practices is available retrospectively comparing the advantages and disadvantages of intact canal wall versus canal wall down mastoidectomy procedures for approaching middle ear pathology. In the interest of objectively evaluating the differences between these two approaches, we have studied temporal bones in a prospective randomized, blinded study comparing the two. Twelve bones were used and observed twice, once in each of 2 sessions. All bones were viewed in two dissections: intact canal wall and canal wall down mastoidectomy. Four points were marked on each temporal bone in three different colors applied in a randomized order to eliminate observer expectation. The four points marked include sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes footplate, lateral epitympanum, and Eustachian tube orifice. Both intact canal wall and canal wall down bones were provided randomly to the observer at each viewing session. Before the observer was allowed to see the dissections, those requiring replacement of the canal for the first session of the study had this done in a method using native posterior bony canal. Temporal bones were presented to an expert otologist in a randomized fashion with each temporal bone being placed in a temporal bone bowl holder and specialized framework, allowing for rotation and repositioning approximating the experience in an operating room setting. For each temporal bone, the observer filled in a questionnaire describing his or her observations by denoting both location and color of marks observed. Analysis of the results showed no significant difference between the number of observations made in the first sessi n compared to the second session, implying good randomization and no 'learning curve' for the observer from the first session to the second. In evaluating the ability to observe the four locations with the intact canal wall versus canal wall down dissection, a significant difference was noted with improved ability to identify the marks in the canal wall down bones. The sinus tympani, the posterior crus of the stapes footplate, and the lateral epitympanum were all identified more easily with the canal wall down approach. There was no significant difference in the ability to observe the marker at the Eustachian tube orifice with the canal wall up or the canal wall down. This study shows the differences in the ability to observe certain locations within the middle ear space that represent common sites of middle pathology such as cholesteatoma. For three of the four sites, the canal wall down procedure clearly showed an increased ability to visualize these regions.

T1  - Efficacy of tympanomastoid surgery for control of infection in active chronic otitis media
AB  - The efficacy of surgery in controlling infection in 272 tympanomastoidectomy procedures for chronic otitis media (COM) was assessed by means of a four-point rating scale that incorporated both symptoms and signs, such as the presence or absence of otorrhea and granulation tissue. Of the 272 procedures, 170 were performed for COM with cholesteatoma and 102 were for active COM with granulation tissue but no cholesteatoma. Forty- seven percent were primary procedures, and 53% were revisions. Minimum follow-up was 12 months for all cases, with a mean of 30 months. Adequate control of infection occurred in 248 (91%) of the 272 cases. Of the 24 cases (9%) that developed persistent infection, 10 were controlled with a combination of oral and topical antibiotics and/or delayed skin grafting in the office. Thus overall satisfactory control of infection was achieved in 258 of 272 cases (95%). The outcome was influenced by the diagnostic category of COM: COM with cholesteatoma did significantly better than COM with granulation tissue (P = 0.02). The outcome was not influenced by the following variables: primary versus revision surgery, canal wall-up versus canal wail-down surgery, and extent of disease. The results suggest that active COM with granulation tissue may be more difficult to control than COM with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Retraction pockets in the tympanic membrane - Aetiology and management - Our view point
AB  - Retraction pockets of the tympanic membrane are believed to be due to eustachian tube obstruction or malfunction. Our observations based on intraoperative findings suggest that the presence of a large sized mastoid antrum along with chronic eustachian tube obstruction plays an important role in the causation of retraction pockets. Granular myringitis may also occur in these circumstances when there is a recurrent eustachian tube blockage due to infection especially if the patient has received frequent and inadequate courses of antibiotics. The use of chromic catgut to create a healed air- filled middle ear space along with a canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy is discussed for their effective treatment.

T1  - Obliteration of mastoid cavities with ionomeric microimplant. [German]
AB  - Objectifs: In cholesteatoma surgery, the preservation or reconstruction of the posterior meatal wall may not appear feasible. In such situations the otologic surgeon creates a small mastoid cavity, allowing easy postoperative care. It can be obliterated with autogenous materials such as cartilage. Larger cavities can additionally be filled with alloplastic biocompatible materials. Patients and Methods: Mastoid cavities were obliterated in 61 patients using Ionogran, an ionomeric micro-implant (primary operations: 18 large cholesteatomas, revisions: 29 draining radical cavities, 9 recurrent cholesteatomas, 5 posterior meatal walls reconstructed with Ionocem). A Palva flap was rotated onto the hydrophilic, biostable bone substitute, and conchal cartilage was used to cover free granules. The tympanic membrane cover was rebuilt with perichondrium. Results and Conclusion(s): After 3 weeks the filler was covered completely by soft tissue in 76% and after 3 months in 92% of the cases. After 9 months, complete epithelialization had occurred in all cases. The epithelium lining the mastoid cavity remained unchanged in the majority of the patients throughout the time of follow up (maximally 6.5 years). In 2 patients (who had previously undergone repeated surgery) subepithelial cholesteatoma had developed in granular recesses. As downward spread was obscure, the microimplant was removed to eliminate any further risk (at 7 and 41 months postoperatively). In 3 patients (1 of them having undergone primary surgery, 2 having had previous surgery), a secondary epithelial deficit had developed over the granular material with attendant formation of intractable granulation tissue. As a consequence, the entire filling material had to be removed (at 15, 20, and 48 months postoperatively). In all biopsy specimens and explants studied, there was fibrous tissue encapsulation of Ionogran, but no evidence of new bone formation near the implant or degradation of the material. During the follow- up period of maximally 6.5 years, 5 patients had revisions (epithelial deficit 5%, cholesteatoma 3%). Ionogran, when used in combination with autogenous materials (e.g., cartilaginous tissue), has proved to be a useful filling material for obliteration of mastoid cavities.

T1  - Cochlear implantation in the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media
AB  - Nine patients are presented who underwent cochlear implantation in the presence of chronic suppurative otitis media. Four had a simple tympanic membrane perforation, four had a pre-existing mastoid cavity and one had cholesteatoma in the ear chosen for implantation. Patients with a simple perforation had a staged procedure with myringoplasty followed by cochlear implantation after an interval of three months. Patients with cholesteatoma or with an unstable mastoid cavity were also staged. A mastoidectomy or revision mastoidectomy was performed with obliteration of the middle ear and mastoid using a superiorly pedicled temporalis muscle flap and blind sac closure of the external meatal skin. After a further six months a second stage procedure was performed to confirm that the middle-ear cleft was healthy and to insert the implant. Patients presenting with a stable mastoid cavity underwent obliteration of the cavity and implantation of the electrode as a one-staged procedure. To date there have been no serious problems such as graft breakdown, recurrence of disease or implant extrusion, and all patients are performing well.

T1  - A surgical solution for the difficult chronic ear
AB  - We all encounter them: difficult chronic ears that seem to confound management efforts and that constitute an unrelenting imposition to the patient. Typically these ears have undergone multiple surgeries and are chronically infected. Such cases are commonly associated with residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Those rare ears that temporarily respond to therapy promptly recur once treatment is withdrawn. Even the most aggressive nonsurgical protocols fail these patients, who exhibit lifelong social and professional incapacity. They seem to ultimately defy resolution. The purpose of this article is to present a surgical solution to the difficult chronic ear dilemma that emphasizes disease control. Treatment outcome is reviewed in 541 cases. Management pitfalls are analyzed with follow-up, in some cases 20 years.

T1  - Cerebrospinal fluid fistula: The identification and management in pediatric temporal bone fractures
AB  - Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula represents a potentially lethal complication and requires a high index of suspicion to make the diagnosis. A 12-year retrospective study of pediatric basilar skull fractures identified 147 patients with temporal bone fractures, of which 37 patients exhibited evidence of CSF fistula. The diagnosis is made from a combination of clinical, radiographic, and chemical evaluation. The evolution of diagnostic techniques are reviewed, and the more recent and sensitive tests, such as beta-2 transferrin, are emphasized. Treatment of CSF fistula is nonsurgical in most cases. Surgical exploration and mastoid obliteration were required in two patients, and the indications for surgical treatment are explored. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial and not routinely indicated.

T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy: Causes of failure, pitfalls and their management
AB  - Managing patients with failed canal wall down mastoidectomy, requires a meticulous approach to control the disease and restore hearing. The present article reviews the causes of failure of the primary procedure and pitfalls encountered in 105 patients referred to our centre for revision canal wall down mastoidectomy. At post-revision surgery there were no cases with residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. The failures in our revision procedure were due to tympanic membrane perforation which occurred in five per cent (n = 4) and intermittent otorrhoea in two per cent (n = 2). A dry cavity with adequate middle ear space allowed for optimum audiological function even in revision canal wall down procedures.

T1  - Neuroradiological evaluation of high resolution after tympanoplasty. [Italian]
AB  - The most common reason for the surgical treatment of the middle ear is the presence of inflammatory diseases including: middle ear effusion, acute otitis media, granulation tissue, tympanic membrana retraction, non cholesteatomatous ossicular erosions, postinflammatory ossicular fixation and acquired cholesteatoma. Other pathologic conditions that require surgical procedures on the middle ear are: a) otosclerosis; b) neurinomas of the VII cranial nerve, c) traumatic dislocations of the ossicular chain; d) neoplasms. Otologic surgery has benefited from rapid developments in new instrumentations and techniques such as advanced microscopic system, grafting of biocompatible material and high resolution imaging methods. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is helpful not only prior to all mastoid operations but also as a tool for the evaluation of the postoperative middle ear and mastoid. This is true aspecially when surgery was performed since many years ago or when the surgeon was not the one referring the CT study. Among inflammatory pathologies, cholesteatomas represent a disease which need not only an accurate preoperative evaluation but also a postsurgical follow-up, because of the difficulty to remove totally the epithelial matrix of lesion, above all if located in particular regions of the middle ear. This difficulty gives reason for the significative number of residual cholesteatomas. During the recent years, surgical techniques underwent an important evolution going from radical mastoidectomy procedures to an increased utilization of conservative techniques canal wall down tympanoplasty, canal wall up tympanoplasty (TPL). Using this procedure the middle ear is protected by a reconstructed tympanic membrane; on the other hand in canal up surgery the mastoid is no longer available to inspection as in open cavities. HRCT proved to be the elective radiological technique for the demonstration of the temporal bone anatomy and for the evaluation of alterations caused by diseases and surgical procedures. The operation leads to a loss of normal anatomy and the presence of flogistic and reparative phenomena may obscurate the interpretation of radiological images. For these reasons an accurate knowledge of clinical and otoscopic findings, of the surgical approach and of the surgical findings is always desirable.

T1  - Reconstruction of the radical mastoid
AB  - Open cavity techniques (radical mastoidectomy, canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy) are well established surgical procedures for the treatment of chronic otitis media. Despite their effectiveness in exteriorizing cholesteatoma, they are associated with a 20 to 60 percent incidence of persistent intermittent drainage. In an effort to eliminate this problem, we have employed a Palva flap and medial graft technique to reconstruct the mastoid cavity and middle ear space in those patients with chronically draining ears. Between 1987 and 1990, 28 patients underwent this procedure. Twenty-six of these (93%) had complete obliteration of the mastoid cavity and successful tympanic membrane reconstruction. Two of 28 (7%) had a persistent tympanic membrane perforation and intermittent drainage following their surgery. Based on these results, this procedure is effective in eliminating intermittent drainage associated with the open cavity techniques. The indications for this procedure, the specifics of the surgical technique, and the postoperative results are discussed.

T1  - What is the best method of treatment for labyrinthine fistulae caused by cholesteatoma?
AB  - A series of 19 patients with a labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma was analysed. Two patients presented with acute suppurative labyrinthitis and meningitis. A canal wall down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Of the 17 patients with preserved inner-ear function, the cholesteatoma matrix over the fistula was removed in 10 resulting in severe sensorineural hearing loss in one of these. The matrix was left in situ in 7 patients and hearing was maintained or improved in all of them. Post-operatively, 2 patients suffered from vestibular disturbances, the matrix covering the fistula being removed in both of them. It was concluded that preservation of the matrix over the fistula is the safest method of management of this serious complication of cholesteatomatous chronic ear disease.

T1  - The pathogenesis and treatment of cholesteatoma
AB  - Congenital cholesteatoma, which arises from embryonic epidermoid tissue, is rare. In the majority of cases the cholesteatoma is acquired. It may develop as a retraction pocket involving the whole membrane, as a result of migration over the perforation edges or as basal cell invasion behind an intact membrane. There is no evidence for a metaplastic process or a Langerhans' cell mediated origin. Treatment modalities include several methods of either conservative or radical surgery, the main aim being one-stage total eradication of cholesteatoma and simultaneous reconstruction. With appropriate surgical methods recurrence figures after 5 years should remain under 10%. The patient's own tissues are the material of choice in the reconstruction.

T1  - Hydroxylapatite canal wall reconstruction in patients with otologic dilemmas
AB  - Posterior canal wall reconstruction using porous hydroxylapatite (HA), Grote canal wall prosthesis (Richards), has been recommended for obliteration of troublesome ''canal-wall-down'' procedures. The same method has been utilized during the management of diverse otologic problems. The results obtained encourage the further utilization of this technique in the management of various otologic dilemmas. Indications for reconstruction of the posterior canal wall using HA are suggested.

T1  - Hearing after surgery for cholesteatoma using various techniques
AB  - The late results in 740 patients with cholesteatoma subjected to one-stage canal wall down mastoidectomy (262 patients), modified canal wall up mastoidectomy (324 patients), and tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy (154 patients) were analyzed with regard to hearing and the condition of the drum. Mean observation time was 9.3 years, range 3-21 years. Postoperative hearing (air bone gap and pure tone average) and as hearing at the last evaluation was significantly better in the canal wall up group, than in the canal wall down group, but also the preoperative hearing was better in the canal wall up group. The postoperative hearing was best in the group with tympanoplasty only without mastoidectomy. It is concluded that no single method is optimal in all cases of cholesteatoma and that cholesteatoma surgery should be individualized.

T1  - Cholesteatoma 1982-1985
AB  - This is a review of the English literature relative to cholesteatoma from 1982 through 1985. The material is presented in 14 categories: histopathology; pathogenesis; congenital cholesteatoma; cholesteatoma in children; complications of the disease; surgical technique; postoperative cholesteatoma-failures and complications; petrous apex cholesteatoma and cholesteatoma granuloma; cholesteatoma following intubation; external auditory canal cholesteatoma; extramastoid cholesteatoma; radiography; cholesteatoma-congenital atresia; and miscellaneous subjects. A number of surgical technique articles have been published on canal wall down procedures, cavity problems (and how to avoid them), and indications and considerations in making the decision in regard to canal wall down. Residual cholesteatoma and recurrent cholesteatoma are considered in a number of articles, as are radiologic aspects and the diagnosis and follow-up of operated ears. There are also a number of good articles on congenital cholesteatoma and cholesteatoma in children. One report is of a 4-month-old child who had bilateral congenital cholesteatomas. Finally, you should read the article by Drs. Anthony and the abstracts by Pieper gerles et al and Neiburg et al on cholesteatoma of the external auditory canal. This is an uncommon but interesting lesion. An abstract preceded by [AA] indicates that this is the published abstract. An abstract not so preceded is an edited abstract. Material in brackets is an abstract or a comment by the senior author.

T1  - Partial obliteration of radical cavities by homologous cartilage chips. [German]
AB  - The article reviews, first of all, the common obliteration methods of radical cavities. This is followed by a description of the author's own technique which has been practiced for the last 13 years. This method employs preserved (Cialit solution 1 : 5000) homologous septal cartilage chips, shaped into small cubes of 3-4 mm. size. The chips are implanted in obscure areas (apical mastoid, sinus dura angle) of radical cavities for primary or secondary (old cavities) partial obliteration. Crushed homologous septal cartilage plates and temporal muscle fascia are placed additionally on the chips. The effect is the construction of a small, easy-care cavity, which can be appreciated at a glance. Statistical results of 314 cases (170 cases of primary obliteration, 144 old cavities) are presented. Chips in cavities are well tolerated. Chips were partially rejected in 13 cases only, whereas in 3 cases they were completely rejected. A permanent dry cavity and dry ear were achieved in 86% of the cases. Cholesteatoma recurred in 5 cases. The homologous cartilage technique is contraindicated in fistulas on the labyrinth or fenestra, as well as in exposed facial nerve or dehiscence of the facial nerve canal, in case of healed fistula of the dura, and in dissection of the sinus sigmoideus. In these cases, autologous cartilage (tragus, cavum conchae) must be implanted. One of the most important advantages of this method is that there is no crumpling up of the obliterated areas and no retractions over a longer period of time, compared with other relevant techniques (i.e., pedicled subcutis muscle grafts or free tissue flaps).

T1  - Resorbable, porous tricalcium phosphate ceramic in middle ear surgery. Preliminary clinical results. [German]
AB  - In our experimental study in the pig we could demonstrate that resorbable, porous tricalcium phosphate ceramic material is suitable for an obliteration of mastoid cavities (respectively the hypotympanon of the pig) or for the reconstruction of bony wall. To examine this material in a clinical study for middle-ear surgery, we chose 2 mm thick ceramic plates and segments of truncated cones. With the aid of a diamond drill and irrigation this ceramic can be treated easily. In 25 middle ears, the following reconstructive surgeries were performed with these ceramic implants: in 22 cases of partial replacement of the lateral attic wall, in one case a replacement of the total lateral attic wall, in one case a reconstruction of the canal wall after radical mastoidectomy, and in one case an obliteration of the mastoid cavity. These 25 ears have been followed up for 2-11 months with an average of 7.1 months. In 19 cases the implants showed no sign of any complication. In four cases, however, a dehiscence of the skinny covering (outer ear canal) was observed during the post-operative healing period. In one case this dehiscence closed spontaneously, in the other case we recovered the implant by surgery. In one patient we had to remove the implant, in another one the implant is uncovered and still under observation. An inflammation of the implant bed occurred once. One implant sank down into the middle ear cavity.

T1  - Is the resorbable, porous tricalcium phosphate ceramic suitable for obliteration of a not surely aseptic mastoid air cell system? A study in the bulla typanica of the pig. [German]
AB  - The usefulness of porous, resorbable tricalcium phosphate ceramic was examined for obliteration of not surely aseptic air cells. We used the hypotympanon (bulla tympanica) of 10 week old pigs as a model because it resembles the human temporal bone. Locally infection was induced by pseudomonas aeruginosa (E 13153/79). Two preliminary experiments were performed: First it was examined if tricalcium phosphate has an influence on the growth rate of bacteria. Secondly it was determined if pseudomonas can cause an inflammation in the bulla tympanica of the pig. Agar-diffusion-tests showed that tricalcium phosphate did not increase the growth rate of bacteria. However in some cases, evidence was found for a decreased growth rate in a manner which was not reproducible. Bacteriologically and histologically it could be demonstrated that pseudomonas had the ability to cause an infection in the bulla tympanica of the pig. In four specimens the basal cells of the bulla tympanica, close to the cavum tympani, were drilled out, leaving the apical cells intact. The cavity of operation was obliterated with adjacent layers of porous tricalcium phosphate ceramic. At the same time the apical cells were infected with pseudomonas. After having survived for one or four months the animals were sacrificed and the bulla tympanica removed. After one month survival pseudomonas could be detected bacteriologically. However, after four months survival this was not the case. One month after surgery and infection, histological sections demonstrated a clear inflammation in the region of the ceramic implant. At this time a bony remodelling of the implant was nowhere detected. Four months after operation and infection the inflammation was overcome for the most part. A bony remodelling of the ceramic was visible in regions free of inflammation. These experiments demonstrate that the ceramic implant will not be sequestered in spite of bacterial inflammation with pseudomonas. These results indicate that porous tricalcium phosphate ceramic may be a suitable material for obliteration of mastoid cavities, even after cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration. [Japanese]
AB  - Mastoid obliteration with autogenous cortical bone flakes and chips was performed in 113 ears. In some cases, pedicle periosteal flaps and/or free cartilagenous grafts from conchal cavity were used simultaneously. The reconstructed posterior canal wall had a tendency to widen slightly, and local infection did not occur. Clinically 80% of the cases were assessed as success. Hearing results were not at all superior to the closed method of tympanoplasty. The surgical method was safe and usefull for obliteration of cavity in contrast with mastoid obliteration using a pedicle muscle flap. In cholesteatoma cases, it is very difficult to reconstruct the well aerated mastoid cavity. The method to obliterate the mastoid and to open the epitympanum to the external canal is recommended for prevention of a retraction pocket.

T1  - Plaster of Paris: Thermal properties and biocompatibility: A study on an alternative implant material for ear surgery
AB  - There is no single technique for reconstruction of the canal wall following radical mastoidectomy. Autograft tissues may be unsuitable because of resorption and limited availability. An ideal foreign implant material should be bone-like in quality, non-ototoxic, readily available and malleable. Plaster of Paris, a degradable ceramic powder of CaSO4, may be regarded as a bone mineral. But a certain amount of heat develops during its solidifying process and may present a risk for injury to the facial nerve and the labyrinth. We studied the temperature rise with respect to added solution, to volume, and to surroundings, and investigated its biocompatibility when implanted in soft tissue in guinea pigs. The investigations suggested no risk of thermal injury and the biocompatibility was excellent. Hence plaster of Paris may constitute an alternative implant material for mastoid obliteration and reconstruction of the canal wall in ear surgery.

T1  - Post-operative roentgenological findings and changes after mastoid obliteration
AB  - This study consisted of the evaluation of the plain X-ray findings of films taken at early follow-up (mean 1.5 months after surgery) and at late follow-up (4-14 years after the early films) of 211 ears which had been operated on radically and obliterated. Residual cells which were detected on the basis of the early films were associated with a more frequent occurrence of post-operative infection and were thus hallmarks of a poorer prognosis. Changes in the bone surrounding the surgical cavity and the radiological quality of the walls of the surgical cavity, the presence of new bone formation in the cavity and other radiological features did not yield useful information about post-operative complications. New bone formation was associated with a smaller amount of post-operative cavitation. Post-operative X-ray examination of the obliterated ear is a prognostically useful examination, but it does not significantly contribute further to the information available by clinical and otomicroscopic examination in regards to the complications of infection and cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma after radical mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration
AB  - 680 Ears from a total of 922 ears operated in 1964-71 were followed 9-17 years (average 12.5 years) after radical mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration. In 34 ears a postoperative cholesteatoma was found. New cholesteatomas were discovered annually during the observation period. 10 Of these were considered to be residual cholesteatomas, 17 retraction pocket cholesteatomas and 7 epidermal migration cholesteatomas.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration. Histopathological study of three temporal bones
AB  - 3 temporal bones were serially sectioned to study the postoperative fate of the meatally based postauricular musculoperiosteal flap. In all 3 ears, the flap sealed off the middle ear effectively from the mastoid cavity, and in one, with a resected canal wall, formed a new soft posterior wall with good meatus. All flaps contained viable muscle, fat, collagen, reticulin, and elastin, and were richly vascularized. In 2 flaps, small granulating foci of infection were noted. In 2 temporal bones, from a child with hypogammaglobulinemia, small cholesterol cysts formed behind the flap during the delayed healing of the mastoid wounds.

T1  - Total obliteration of the chronic draining ear
AB  - Total obliteration of the mastoid and middle ear cavity with closure of the external auditory canal as a method of repair following surgery for chronic inflammatory disease has proven to be an effective and practical method of surgical treatment in selected patients. This method is effective for rapid, complete healing in those patients who are unable to care for a mastoid cavity and for those individuals who desire to engage in unrestricted physical activities following chronic ear surgery. Contra-indications to the employment of this technique are residual cholesteatoma, osteonecrosis, and metabolic disorders (i.e., diabetes mellitus) that may lead to poor healing. This technique has now been utilized in 12 patients with chronic inflammatory disease involving the middle ear and mastoid segments of the temporal bone. In all but one patient cochlear function was profoundly depressed and hearing improvement was not possible. All patients experienced rapid healing of the operative site, i.e., one to two weeks post surgery, and have permanent control of their chronic ear infection. There are no precautions for mastoid cavity care.

T1  - The meatally based musculoperiosteal flap in cavity obliteration
AB  - A meatally based musculoperiosteal flap that was formed for radical mastoid cavity obliteration was deliberately excised during revision surgery in three cases of recurring tympanic cholesteatoma. The flaps, which contained subcutaneous connective tissue, were well vascularized and contained large, viable muscle bundles and many nerve trunks from the postauricular branch of the facial nerve. In two cases, the periosteum-attached bone chips that had been removed from the patient's mastoid tip region and implanted to form a new bony canal wall were viable and gave the intended support for the meatus after radical ear surgery.

T1  - Surgical management of chronic otitis media and labyrinthine fistula
AB  - Although a high incidence of postoperative sensorineural loss follows operations for chronic otitis media, this increase could be reduced in the following ways: One should always ask the question: Is this operation really necessary? Obviously in cholesteatomatous ears it nearly always is, but there are exceptions especially among the elderly for whom regular suction toilet with the microscope often provides a safer alternative. Again as long as the incidence of sensorineural loss following attempts to reconstruct the ossicular chain in tympanosclerosis remains as high as at present, the virtue of prescribing a hearing aid as an alternative to surgical treatment should always be considered carefully. When operating to improve function, it should always be established with certainty that there is enough cochlear reserve to ensure that 'technical success' will bring the hearing level to within socially adequate limits, or at least that it will bring the hearing in the operated ear sufficiently close to that of the other ear to provide the 'balance' that is necessary for useful improvement in auditory function. The type of operation must be selected to suit the type of disease and not vice versa. When it is essential that no risk of hearing loss be incurred by the operation, an open technique with obliteration of the mastoidectomy cavity with a soft tissue plug is the only justifiable technique. In such an ear, because of the threat of all tympanoplasty techniques to the cochlea, there must be no attempt whatever to reconstruct either the ossicular chain or the tympanic membrane. The management of labyrinthine fistula due to cholesteatoma demands special consideration, and it is proposed that when the fistula is found by visual inspection and palpation of the matrix to be limited to the lateral semicircular canal, a two stage intact canal wall tympanoplasty will be the method of choice. While we await further evidence to the contrary, if the fistula is more extensive, it seems best to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy, leaving the cholesteatoma overlying the fistula utterly undisturbed. When cholesteatomatous fistula occurs in the only hearing ear, it is especially important and absolutely essential that no attempts be made to reconstruct the ossicular chain or to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. All who practice otologic surgery should continuously develop and review their knowledge and dexterity in the full realization that the successful management of chronic middle ear disease requires maximal awareness of many complex processes and the assumption of a very considerable responsibility to preserve and maintain the priceless sense of hearing without which our patients' quality of life is grievously impaired.

T1  - Mastoid and middle ear cavity obliteration for control of otitis media
AB  - Total soft tissue obliteration of the mastoid middle ear cavity and primary closure of the external auditory meatus were employed in six patients to control chronic suppurative otitis media. Previously, all these patients had unsuccessful surgery and all but one had profound loss of cochlear function. Thorough removal of cholesteatoma, granulation tissue, and ear canal skin is necessary before total obliteration can be performed safely. Wound healing was complete by one to two weeks postoperatively and all patients have been asymptomatic for two to seven years.

T1  - Postoperative cholesteatoma in combined approach tympanoplasty. Fifteen year report on tympanoplasty. Part I
AB  - The purpose of this study has been to discover the degrees of reliance which can be placed on some of the tympanoplasty techniques which are in current use. The evidence is derived from a personal series of over 2,700 operations carried out between January 1960 and December 1974. This long term survey of the cholesteatomatous complications of combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) has revealed an unexpectedly high rate of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma. The chief criticism of CAT is not so much that there are cases of residual disease but rather that they cannot be detected for long periods. Achievement of the ultimate solution appears to depend initially on a total rejection of the idea that successful tympanoplasty can be achieved only when the osseous canal wall is maintained. After that, better results will be achieved consistently through a combination of well performed mastoidectomy, cavity obliteration and mesotympanic reconstruction. Obviously, residual cholesteatoma will still occur in the epitympanum, but it is hoped that it will be easily managed and pose no threat to the patient. Without doubt, if it is agreed that the prime aim of tympanoplasty is to eradicate irreversible disease and the findings of this investigation are accepted, then it follows that the place of CAT in the routine management of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma requires further assessment.

T1  - Fifteen years's experience in tympanoplasty, with special reference to children
AB  - Fifteen years' experience in tympanoplasty has elucidated the following facts:- In radiography of the mastoids it is impossible to distinguish between sclerotic structure and one which is cellular but nonaerated, the cells being filled with fluid, thickened mucosa, and granulations. The younger the child the greater is the chance of an erroneous report. The failure to recognize the presence of nonaerated cells is an important factor in the persistent infection seen in mastoid bowls; the rationale for antrostomy in all cases of tympanoplasty unless the mastoid process has a well defined uninvolved cellular system and the ear has been dry for a long period. In cases of chronic suppurative otitis media, correlation between the nature of the mastoid as seen at surgery on the one hand, and the age of the patient on the other, shows that the older the patient the greater the degree of sclerosis. This suggests that sclerosis is a gradually acquired condition, and is probably the result of non aeration of the mastoid process. (Conversely, sclerosis is not usually due to an inhibition of the process of cellular development due to some infective process in early life.) The management of cholesteatoma in childhood is the most difficult problem in tympanoplasty. There is no difficulty in obtaining excellent results in older children and adults, but in young children the incus must be removed even if the chain is intact in order to clear the disease. (Without this radical measure the failure rate is 68%.) The breakdown rate is also greater in young children when closed methods of surgery are adopted. Therefore, in young children open methods should be used if there is any doubt as to the clearance of the disease. Also it has been the author's experience that hearing results are not better when a closed method is used. The combined method of obliterating the mastoid bowl following a radical mastoidectomy is giving adequate results; this is another reason why one should not hesitate to perform radical mastoidectomy in young children when in doubt. (The technique consists of initial free graft of connective tissue followed, if necessary, by an overlaid pedicle of temporal muscle.) The long term results of the repositioning of an autogenous incus between the malleal handle and stapes head show satisfactory hearing improvements in 62%. Sensorineural loss has not been a problem. The long term results with Smyth's boomerang prosthesis (homologous septal cartilage stiffened with wire) show a worthwhile hearing improvement in 53%. While these results are an improvement on those obtained by previous techniques in cases where there are no ossicles, nevertheless there is further room for improvement. Experience shows that immunity defects, both cellular and humoral, and various congenital lesions, can threaten a successful outcome in tympanoplasty.

T1  - Efficacy of mastoid cortex plasty for middle ear aeration in intact canal wall tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of closing the bone defect of the mastoid cortex using bone pate after mastoidectomy (mastoid cortex plasty) during the first-stage operation for the restoration of the mastoid cavity aeration. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Thirty-five patients with cholesteatoma invading the mastoid cavity. INTERVENTION: Seventeen patients received mastoid cortex plasty with scutum plasty and insertion of a Silastic sheet after removal of the cholesteatoma using a combined approach during the first-stage operation. The 18 control patients received only scutum plasty with the insertion of a Silastic sheet without mastoid cortex plasty during the first-stage operation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The restoration of the middle ear aeration was assessed with high-resolution computed tomography before both the first-stage operation and the second-stage operation. RESULTS: The range of middle ear aeration ameliorated significantly whether or not mastoid cortex plasty was performed. Scutum plasty with the insertion of a Silastic sheet without mastoid cortex plasty was significantly effective only for the amelioration of the epitympanum aeration. Mastoid cortex plasty with scutum plasty with the insertion of a Silastic sheet was significantly effective for the amelioration of the epitympanum and also the mastoid cavity aeration. In both groups, before the first-stage operation, approximately 70% of the patients had good mesotympanum aeration, and the mesotympanum aeration ameliorated further after the first-stage operation, although this amelioration was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Mastoid cortex plasty is statistically effective for the amelioration of mastoid cavity aeration after the first-stage operation.

T1  - Efficacy of the KTP laser in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ancillary use of the KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate) laser can diminish the rate of residual disease in intact canal wall cholesteatoma surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective controlled parallel group study. SETTING: Two neighboring district general hospitals, one with a KTP laser and one without. PATIENTS: All patients undergoing staged intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma. INTERVENTION: Staged intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Presence or absence of residual disease at the second stage operation, performed at least 12 months after the first operation. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients underwent treatment without and 36 underwent treatment with the laser. Ten patients without laser treatment had residual disease, whereas one patient had residual disease after laser treatment (p = 0.003). After adjustment using logistic regression, treatment still has a significant effect on outcome (p = 0.013). The number needed to treat is four. DISCUSSION: Ancillary use of the KTP laser in cholesteatoma surgery is a treatment that significantly improves complete removal of disease.

T1  - Use of Biodesign(R) Otologic Graft in Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy: a Prospective, Randomized Trial
AB  - Patients 18 or older will undergo primary canal wall down mastoidectomy. Patients with known biologic sensitivity or cultural objection to use of porcine materials will be excluded. Data will be derived from the medical record and surgeon reports as detailed on pre-op and follow-up forms. Variables collected include age, gender, medical co-morbidities, body mass index, pre-operative audiometric values (including word recognition score, pure tone average, and air bone gap), side of surgery, size of operative cavity, infectious state (draining versus dry), exact surgical procedure, presence of cholesteatoma, time to dry cavity, time to complete epithelialization (as observed directly by the surgeon), and post-operative complications (such as persistent perforation, drainage, granulation tissue formation, and facial nerve outcomes). Dates and patient number will be recorded. Patients will be randomly assigned using randomization software, whereby patients will be assigned a sequential research number that is pre-randomized to one research arm. The study cannot be blinded, as the surgeon will be able to identify which graft will be used. De-identified photographs of the post-operative outcomes at each time point will be recorded photographically. Three physicians will review these photographs without prior knowledge of the treatment arm.

T1  - Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main surgical techniques for the treatment of chronic otitis media so far, all have their characteristic advantages and disadvantages. Otolaryngologists have been trying to find an ideal surgical method for chronic otitis media. // OBJECTIVE: To study and evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved tympanomastoidectomy (PCM) for the treatment of chronic otitis media. // METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. Twenty patients underwent PCM and 19 underwent canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy (CWD). All patients had a follow-up period of 5 years. // RESULTS: The mean time of healing was 6 weeks in the PCM group and 8 weeks in the CWD group. The cavities in the PCM group were normal or slightly larger than the normal external auditory canal. The patients required cavity cleaning less than once per year in the PCM group and 3-4 times per year in the CWD group. One patient in the PCM group developed a recurrent cholesteatoma located in the attic. // CONCLUSION: The PCM technique showed a low-recurrence rate and good hearing outcomes. Patients had normal or slightly enlarged postoperative external auditory canal. Therefore, PCM is a useful technique for chronic otitis media.

T1  - Randomized clinical trial for partial canal wall preserved mastoitympanoplasty
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: To study and evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved mastoitympanoplasty (PCM) for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and/or granulation tissue. Methods: Thirty-nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. 20 patients underwent PCM, 19 patients underwent canal wall down mastoitympanoplasty(CWD). All of the patients had a follow-up period of 5 years. Results: All the patients in the two groups underwent the operation successfully and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were found. The mean time of drying of cavity was 6 weeks (4-8weeks) in the PCM group, while it was 8 weeks (6-10weeks) in the CWD group. The cavity in the PCM group were near normal or slightly larger than the external auditory canal, and the tympanal flaccid part slightly wider than normal, patients could able to wear traditional hearing aids. The patients need cavity cleaning less than 1 times a year in the PCM group and 3-4 times a year in the CWD group. The surgery cavity volume was 1.4 + 0.2 ml in the PCM group and 2.6 + 1.1 ml in the CWD group (P < 0.05), the difference was statistically significant. There were 8 patients (40%) improved hearing level (threshold improved>10 dB) 5 years after operation in the PCM group and 6 patients (32%) in the CWD group, no statistically significant difference. 1 patient (5%) developed a recurrenct cholesteatoma which was located in the attic and 4 patients (20%) developed retraction pockets in the attic in the PCM group, while 3 patients (15.8%) developed cavity problem that the epithelial accumulation were not easy to clean in the CWD group, no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: With PCM technique, cholesteatoma could be completely and safely removed from the middle ear, and patients had near normal postoperative external auditory canal. Therefore, PCM was a reasonable choice for the surgery of otitis media with cholesteatoma and/or granulation tissue.

T1  - Piezosurgery versus microdrill in intact canal wall mastoidectomy
AB  - Piezosurgery is a recently developed system for cutting bone with microvibrations. The objectives of the present study were to report our experience with the piezoelectric device in the intact canal mastoidectomy, and to compare the results with traditional method by means of microdrill. A non-randomized controlled trial was undertaken on 60 intact canal wall mastoidectomy performed using the piezoelectric device (30 patients) or the microdrill (30 patients). Before 1 month and 1 year after surgery, all the patients underwent the following instrumental examinations: otomicroscopic evaluation of the tympanic membrane and external auditory duct, bone conduction threshold audiometry, tympanometry, transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions with linear click emission, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, auditory brainstem response (ABR) by MK 12-ABR screener with natus-ALGO2e (Amplifon, Milan, Italy), and electronystamographic recording. The piezoelectric device is proved to be effective in sclerotic and pneumatic mastoid, with an excellent control and without side effects on the adjacent structures of the middle and inner ear (lateral sinus, facial nerve, and/or dura mater). The operation time has been the same as compared with microdrill, and the average hospital stay was significantly (p < 0.05) shorter. Postoperatively, all patients had uneventful recovery with no evidence of audiovestibular deficit or side effects. Our experience highlights the safety of the piezoelectric device on the anatomic structures of the middle and inner ear, and demonstrates its efficiency in terms of cutting precision and healing process.

T1  - Stabilising total ossicular replacement prosthesis for ossiculoplasty with an absent malleus in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy - a randomised controlled study
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare two titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) stabilisation techniques in canal wall down mastoidectomy presenting with footplate only and absent malleus handle. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled, randomised study. SETTING: Tertiary Otology Department. PARTICIPANTS: Patients operated on with canal wall down mastoidectomy between 1999 and 2009 were randomised into two groups. Two techniques enhancing the TORP stability were compared: Huttenbrink's method (63 patients, Group 1) and author's (GB) procedure (62 patients, Group 2). Huttenbrink's technique consists in placing a cartilage shave with a hole in the middle over the footplate. Through this hole, the end of the TORP is accommodated. The author's method involves using a cartilage split in the middle, to lodge the TORP's shaft at one end and to lay the opposite end over the fallopian canal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean postoperative air-bone gap, hearing gain and air-bone gap closure within 20 dB. Auditory outcomes were evaluated at 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: Postoperative air-bone gap closure within 20 dB (successful outcome) at 1 year was achieved in 59% of patients in Group 1 and 72% in Group 2 (P = 0.03). Mean postoperative air-bone gap was 24.4 +/- 10.8 dB for Group 1 and 20.17 +/- 9.8 dB for Group 2. The difference is 4.23 dB (95% confidence interval, 0.65-07.81), statistically significant: P = 0.02. Hearing gain was 20.3 +/- 9.5 in Group 1 and 25.1 +/- 10.2 in Group 2, significantly superior: P = 0.007. CONCLUSION: Better hearing outcomes for author's method could be demonstrated, but our sample size cannot exclude small and possible trivial, group differences.

T1  - Split thickness skin grafting in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the effects of a split thickness skin graft (STSG) on the healing of the mastoid cavity in patients undergoing canal wall down (CWD) procedures. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective randomized study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-four patients, ages 21 to 82 years, with a diagnosis of cholesteatoma, undergoing CWD tympanomastoidectomy for the first time. INTERVENTION: Placement of a STSG to line the mastoid cavity at the time of surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the amount of time required for epithelialization of the mastoid cavity. Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, specifically, presence of otorrhea, granulation tissue, meatal stenosis, or tympanic membrane perforation. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients met inclusion criteria. Thirteen patients were randomized to the study group and 11 patients to the control group. Data were collected at follow-up appointments scheduled at postoperative Weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12, as well as every 6 months thereafter. Average time for successful epithelialization of the cavity in the STSG group was 3.2 weeks. Average time for successful epithelialization of the control group was 6.6 weeks. Using a 1-sided 2 sample t test, this was found to be statistically significant with a p value of 0.000137. There was no significant difference in complications rates between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Placement of a STSG is a technique available to the otologist to facilitate rapid healing and epithelialization in patients undergoing CWD tympanomastoidectomy.

T1  - Surgery of sinus tympani cholesteatoma : Endoscopic necessity
AB  - Objective: Residual cholesteatoma occurs as a consequence of growth of a fragmental remnant of the matrix inadvertently left behind at the time of primary surgery. Poor access is the major reason for residual disease, particularly in the sinus tympani (ST). The ST is a critical anatomic region considered the most hidden recess of the middle ear. The aim of our study was to highlight the importance of extension of cholesteatoma into the ST and to demonstrate the efficacy of oto-endoscopy allowing direct access to eradicate disease from this potentially dangerous site. Materials and Methods: A total of 294 ears with acquired cholesteatoma (primary or secondary) were operated on. In this study, 212 cases were operated upon using canal wall up (CWU) technique, and 82 cases were operated upon using canal wall down (CWD) procedure. Oto-endoscopy was incorporated complementary to the microscope as a principal part of the procedure in all cases. Second-look endoscopic exploration was performed on some selected cases, depending on the operative details during the primary surgery and the postoperative findings of clinical and radiologic studies. Results: In the primary surgery after completion of microscopic cleaning, the overall incidence of intraoperative residuals detected with the endoscope was (49 cases) 16.7%. Sinus tympani was the most common site of intraoperative residuals in both CWU and CWD groups (36.7%), followed by the facial recess (28.6%), and the undersurface of the scutum in the CWU cases (20.4%); and the anterior epitympanic recess (14.3%). Reconstruction of the hearing mechanism was performed during the primary surgery in 246 cases (83.7%) and postponed to the second stage in only 48 cases (16.3%). Out of the 212 CWU cases, 93 second-look endoscopic explorations (43.9%) were performed. Eight recurrences (8.6%) were identified: 5 cases showed one or more recurrent cholesteatoma pearls, and 3 cases showed a larger open cholesteatoma recurrence extending to the aditus and mastoid. In this series, no morbidity or complication was encountered secondary to the use of endoscopes in the mastoid or middle ear. Conclusions: From our experience in endoscopic ear surgery we have come to the conclusion that the ability of endoscopes to peer into the recesses of middle ear and mastoid cavity proved without doubt its usefulness. The use of endoscope achieved significant higher degree of control over the disease and dramatically reduced the incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence particularly in those hidden recesses such as the sinus tympani.

T1  - Clinical significance of Î²-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate for mastoid cavity obliteration during middle ear surgery: Human and animal study
AB  - Objectives. Mastoid obliteration is used to obliterate the mastoid cavity following a mastoidectomy or to prevent the formation of a retraction pocket. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Î²-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate (Î²-TPP) for mastoid obliteration in middle ear surgeries in prospective human and animal studies. Methods. Twenty patients with chronic otitis media underwent mastoid obliteration using Î²-TPP after a intact canal wall mastoidectomy or simple mastoidectomy. The clinical data were prospectively evaluated including: the diagnosis, temporal bone computed tomography (TBCT), otoscopic findings, pure tone audiogram, and complications. In the animal experiment, Î²-TPP was applied into the right bulla in five rats, and the opposite bulla was used as the control in the non-obliterated state. The skulls of five other rats were drilled out and the holes were obliterated with Î²-TPP. TBCT were obtained at 3, 6, and 9 months after the obliteration and histologic analysis was done at 3 and 9 months after surgery. Results. In the human study, fourteen TBCTs were obtained at 12 months after the surgery. All demonstrated no bone re-sorption in the obliterated mastoids. Among the 15 cases displaying retracted tympanic membranes preoperatively, 11 showed no retraction, 2 showed retraction postoperatively, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 was a case of postoperative wound infection. Among 20 cases, one case developed a postoperative infection that necessitated a second operation. Sixteen underwent ossiculoplasty; hearing improvements were obtained in 15 cases and 1 case showed decreased hearing. In the animal study, new bone formation without significant bone resorption in the radiologic and histologic findings were noted in both the skull and bulla groups. Conclusion. Although Î²-TPP is a foreign material having the possibility of infection, mastoid obliteration with it can be a treatment option in middle ear surgeries to prevent retraction pockets or the recurrence of diseases.

T1  - Facial nerve dehiscence at mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: The incidence and localization of facial nerve dehiscence (FND) in patients undergoing mastoidectomy for middle ear cholesteatoma were determined. Various clinical factors predictive of FND preoperatively were also researched. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 112 patients (115 ears) undergoing mastoidectomy by canal wall-up or canal wall-down methods during a five-year period was conducted, recording occurrence rates and sites of FND at the time of surgery. Correlations between FND and clinical features (age, sex and surgical technique) or intraoperative findings (dural exposure, labyrinthine fistula, and the absence of the stapedial suprastructure) were ascertained, based on Fisher's Exact or Chi-Square statistical analyses. Results: FND occurred in 33 (28.7%) of 115 ears. Involvement of tympanic segment only (81.8%) predominated over mastoid segment alone (9.1%) or tympanic and mastoid segments together (9.1%). Intraoperative absence of stapedial suprastructure was significantly with FND (p=0.012), while dural exposure or labyrinthine fistula at surgery and FND showed no clear associations (p>0.05). Conclusion: The incidence of FND was 28.7%, with preferential involvement of tympanic segment. Since the absence of stapedial suprastructure correlated with FND, lost integrity of the stapes may preoperatively predict FND. Therefore, otologic surgeons should be particularly cautious during mastoidectomy, given these conditions. Â© The Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology.

T1  - One-stage reconstruction in management of extensive cholesteatoma
AB  - One-stage reconstruction utilizing mainly autogenous materials was done to assess feasibility, safety, and functional outcome. The study included 31 patients with extensive cholesteatoma. Wide exposure through canal wall-down (CWD) procedure, eradication of the pathology, and establishment of Eustachian tube patency were the principal goals leaving an area free of residual disease suitable for one-stage reconstruction. Autogenous conchal cartilage was utilized for reconstruction of the bony meatal wall. Plasti-Pore TORP prosthesis was used for ossicular reconstruction in cases with absent stapes (seven cases), otherwise, temprofascial flap/graft was applied directly over the stapes head as a columella. Intact, rigid, fully epithelialized canal wall was achieved in 100% of cases within 8 weeks. Graft failure with persistent middle ear infection occurred in one case (3.2%). Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in one case that could be managed in the office, and now, it is free of disease. Hearing improvement occurred in 26:31 (83.9%) of cases with no significant difference between cases with columella type and those with TORP prosthesis reconstruction. We concluded that one-stage reconstruction is a safe procedure in management of extensive cholesteatoma. Autogenous conchal cartilage is a suitable material for canal wall reconstruction. Columella-type tympanoplasty, when stapes is intact, gives good anatomic and functional results without the need for alloplastic materials.

T1  - Problems of the Open Mastoid Cavity
AB  - The open method is useful as a surgical technique for aural cholesteatoma or adhesive otitis media, but there are problems that arise from the opened mastoid cavity. Eighty-five ears with mastoid cavity problems, which had been operated on at our clinic from 1982 to 1991, were examined in this study. Earlier, One operation had been conducted on 52 ears, 2 on 24 ears, 3 on 7 ears, and 4 and 5 on 1 ear each. The average number of operations per ear was thus 1.5. The time since the first operation was 3 years and 4 months to 58 years and 1 month (average, 28 years and 11 months). The initial disease was chronic suppurative otitis media in 24 ears, aural cholesteatoma in 19, acute mastoiditis in 9 and unknown in 33. The main complaint of 62 patients was otorrhea. Thirty-four were found to have vestibular vertigo when the mastoid cavity was being cleaned. Only 8 labyrinthine fistulae were recognized during operation. In 45 ears the malleus was missing, in 51 ears the incus, and in 37 ears the stapedial super-structure. The mastoid was obliterated in 69 ears, bone chips were used in 50 ears and hydroxy -apatite granules in 19 ears. The canal wall was reconstructed in 10 ears and revision operation was conducted in 6 ears. After mastoid obliteration, otorrhea was found in 6 patients, drum retraction in 6, and drum perforation in 2. In 31 of the 34 patients with vertigo there was good improvement after the operation. Hearing was generally not improved, especially in types 3 and 4 with ossicular reconstruction. Â© 1994, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Clinical analysis of 22 cases with automastoidectomy caused by cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: Automastoidectomy is an uncommon but unique complication of middle ear cholesteatoma that has been understudied in the current literature. The authors treated patients suffering from automastoidectomy due to cholesteatoma and reported clinical features of this complication. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study with medical records review was performed in tertiary care academic otolaryngology practice. Patients with chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media who showed evidence of automastoidectomy by temporal bone computerized tomography (TBCT) were included. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative records were analyzed retrospectively. Results: There were 22 patients with automastoidectomy. Symptoms were otorrhea, hearing disturbance, otalgia, and facial palsy. Procedures performed were as follows: 2 patients underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy, 19 patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, and 1 patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy. The rates of facial nerve palsy and labyrinthine fistula were 9.1% and 36.4%, respectively. Postoperatively, hearing improved in 1 case and 2 cases resulted in deafness. Conclusion: Despite relatively minor symptoms, operative findings were severe in automastoidectomy. Precise preoperative evaluation and a thorough explanation to patients are necessary. Additionally, any surgical procedure involving the middle or inner ear must be performed by an experienced surgeon.

T1  - Facial canal dehiscence and tympano-mastoid surgery
AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the incidence of facial canal dehiscence in patients with chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis and tympanosclerosis who underwent canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy or canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective study in a tertiary referral hospital of operated 228 patients between April 2008 and June 2013. Using intraoperative findings, data were collected regarding the patients' age upon presentation, gender, clinical diagnosis, presence of cholesteatoma, preopeartive and postoperative facial nerve function, presence or absence of facial canal dehiscence and its location, lateral semicircular canal fistula or dural exposure due to erosion of bony plate. Results: The frequency of facial canal dehiscence in our patients was 28.1%. The most common site of dehiscence (68/228, 82.8%) was the tympanic segment (P<0.001) and the incidence of facial canal dehiscence in ears with cholesteatoma (92.2%) was distinctly higher than than other ears (P < 0.001). When the pediatric group (=16 years of age) and the adult group (>16 years of age) were compared, 10.5% of the 38 pediatric age patients had facial canal dehiscence, while 31.6% of the 190 adult patients (P<0.05). The most common accompanying findings were respectively dural exposure (12.7%) and lateral semicircular canal fistula (11%). There was a statistically significant correlation between semisircular canal fistula and dehiscence (P<0.001) and in the ears with dural exposure and dehiscence (P<0.01). The dehiscence was was seen significantly more often in patients who had the canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy than in those who had the canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (P<0.001). The incidence of dehiscence was more often in female patients and in primary surgery group but both results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Dehiscence of facial canal was mostly seen in patients with cholesteatoma and mostly located in the tympanic segment. Also, most common site for the facial nerve injury during otologic surgery is the tympanic segment and mechanical dissection is most often indicated in this region. The presence of semicircular canal fistula and dural exposure on preoperative computerized tomography of temporal region are invaluable clue for presence of dehiscence.

T1  - Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique in middle ear surgery: 12-Year result
AB  - Objective; The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration (EMO). Canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy can secure a good surgical field, allowing lesions to be eliminated. However, cavity problems inevitably occur. Canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy can avoid cavity problems, but complete removal of lesions is more difficult, and retraction pockets can form. The goal of EMO is to obtain optimal surgical results as in CWD surgery while avoiding cavity problems. Here we introduce the surgical techniques of EMO and discuss the results. I Materials & Methods; A retrospective case review of 401 ears in 398 patients was performed. The EMO technique consists of a simple mastoidectomy, atticotomy, epitympanectomy and epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration. The results of 12 years of surgery performed between December 1994 and June 2007 were analyzed and the outcomes of the procedures were evaluated. Results; Postoperative results from 401 ears were evaluated. The mean age was 42 years, and the mean follow up period was 30 months. There was a 6.2 ( 7.8 dB hearing gain (p<0.05), and the tympanic cavity cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 4.2%. In 0.9 % of cases, there was a residual mastoid cholesteatoma, and these cases underwent revision CWD surgery. There was no attic retraction or retraction pocket formation. Conclusion; Using EMO techniques, we can eliminate the disadvantages of CWD and CWU mastoidectomy. Cavity problems can be avoided and retraction pocket formation can be prevented. EMO is a useful technique and can be considered before CWD surgery. Copyright 2005 Â© The Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology.

T1  - Epithelial Pocket after Intact Canal Wall Tympanoplasty for Middle Ear Cholesteatoma
AB  - Eighty four ears with middle ear cholesteatoma were operated on using a staged intact canal wall (IGW) tympanoplasty between November 1976 and February 1988. In 17 of the 84 ears, a deep pocket-like epithelial invasion into the antrum or the mastoid cavity was found at the second stage operation. These 17 ears have no relation to age and extent of cholesteatoma noted at the first stage operation, and between these and 67 others no difference except bony defects could be seen with regard to their operative findings, such as inflammation and aeration in the middle ear. A bony defect was recognized in 13 of these in either the lateral wall of the attic or the posterior wall of the external auditory canal, through which the pocket developed. The present findings suggest that the bony defect is critical to form the pocket after the IGW tympanoplasty. A reconstruction of the bony defect with obliteration of the mastoid cavity is concluded to be reasonable to prevent pocket formation. Â© 1990, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Acquired cholesteatoma in children: Clinical features and surgical results
AB  - Acquired cholesteatoma in children is an aggressive disease due to its rapid growth and high recurrence rate. Objective: To assess clinical features of cholesteatoma in children and evaluate our experience in the surgical management of this disease. Methods: Fourty children aged 5-16 years operated on for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma (2002-2011), were included in our study. Surgery was bilateral for 3 patients, which makes a total number of 43 operated ears. Functional and anatomical results were evaluated after a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Results: Mean age at the first operation was 11.7 years. Canal wall-up tympanoplasty (CWUT) was performed as first-line procedure in 74% of cases. Canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) was performed in 26% of cases when cholesteatoma was hardly controllable with a CWUT. Cartilage graft was used in all cases for eardrum reinforcement. After a mean interval of 12.2 months, second look procedure aimed to verify a residual cholesteatoma in 8 cases and perform an ossiculoplasty in one case. Total cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 18% with CWUT and 9% with CWDT (p= 0.4). Predictive factors for recurrence were: children < 10 years (p= 0.02) and ossicular chain resorption (p= 0.04). Post-operative ABG â¤ 25 dB was seen in 53% of CWUT against 18% of CWDT (p= 0.04). Conclusion: CWUT is the optimal management technique offering better hearing results, however, prevention of recurrences are considered to be better with CWDT. Â© 2015.

T1  - Usefulness of the attic reconstruction using the tragal cartilage and perichondrium for prevention of a retraction pocket
AB  - Background and Objectives: Bone defect of the attic wall is a critical cause of the postoperative retraction pocket after canal wall up mastoidectomy. So, proper treatment of the attic defect is important and attic reconstruction is an acceptable procedure but it is controversial when the attic is reconstructed or not. The aim of this study is to analyze the usefulness of the attic reconstruction using tragal cartilage and perichondrium for prevention of retraction pocket and propose the indication to perform the attic reconstruction. Subjects and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 46 consecutive patients who underwent tympanomastoidectomy and attic reconstruction using tragal cartilage between January 2005 and January 2009. The follow-up period varied from 12 to 65 months, with the average period of 34 months. We analyzed postoperative status of the scutum and the tympanic membrane, and development of the residual or recurrent cholesteatomas and evaluate development of the retraction pocket according to the preoperative size of the bony defect of the scutum and status of the ossicular chain. Results: Retraction pocket was developed in the 13% of the operations and most of the cases had large attic destruction more than 3 mm and destructed ossicular chain. Conclusions: Attic reconstruction using tragal cartilage is a simple method to repair the bony defect of the external ear canal and effective in preventing postoperative retraction pocket if the size of destructed scutum is less than 3 mm.

T1  - Result of mastoid obliteration according to the graft materials: Autogenous bone, allogeneic bone, hydroxylapatite
AB  - Objective: Outcomes of surgery for otitis media and cholesteatoma according to the graft materials for mastoid obliteration were compared, and their compatibility as mastoid obliteration materials was examined. Materials and Methods: Among patients performed mastoid obliteration during the first surgery or revision for otitis media or cholesteatoma from January 2007 to April 2010, 191 patients, 196 ears, whose follow-up observation period was longer than 6 months were selected. The male was 72 patients (74 ears), and the female was 119 patients (122 ears). The age distribution was 9 - 78 years, and the mean age was 45.5 years. The follow-up observation period was average 15 months. Used for mastoid obliteration surgery were autogenous bone, allogeneic bone and hydroxylapatite (HA) and we divided patients into three groups according to graft materials. The rate of graft failure and complications were examined. Complications were divided into mastoid and tympanic cavity complications. Results: The rate of graft failure in HA group was highest in both CWU and CWD surgery. In autogenous bones group was 0.8%, which was lowest and allogeneic bone group, it was 3.1%, and good results comparable to autogenous bone group. In regard to mastoid and tympanic cavity complication, HA group also showed highest rate (10% and 16.7% respectively). Conclusion: In mastoid obliteration, HA was high rate of graft failure and complications. Thus it was determined to be not compatible any more. In contrast, allogeneic bone hardly induced problems comparable to autogenous bone. Therefore, it is judged that for cases whose autogenous bone for mastoid obliteration is not sufficient or available, allogeneic bones could be used as safe substitute materials.

T1  - Eigthteen years tympanoplasty with autogenous ear cartilage and palisade epitympano-, antrum-mastoidplasty
AB  - We use our palisade cartilage technique in all types of plasties-meanwhile in more than 6000 cases. Multiple parallel pieces of cartilage achieve the normal shape of the drum or the auditory canal and prevent later torsion of the graft. Autogenous cartilage is used from the auricle and from the tragus (1962). The use of cartilage from the auricle results in: a) Removal of much larger pieces of cartilage than could possibly be taken from the tragus. b) A consequent enlargement of the endaural canal without any cosmetic alteration provided a correct technique is employed. c) Lastly the cartilage not used is preserved in a cartilage bank for large mastoid (1962-1967) plasties or closure of small perforations in the consulting room (1977). New techniques are developed with cartilage:Anulus-stapes-plate (1962) for replacement of the body and the function of the incus preventing adhesion to the promontory. The plate collects the movements of one radius of the new drum as the handle of the malleus does under normal conditions. Tunnelplasty (1964-1967) keeping open the tubal entrance also in cases with poor tubal function and preserving the tympano meatal niche. Epitympanum-antrum-plasty (1962-1967) with aeration of the antrum. Columella-tunnel-plasty(1970). Tunnel-TORP-plasty. Mastoid-obliteration-plasty (1962-1967). We see no advantage of airing a drilled out mastoid. Histologic examinations show preservation of cartilage cells 12 years after transplantation of autogenous ear cartilage. An expanding postoperative cholesteatoma will press the cartilage graft into the external auditory canal, whereas after osteoplasty of the endaural canal wall the patient runs to an uncertain percentage the same risk as before the operation.

T1  - Pre and intraoperative findings of chronic otitis media
AB  - Chronic otitis media (COM) is still highly prevalent in developing countries and often become main cause of deafness and morbid complication. Appropriate management may decrease the morbidity and mortality rate. The aim of the study are to evaluate preoperative and intraoperative finding among COM patients. A descriptive study was conducted at Mohammad Hoesin Hospital Palembang from April 2015 to April 2018. A secondary data was taken from medical records. A total of 252 patients were included in this study with the highest incidence was at 21-30 years old group (29,36 %) with male predominance. The most frequent preoperative assessment were total perforation of tympanic membrane in 104 patients (41.26 %), moderately severe mixed hearing loss in 61 patients (24,2%), and mastoiditis with cholesteatoma in computed tomography (CT) finding in 158 patients (62,69 %). In intraoperative finding, there were 202 patients (80,15%) with cholesteatoma whereas 103 patients (40,87 %) with granulation tissue. Ossicular chain destruction were found in 141 patients (55,95 %). Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy (CWD) were performed in 190 patients (75,39 %). The prevalence of COM with cholesteatoma at Mohammad Hoesin hospital is still high. Operative management using CWD technique is preferred in cases of COM with cholesteatoma.

T1  - A case in which cochlear reimplantation was repeated thrice due to electrode exposure and cholesteatoma formation
AB  - Although cholesteatoma is a rare complication of cochlear implantation, special attention to the possibility of this complications needs to be paid especially in cases with breach of the canal wall. A female patient with congenital hearing loss received her first cochlear implantation by the canal wall down procedure at the age of three at another hospital. She visited our hospital for the first time at the age of 11 years. CT exami-naton revealed a lack of full insertion, and it was difficult to improve programming due to facial nerve stimulation. Nine years after the first implantation, we performed a repeat cochlear implantation by canal wall reconstruction. Three years after the second surgery, cholesteatoma developed in relation to the posterior wall of the external ear canal with the exposure of the electrode array to the canal. A third cochlear implantation with cholesteatoma removal was required three years after the second surgery. Seven years after the third surgery, the cholesteatoma recurred at the same place, with gradual worsening of speech recognition, and the patient needed a fourth cochlear implantation. The standard approach for cochlear implantation is the transmastoid and posterior tympanotomy approach. Sometimes, the transcanal approach needs to be selected to obtain sufficient working space for cochleostomy, however, breaching of the canal wall or the canal wall down procedure with canal reconstruction is associated with an increased risk of formation of cholesteatoma. Appropriate canal reconstruction is necessary to prevent secondary cholesteatoma formation. Surgeons should understand the potential risk of cholesteatoma formation as a long-term complication in patients with cochlear implant (CI). The patient had never used a hearing aid for the other ear since the first cochlear implantation. If she had had bilateral CIs or a hearing aid on the other side, cochlear implantation on the other side could have been chosen. Bilateral cochlear implantation is important to keep open the possibility in future, especially in children. Â© 2019 Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Middle ear mucosal regenerative therapy
AB  - Recurrence of cholesteatoma is mainly caused by poor mucosal regeneration in the middle ear cavity and mastoid cavity, often associated with changes such as granulation tissue formation, which can impair gaseous exchange in the middle ear cavity. If the middle ear mucosa can be preserved and rapid postoperative regeneration of the mucosa on the exposed surface of the bone can be achieved after middle ear surgery, the efficacy of surgical treatment for otitis media, including cholesteatoma, would potentially improve, and the physiological functions of the middle ear could be restored. Conventional canal wall-up tympanoplasty often results in a lack of mucosal regeneration in the resected area of the mastoid cavity, and changes such as granulation tissue formation often occur. In particular, it is extremely difficult to obtain mucosal regeneration in a poorly pneumatized mastoid cavity. To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel method combining canal wall-up tympanoplasty and autologous nasal mucosal epithelial cell sheet transplantation to promote postoperative regeneration of the middle ear mucosa. We obtained the approval of the ethics committee of our institution and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for this clinical research. In our novel surgical technique, we endoscopically removed an approximately 10 Ã10 mm area of nasal mucosal tissue from the inferior concha. Tissue-engineered autologous nasal mucosal epithelial cell sheets were fabricated by culturing the harvested cells using keratinocyte culture medium (KCM) containing autologous serum for 26 days in an aseptic environment in a good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compliant cell processing facility (CPF). The cultivated cell sheets were transplanted during canal wall-up tympanoplasty onto the exposed bony surface of the attic of the tympanic and mastoid cavities where the mucosa was lost. We have performed this procedure on four patients with middle ear cholesteatoma and one patient with adhesive otitis media. All of the patients showed a favorable postoperative course, with no adverse events or complications. Â© 2018 Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - A study on semicircular canal fistula associated with otitis media cholesteatoma
AB  - We describe herein our hospitalâs treatment policy for patients with otitis media cholesteatoma associated with a semicircular canal fistula and report the test results for semicircular canal fistula sites, fistula depths, postoperative bone conduction, and hearing. All the patients had a semicircular canal fistula associated with otitis media cholesteatoma and underwent surgery between August 2010 and April 2016 at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Kansai Electric Hospital. The semicircular canal fistula depths were classified according to the Dornhoffer and Milewski classification as I, IIa, IIb, and III, and 17 ears with a depth classification of IIa or higher were investigated. Eleven ears were newly operated on, and the other 6 underwent re-operations. All the re-operated ears had been previously operated on at other hospitals. In principle, a canal wall up tympanoplasty was used as the operative method, in view of the importance of the patientsâ postoperative quality of life. In all the cases, fistula treatment was conducted in a one-stage operation as the final step of the operation, and the fistula was covered with a piece of thinly sliced cartilage. The fistula sites were the external semicircular canal in 15 ears and the external semicircular canal plus the anterior semicircular canal and external semicircular canal plus the posterior semicircular canal in 1 ear each. The fistula depths were IIa, IIb and III in 11, 2 and 4 ears, respectively. Decreased postoperative bone conduction was observed in 5 (29.4%) of the 17 ears that were examined; the decrease in bone conduction in these 5 ears was within the range of 15 dB. Hearing was improved in 9 (56.3%) of the 16 evaluable ears; 1 ear was not evaluable. Postoperative dry eardrums were confirmed in all 17 ears. Severe postoperative reductions in bone conduction can be prevented by careful and appropriate fistula treatment. Â© 2018 Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Tips for and usefulness of the canal wall-up technique for surgical removal of cholesteatoma
AB  - This report provides detailed guidelines for the surgical removal of a cholesteatoma using the canal wall-up (CWU) method. Five techniques for the CWU method are available to reduce the risk of complications and development of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. (1) The operation method must be decided prior to the operation by reference to computed-tomographic images. (2) The cholesteatoma membrane must be pushed out from the back and removed en bloc. (3) Two communication routes between the tympanic cavity and mastoid antrum (an anterior and a posterior route) must be created to provide a wide surgical field. (4) A transcanal endoscope must be used to approach the cholesteatoma around the field of the tympanic sinus. (5) A 1/2 to 1/3 filleted cartilage must be used for scutumplasty or tympanoplasty. During cholesteatoma surgery, the canal wall-down (CWD) method or the canal wall reconstruction (CWR) method are sometimes used to reconstruct the external auditory meatus using soft tissue or temporal muscle tissue. These methods are appropriate if growth of the mastoid cavity is apparent or if indicated by the physical condition of the patient. However, the choice between the CWU and CWR method in terms of safety is a matter left to the judgment of the physician. If the external auditory meatus is destroyed, the CWD method must be chosen for re-operation after cholesteatoma recurrence. This greatly improves the postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) of the patients. Preservation of the external auditory meatus is extremely important, and it is imperative that every physician seeks to preserve it.

T1  - Prototype device for mastoid obliteration in pediatric cholesteatoma patients
AB  - Cholesteatoma represents a keratinization process of the middle-ear cleft or mastoid. This disease destroys the peripheral organs for hearing and balance, with possible intracranial consequences. The management of cholesteatoma is surgical and the primary aim is to remove the disease and prevent relapse. Mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of the bony external ear canal recreates the normal anatomy to avoid such morbidity. In this paper it is presented the prototype device, developed by the authors that will be inserted in the cavity. Design parameters were determined based on measurements conducted by the medical staff during mastoidectomy operations. The requirements of biomaterials used for middle ear reconstruction such as biocompatibility, surface energy, resistance to degradation and infection, mechanical stiffness, weight, bone deposition, function-appropriate design, easy to tailor and position, imaging artifact, were all taken into account and have been evaluated accordingly.

T1  - Analysis of ossicular chain-preserving tympanoplasty in cases of pars flaccida cholesteatoma
AB  - We reviewed the surgical results of ossicular chain-preserving tympanoplasty in patients with cholesteatoma, and evaluated the postoperative outcomes in terms of the hearing outcomes and risk of recurrence of cholesteatoma. This study was performed on 66 patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma who were treated by ossicular chain-preserving tympanoplasty (ossiculoplasty type I, 9 cases, type IIIr, 57 cases) from 1991 to 2015. We examined the cumulative frequency of patients who showed good hearing outcomes by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and also assessed the ventilation route from the tympanic cavity/epitympanum to the mastoid antrum. Furthermore, we examined cases with recurrent/residual cholesteatoma. The cumulative frequency of good hearing results was more than 85% in both patients treated by type I and type IIIr ossiculoplasty. However, the hearing prognosis was significantly poorer in patients who underwent type IIIr surgery, in which the incus was taken out temporarily and returned to its original position. There were blockages of the anterior and posterior ventilation routes even in patients with Stage Ib disease, which is represented by localized cholesteatoma. There were 4 cases with recurrent/residual cholesteatoma, including 2 cases of recurrent cholesteatoma and 1 case of residual cholesteatoma in the group that was treated by ossiculoplasty type I, and 1 case of recurrent cholesteatoma in the group that was treated by ossiculoplasty type IIIr. In the case of ossicular chain-preserving tympanoplasty, it is necessary to pay sufficient attention to prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma. Even if the cholesteatoma is localized, it is important to ensure the existence of sufficient ventilation by temporarily cutting the incudostapedial joint and checking behind the space of the auditory ossicle.

T1  - The role of imaging methods in diagnostic and therapeutic management of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - At the present time a closed operational technique (canal wall up - CWU) or an open technique (canal wall down - CWD with canal wall reconstruction or mastoid cavity obliteration in the treatement of middle ear cholesteatoma is preferred. Due to relatively high risk of residual and/or reccurent disease, a control, second-look operation is indicated. Majority of patients are yet free of the disease, and thus exposed to unnecessary operational risks. Therefore, less invasive imaging methods for the detection of recidivous cholesteatoma are investigated. Lately, magnetic resonance (MR) with high predictive value has overcome previously used high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This paper presents a brief review of imaging methods possibilities in the diagnosis of primary cholesteatoma, as well as its postoperative recidivism. The abilities of HRCT and especially importance of new MR methods, like delayed postcontrast imaging (DPI), convetional echo- planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (non-EPI DWI) are discussed. Non-EPI DWI technique has the main contribution in assesement of postoperative changes and potentional cholesteatoma recidivism, thereby is preferred nowadays.

T1  - Some considerations on congenital middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Congenital cholesteatomas (CCs) are white mass lesions in the middle ear arising from keratinizing squamous epithelium behind the intact tympanic membrane. CCs are characterized by invasive growth and osteolytic activity. The pathogenesis of CCs is unclear. CCs are estimated to account for 1-5% of all middle ear cholesteatomas. Along with improvement of office-based tools used for otologic examinations (i.e., otomicroscopy, lightening, and photodocumentation), detection of CCs among otolaryngologists and pediatricians has increased in recent years. To date, no conservative treatment for CCs has proven to be effective, except for treatment of secondary infection. The only effective treatment for CCs is therefore surgery. CCs are some surgical techniques, for example, intact canal wall mastoidectomy and canal wall down mastoidectomy using microscopy, and transcanal endoscopic ear surgery. Postoperative issues related to the effects of deafness and recurrence can have social, educational, and behavioral consequences.

T1  - A case of external auditory canal stenosis due to temporal bone fibrous dysplasia
AB  - Fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone (FDTB) is a rare clinical entity, the most common clinical manifestations of which are conductive hearing loss and secondary ear canal cholesteatoma caused by stenosis of the external auditory canal (EAC). Surgical intervention is appropriate in cases with functional deficits (such as conductive hearing loss) or complications (such as secondary cholesteatoma formation), however, postoperative re-stenosis of the EAC is observed at a high frequency. We present the case of a patient with FDTM in whom, despite canalplasty being performed four times during childhood, the lesion was slowly progressive and re-stenosis occureed 20 years after the last surgery. The female patient presented to our hospital with conductive hearing loss and canal cholesteatoma caused by stenosis of the EAC at the age of 40 years. Canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy and canalplasty were performed, and the extended ear canal was covered with normal bone paste and the temporalis fascia. Because FDTB is a slowly progressive benign bone lesion, complete resection is not necessary, however, a canal wall down approach with tympanomastoidectomy is recommended in cases in which the lesion extends into the middle ear and mastoid cavity.

T1  - A study on secondary acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - This study was designed to analyze the clinical features of patients who underwent surgery in Seirei Hamamatsu General Hospital for secondary acquired cholesteatoma (SAC). The subjects were 19 patients (19 ears) who underwent surgery for SAC in our hospital from 2001 to 2013. We investigated the age distribution and sex in SAC compared with primary cholesteatoma. There were 6 males (31.6%) and 13 females (68.4%), with a mean age of 55.9 (Â±19.8) years. SAC had high incidence in elder women compared with primary cholesteatoma. However, in only 2 cases, SAC was seen in children who had a history of insertion of a tympanic ventilation tube. We indicated the history of surgery as one of risk factors of SAC. Based on the site and pattern of invasion of the tympanic membrane (TM) epidermis, the cholesteatoma was classified into two types. The types were the perforation type where the epidermis invaded from the edge of the perforation, and the malleus manubrium type where the epidermis invaded from around the malleus manubrium to the promontory. The TM perforation was smaller in size in the perforation type compared with the malleus manubrium type. The extent of cholesteatoma invasion and destruction of the surrounding tissues were severe in the malleus manubrium type. The canal wall down tympanoplasty with a canal reconstruction procedure was adopted in all cases. The postoperative hearing improvement rate was 83.3% in the perforation type and 88.9% in the malleus manubrium type. There were no cases of recurrence of the cholesteatoma. The pathogenesis of SAC still remains unknown, which is clearly different from that of other types of cholesteatoma, so it is important to elucidate the mechanisms.

T1  - Case of cholesteatoma after radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma
AB  - Introduction: This is the first report about a radiation therapy-induced cholesteatoma of the middle ear in case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma after nine years from oncological treatment. Method: A patient with an undifferentiated nasopharynx carcinoma T2N2cM0 treated nine years ago underwent a canal wall down mastoidectomy with type IV tympanoplasty for an attic-antral cholesteatoma with bone erosion. Results: There was no sign of recurrence after 18 months postoperative. Conclusion: The pathologically patent-patulous-Eustachian tube could lead to chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma many years after external beam RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

T1  - Comparative study of cavity management in post mastoidectomy cases
AB  - With the refinements in canal wall down mastoidectomy in the past century, Mastoidectomy obliteration techniques have gained popularity. A randomized case control study was conducted to determine the efficacy of primary mastoid obliteration in controlling persistent ear discharge, in patients with CSOM with or without cholesteatoma. In case group, 10 patients underwent mastoidectomy with primary mastoid obliteration using a bone pÃ¢tÃ© taken from healthy skull bone near the mastoid cavity. Control group considered of 50 patients with similar operations without mastoid obliteration, who were treated conservatively and kept under observation for 3 months. On analysis of data, it was determined that there was a significantly lower incidence of discharging ear and early drying of cavities in the mastoid obliteration group. However, audiological status did not reveal any significant variation between the two groups.

T1  - External ear canal reconstruction in patients with radical mastoidectomy
AB  - Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma is still an important subject. Canal wall up (closed), canal wall down (open) and the obliterative cavity techniques are the offered procedures for the surgery of the chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Despite the advantages of preserving the normal anatomy and hearing ability, the risk of recurrence of cholesteatoma and revision mastoidectomy is high in the canal wall down procedures. In the open techniques, cavity care and the hearing impaiment are the problems, but the risk of the of the recurrence of cholesteatoma is lower. In recent years, reconstruction of the hearing is as important as the cholesteatoma n choronic otitis media surgery. However, for the recontruction of the hearing and to save the trouble of cavity care, one must create a cavity which is small, dry and restored as much as possible. In this study our goal was to get a cavity which is dry, smal and together with epithelized EAC in our cases For this purpose in GATA HaydarpaÅa training hospital between 1997 and 2000. We performed radical mastoidectomy + external auditory canal reconstruction(EAC) + mastoid cavity obliteration operation to 12 kronik otitis media patients with cholesteatoma..We followed up these patients postoperatily* for 12-36 mouth (ort 19.9)*. In all of our cases; at the end of first month in 3 cases,at the end of third month in 5 cases, at the end of sixth month in 9 cases and at the end of one year in 11 cases we got dry and epithelized EAC. In one case because dirty smelling ear discharge which is not responding to treatment we performed revision mastoidectomy and defected recurrent cholesteatoma filling middle ear in fourteenth month. At the same time bone graft which we used for EAC was resorbed. We concluded that, during eadical mastoidectomy operations, reconstruction of the EAC via using cortical bone grafting and obliteration of the mastoid cavity via using the temporal muscle is effective against the cavity problem and helps inmaintaining hearing reconstruction compared to the open techniques.

T1  - A Study on Recurrence of Middle Ear Cholesteatoma after a Canal Wall Down Tympanoplasty with Soft-wall Reconstruction
AB  - We performed revision tympanoplasty on 10 patients with recurrent cholesteatoma in the past two years between May 2011 and April 2013. Four of 10 patients with recurrent cholesteatoma were operated on using a canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction as the initial surgery. We report herein on two representative cases of recurrent cholesteatoma in whom a canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction was initially performed. In the first case, an 11-year-old female child had repeated mucopurulent otorrhea from her left ear one year after the second planned staged tympanoplasty. The canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction was performed as second surgery. Otoscopic finding revealed recurrent cholesteatoma from the attic to a part of the mastoid cavity, protruding through the scutum and posterior wall defect. CT of the temporal bone showed soft tissue from the attic to the mastoid cavity with a bone defect of scutum and posterior canal wall. We diagnosed recurrent cholesteatoma after the canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction, and performed revision surgery. In the second case, a 10-year-old male child was suffering from purulent otorrhea from his right ear approximately one year after a canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction. Otoscopic finding revealed recurrent cholesteatoma that had eroded the scutum to invade the attic. The bone defect extended from the attic to more than half of the posterior canal wall. CT showed soft tissue from the attic to the mastoid cavity with a balloon-like retraction of the posterior canal wall. Finally we performed revision surgery for a recurrent cholesteatoma which had occurred after soft-wall reconstruction of the posterior canal wall. We consider that the soft-wall reconstruction for the purpose of simplifying the surgical procedure should be avoided. We had better preserve the posterior canal wall as much as possible when operating on children. Furthermore, when operating on children the long-term prognoses must always be considered.

T1  - Our strategy of tympanoplasty for better patient QOL after surgery
AB  - We have recently taken patient postoperative QOL into consideration together with hearing outcomes and the cholesteatoma recurrence rate, and would like to introduce our strategy for better postoperative QOL in this review. 1. It is not necessary to shave hair behind the ear. 2. It is recommended to remove packing in the ear canal a few weeks postoperatively and to keep the ear canal free of gauze. 3. The first surgical option for chronic perforated otitis media is a simple underlay myringoplasty with fibrin glue. 4. It is not necessary to perform mastoidectomy in patients with chronic perforated otitis media. 5. Simple surgical methods for primary cholesteatoma are desirable to prepare for recurrence of cholesteatoma. 6. Planned canal wall up method and atticotomy/scutumplasty are recommended for busy businessmen with attic cholesteatoma in order to achieve a dry ear canal quickly and reduce the incidence of postoperative visits to an outpatient clinic. 7. After the CO 2 laser was introduced into stapes surgery in my department to cut the posterior and/or anterior crus, stapedotomies have been easily performed and patients have rarely complained of vertigo or dizziness postoperatively.

T1  - Paediatric cholesteatoma: Experience of universiti kebangsaan malaysia medical centre
AB  - Introduction: Cholesteatoma is an aggressive disease and its management poses a greater challenge in children than in adults. This study reviews the experience of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre in the clinical presentation and management outcome of acquired cholesteatoma in paediatrics that required surgical interventions. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of case records of patients below 18 years old who underwent surgery from 1999 to 2010. Results: A total of 46 patients presented with 53 cases of cholesteatoma in which seven patients had bilateral disease. The age of presentation ranged from four to 18 years old with a mean age of 12 years. Male and female patients were 65% and 35% respectively. Otorrhoea or previous history of otorrhoea on presentation was found in 94% and 96% of them had hearing impairment. Cerebellopontine angle abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis and mastoiditis were among the complications. Tympanic membrane was retracted in 64% while 47% having had attic retraction and 53% had total atelectasis. A majority (85%) underwent canal wall down surgery with or without tympanoplasty. Post-operatively, 71% had improvement or preserved hearing level. The duration of follow up ranged from one month to 13 years and a quarter had recurrent disease and underwent revision surgeries. Conclusion: Majority of the cholesteatoma patients suffered from hearing loss and otorrhoea. Tympanic membrane retraction remained the most common clinical finding. Hence, children with persistent otorrhoea after adequate treatment may represent cholesteatoma. Surgical options of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures have equal risk of recurrence.

T1  - Late results of cholesteatoma surgery in children
AB  - Introduction: Cholesteatoma in children is considered more aggressive than in adults. The aim of an otosurgeon is to remove cholesteatoma safely and completely and at the same time to preserve anatomy and physiology of the ear. Material and methods: We are evaluating a group of 38 cholesteatomas in the children who were operated at ORLCHHK in RuÅ¾omberok in 1996-2006. The patients have been monitored to show in what extent the eradication of cholesteatoma, audiological results as well as tympanoplasty have been successful. Results: By canal wall up (CWU) technique, 29 ears were operated on and canal wall down (CWD) technique was used in 3 ears. 6 ears did not require antrotomy and/or antromastoidectomy and they were resolved by cleaning tympanic sinus and/ or atticus. We detected recurrent cholesteatoma in 17 ears (45 %). We re-operated in 4 cases because of unsatisfactory result of tympanoplasty. 42 % ears were without failure of hearing postoperatively, and decrease aier-bone gap (ABG) to 20 dB was recorded in 21 % ears. We evaluated ABG 25-40 dB in 37 % ears. There have been no records of ABG more than 40 dB postoperatively. Conclusion: Nowadays, surgery of cholesteatoma is not only about safety and radical removal of pathological tissue. Functional, minimal invasive surgery is optimal, which enables preservation of most of the original structures and thus it offers the best conditions for reconstruction.

T1  - Otologic surgery
AB  - Otologic surgery encompasses a wide variety of surgical procedures with the main goals being elimination of chronic or acute ear infections and/or restoration of hearing. The various types of otologic procedures can best be divided based on the anatomic location of the disease or impairment. Working from lateral to medial, the external auditory canal (EAC) is the first landmark which can be subject to injury; this is followed by the tympanic membrane, then the middle ear space, and finally the inner ear. External Auditory Canal â EAC stenosis is an infrequent but challenging problem often found as a result of previous surgery or as an idiopathic phenomenon in the immunocompromised patient. A stenotic canal prevents adequate evaluation of the tympanic membrane; cerumen impacted deep to the stenosis often creates hearing impairment as well. A canaloplasty, which involves remodeling the EAC to widen its lumen, is the surgery of choice for this problem. Tympanic membrane â Perforation of the tympanic membrane is a relatively common finding and can often be dealt with asymptomatically for decades in certain patients. However, a majority of patients will suffer either persistent ear drainage or hearing loss as a result of a perforation. Subsequently, a tympanoplasty can be performed. A tympanoplasty uses autologous tissue, either temporalis fascia or perichondrium, as a graft to replace the injured tympanic membrane. Middle ear space â A cholesteatoma is a benign but destructive and expanding growth of keratinizing squamous epithelium, which can fill the middle ear space and cause hearing loss and ear drainage. While this is the most common mass found in the middle ear, other etiologies such as a glomus tumor or even malignant carcinomas can be identified here. A mastoidectomy is the surgery of choice for removal of these tumors, especially if they extend into the mastoid bone. A canal-wall up mastoidectomy keeps the EAC intact and allows the mastoid to drain through the middle ear in the usual fashion, while a canal-wall down mastoidectomy (used for more severe disease) exteriorizes the mastoid cavity through an enlarged EAC.

T1  - Lateralization of the epithelium due to false epithelial migration within open mastoidectomy cavities
AB  - Two patients who had been previously treated with radical mastoidectomy procedure were found to have an abnormal small cavity due to a soft, tumor like tissue obstructing the entrance of mastoidectomy cavity on follow-up examination. These tissues were easily perforated by simple instrumentation and observed to be an epithelium with varying thickness. Histologic examination revealed granulation tissue composed of cholesterol clefts, multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes beneath keratinized squamous epithelium. Open mastoid cavity remains a problem for some patients due to recurrence of inflammatory processes, persistent ear discharge, wax accumulation, fungal infection and granulation tissue formation, requirement of regular medication. In this report, we describe another open cavity problem, lateralization of epithelium due to false migration which may occur after canal wall down mastoidectomy. It may decrease hearing and misleadingly seem like a tumor or a naturally narrowed cavity. Furthermore, it may hide some pathologies like cholesteatoma recurrence. We think that this problem is the result of false epithelial migration probably over a blood clot which was not cleansed due to poor postoperative care.

T1  - Prognostic factors of chronic otitis Part 3 - Postoperative factors
AB  - The retrospective study in 155 patients surgically treated for chronic otitis media followed and statistically evaluated the state of hearing before and after the operation according to individual postoperative observed symptoms. The significant negative postoperative prognostic factors for the state of hearing should include present secretion from the ear (trepanation cavities) in a long-term observation and present postoperative consequences (conductive, sensori neural hearnig IaSS and vertigo). The non-significant factors include the present secretion in the course of early healing after the operation and postoperatively present granulations in the trepanation cavity. The authors also compared early healing and the long-term state of the ear (trepanation cavities) according to individual preoperative and perioperative characteristics. A more frequent secretion from the ear in the course of early and long-term observation was detected in patients with cholesteatoma, perforation of tympanic, membrane defects of all middle ear ossicles, permanent secretion before the operation, revision operation, less usual plasty of external auditory came (Stacke I, three-lobar), resection of mastoid process and obliteration of trepanation cavity by less usual materials - bone or cartilage.

T1  - Otologic surgery
AB  - Otologic surgery encompasses a wide variety of surgical procedures involving the ear with the goal of eliminating infection and/or restoring hearing. Chronic drainage from the ear suggests a tympanic membrane perforation or cholesteatoma (benign squamous keratocyst) of the middle ear or mastoid. Tympanoplasty (repair of tympanic membrane perforation) usually uses autologous temporalis fascia or perichondrium and may be combined with mastoidectomy, of which there are two types, when inflammatory disease or cholesteatoma extends into the mastoid. In canal-wall-up mastoidectomy, the external auditory canal is kept intact and the mastoid cavity drains through the middle ear as is normally the case. Canal-wall-down mastoidectomy is used for more severe disease and exteriorizes the mastoid cavity through an enlarged external meatus. Reconstructive surgery for hearing-ossicular reconstruction and stapedotomy-is used when trauma, infection, or otosclerosis (stapedotomy) has damaged the middle ear sound conductive mechanism. Otologic procedures may be performed under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation. Muscle relaxants are avoided if cranial nerve monitoring is needed intraoperatively. Most otologic procedures are accomplished in one to four hours. Significant blood loss and/or transfusion are not expected. Usual postoperative course: Expected postoperative hospital stay: Most otologic surgery is performed as an outpatient or ambulatory inpatient procedure with 23-hour observation. Operative mortality: Equals the anesthetic risk. Special monitoring required: Since the surgical field is in close proximity to the facial nerve, muscle relaxants are avoided so that facial activity may be monitored intraoperatively.

T1  - Surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma with down's syndrome
AB  - We reported 6 surgically-treated cases of middle ear cholesteatoma associated with Down's syndrome. The following points were considered to be important during surgery for such cases : 1) the canal-wall-up technique using a postauricular incision was superior to the canal-wall-down technique, 2) the incision should be closed using the buried suture technique and 3) a fascial graft should be fixed by fibrin glue without a gauze tamponade. These points should be considered to facilitate postoperative treatment in the patients who are uncooperative.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media and its management
AB  - There are patients with bad postoperative courses after surgery for chronic otitis media, and they require revision surgery or medical treatment. The most indicative cause for revision surgery is failure in the surgical technique, recidivum and complications. An open mastoid cavity is a frequently observed complication of middle ear surgery. It is very important before performing revision surgery to know which surgical method was used in the previous operation and to understand the present pathological condition. CT and MRI can provide reliable information. In the revision surgery, we can not obtain a patient's consent for a surgical procedure without a near hundred percent certainty of a success. It would be preferable to reduce the open mastoid cavity by mastoid obliteration to avoid mastoid cavity problems and recurrent cholesteatoma. Â© 2000, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo.

T1  - Continuous drainage tube in tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration
AB  - Tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration is sometimes performed on patients with cholesteatoma or sequelae after radical middleear surgery (i.e., open cavity problem, etc.). However, long-term continuous release of an exudate from the ground bone surface, mucosa or the tissues surrounding the surgical wound may follow surgery. This results in delayed drying of the grafted tissue and has been known to cause hematoma and even subsequent infection in the retroauricular region. In this study, a continuous drainage tube was implanted subcutaneously in the retroauricular region of 17 patients who had undergone surgery for mastoid cavity obliteration, and was left in place for a number of days. As a result, drying of the surgical wound and the inner ear was achieved within a short period of time. Â© 1999, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo. All rights reserved.

T1  - Postoperative results of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma was evaluated from the point of postoperative hearing and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Of the 36 ears operated on in the previous 5 years and 5 months, intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in 27 ears, and tympanoplasty with posterior canal wall removal in 9 ears. The patients were evaluated for a follow-up period of more than 6 months after tympanoplasty. The rate of success in hearing improvement was 82.4% according to the criteria of the Japan Otological Society. Recurrence of the cholesteatoma was found in 2 ears (5.6%), which had been treated by intact canal wall tympanoplasty. A retraction pocket in the attic was found in 5 ears (17.9%), following intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Reconstruction of the attic defect with cartilage and obliteration of the mastoid cavity were useful in the prevention of postoperative retraction pocket.

T1  - Middle ear diseases from the viewpoint of gas exchange function in the mastoid
AB  - The physiology and pathophysiology of middle ear ventilation in ears with various diseases was evaluated from the perspective of gas exchange through the mucosa of mastoid air cells as well as from the perspective of eustachian tube function. 1. In 50% of patients with otitis media with effusion (OME), gas exchange function was impaired. The size of the mastoid and the presence or absence of aeration in the middle ear were closely correlated with gas exchange function. After myringotomy and removal of the effusion, gas exchange function recovered in most of the ears with impaired function. These results indicate that impairment of the gas exchange function in OME appears to be reversible, and that the surgical treatment of OME can be interpreted as being directed toward the recovery of gas exchange function. 2. In refractory OME which has not been cured before the age of 10, both eustachian tube and gas exchange functions are highly impaired. 3. Middle ear surgery involving mastoidectomy results in total abolishment of gas exchange function in the mastoid and a failure of recovery of aeration. These observations suggest that the canal-wall-down procedure is recommended, rather than the canal-wall-up procedure, after mastoidectomy to avoid the risk of unexpected sequelae, such as recurrent cholesteatoma. Mastoid obliteration is also justified after mastoidectomy in the sense that such functional dead space should be abandoned. 4. In the future of middle ear surgery, therefore, surgeons should consider minimally invasive surgery in combination with the conservative preoperative treatment which is now prevalent in nasal surgery. 5. Organic and irreversible impairment of both eustachian tube function and gas exchange function seems to be related to the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma as an ultimate outcome of these impairments in refractory OME. 6. Finally, a new concept of middle ear ventilation was proposed ; ventilation of the middle ear may be managed primarily by gas exchange function and the eustachian tube may play a key role in clearance of the middle ear rather than in ventilation.

T1  - Results of Tympanoplasty for Cholesteatoma
AB  - The results of tympanoplasty performed in 72 ears with cholesteatoma from 1988 to 1992 are analyzed. The patients were followed for 6 to 60 months (average 21.4 months). The canal down method was used in 32 ears, the canal up method in 8 ears, and posterior wall reconstruction in 32 ears. Mastoid obliteration was done in 61 ears. Staged and second look operations were performed in 19 and 14 ears, respectively. Fifteen of the 33 ears with staged or second look operations had residual cholesteatoma. Recurrence was observed in one ear treated with the canal up method and in 3 ears treated with posterior wall reconstruction. No recurrence was observed in ears treated with the canal down method. Tympanoplasty type I, type II, type II, columella type III, columella type N were performed in 8, 1, 1, 48 and 14 ears, respectively. Autologous cartilage from the auricle was used in most ears as a columella. The rate of success of hearing preservation was 82% according to the Criteria of the Japan Otological Society. There was no large difference in the rate of success of hearing preservation among the ears treated with the canal down method, canal up method and posterior wall reconstruction.

T1  - Late onset facial nerve paralysis after fracture of the skull base
AB  - Late onset facial nerve paralysis caused by post-traumatic cholesteatoma is a rare but serious complication of fracture of the skull base. Unless careful follow-up is maintained patient may come with extensive disease even many years later. Since post-traumatic cholesteatoma is invasive and occurs in a well pneumatised mastoid it is large and extensive. In our patient it involved the labyrinth and caused a permanent facial nerve paralysis. Surgical management involves eradicating the cholesteatoma with a canal wall down technique.

T1  - One-Stage Tympanoplasty and Mastoid Obliteration for Cholesteatoma Otitis Media
AB  - One-stage tympanoplasty and mastoid obliteration for cholesteatoma otitis media was performed in 37 ears from November, 1988 through December, 1991. Twenty three received modified type III tympanoplasty for 17 attic type and 6 pars tensa type cholesteatomas, and 14 had modified type Â¥ tympanoplasty for 4 attic type and 10 pars tensa type cholesteatomas. A part of the posterior ear canal wall was removed for direct visualization of the cholesteatoma. After complete removal of the cholesteatoma, the mastoid cavity was obliterated with bone chips and cartilage, with bone chips, Palva's flap and cartilage, or with Palva's flap and cartilage. Postoperative hearing was good in 20/23 ears (87.0%) after modified type HI tympanoplasty, and in 6/14 ears (42.9%) after modified type Â¥ tympanoplasty. Good results were obtained in 18/21 (85.7%) of those with attic type cholesteatomas and in 8/16 (50.0%) of those with pars tensa cholesteatomas. Cholesteatomas recurred in 0/23 ears (0%) after modified type III tympanoplasty and in 2/14 ears (14.3%, pars tensa type) after modified type Â¥ tympanoplasty. These findings suggest that one-stage tympanoplasty and mastoid obliteration is useful, especially for attic type cholesteatomas. Â© 1994, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Evaluation of surgical therapy and postoperative results for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical findings and results in 115 cases of middle ear cholesteatoma were analyzed. In 21 cases of planned staged tympanoplasty, residual cholesteatoma was found in 43% at the second-stage of surgery. In 94 cases of one-stage tympanoplasty, residual or recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 6%. Attic retraction pocket which was considered a precurser of recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 23% during the postoperative course. To avoid a residual cholesteatoma and to maintain the original shape of the external auditory canal, cholesteatoma should be removed by an open-and-closed method in one-stage tympanoplasty. However, staged tympanoplasty is recommended in difficult cases. Furthermore, mastoid obliteration is useful to avoid recurrent cholesteatoma and attic retraction pocket. In cases that were followed for more than 6 months, hearing improvement (postoperative hearing level within 40 dB or an Air-Bone gap within 20 dB or hearing gain over 15 dB) was obtained in 91% for type III and 43% for type IV. The incus, malleus, cartilage and plastipore PORP were used as columella materials in type III tympanoplasty and good hearing results were obtained with all of them. In type IV tympanoplasty, good hearing results were obtained by plastipore TORP. The extrusion rate of PORP and TORP was 29%. It was concluded that more effective means for preventing extrusion of columella are necessary, and that the use of PORP and TORP should be restricted especially in cases with severe middle ear lesions.

T1  - Surgical Treatment of Chronic Otitis Media in Children
AB  - The longterm results of tympanoplasty were analyzed in 53 ears of children aged 4 to 15 years with chronic otitis media. A canal-up type I tympanoplasty was employed to 34 ears with non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis (25 granulating otitis and 9 adhesive otitis). The rate of primary graft take (success rate of closing perforation) was 91% and the hearing results were satisfactory. The overall success rates were similar among all age groups. Consequently, tympanoplasty can be recommended in children of all ages, including preschool age. Regarding initial surgery in 15 ears with cholesteatoma, an extensive cholesteatoma filling the entire air-cell area was found in 5 ears (33%) and cholesteatoma spreading into the middle ear cleft was found in 11 ears (73%). Despite a large number of cases with active and rapidly growing cholesteatoma, complications from cholesteatoma in children were relatively low. In our series, only one case developed a complication due to wide exposure of the facial nerve. Thirteen cases with cholesteatoma extending into the attic or mastoid were treated by canal wall down procedures with canal reconstruction or mastoid obliteration. Six cases with cholesteatoma restricted to the middle ear space were treated with canal wall up procedures. At the latest follow-up ranging 4 to 52 months (average 24.5 months) after surgery, all cases were dry and maintained good anatomic results without recurrence. From these results, surgical procedures for cholesteatoma in children should be selected according to the extent of the lesion as in adults. Â© 1993, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Mastoid Cavity Problems after Cholesteatoma Surgery
AB  - Mastoid cavity problems were studied in 113 ears that had the posterior canal wall removed during surgery (open tympanoplasty, radical mastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy) for middle ear cholesteatoma. Posterior canal wall reconstruction with mastoid obliteration was performed in 19 ears, mastoid obliteration only in 10 ears, and no treatment for the open mastoid cavity in 84 ears. The total incidence of mastoid cavity problems was 30.1%. Aural discharge was most frequently observed (24.8%). Other problems included postoperative development of mastoid air cells, cholesteatoma or cyst formation, the absorption of the reconstructed canal wall, and mycosis. Cavity problems were more frequently observed in the groups with reconstruction or obliteration because of the absorption of those materials. Patients under 9 years old frequently had cavity problems, and additional surgery was performed in 44.1%. Preservation of the canal wall is most important in preventing the cavity problems, and firm obliteration of the open mastoid cavity with bone tissue or ceramics is necessary in patients that have the canal wall removed.

T1  - Cholesterol Granuloma of the Middle Ear in a Patient with Middle Ear Malformation
AB  - Cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear is frequently observed in patients with otitis media with effusion but has never been reported in a patients with middle ear malformation. Our patient, a 21-year-old woman, had severe middle ear cholesterol granuloma extending from the mastoid cells to the eardrum and through the epitympanum, mesotym-panum, and hypotympanum. Early operation was required to rule out neoplasms, such as glomus tumor ; venous anomaly ; and cholesteatoma, since the initial symptoms were rapidly deteriorating hearing ability with continuous bloody ear discharge. The malleus head and incus body were located near the aditus ad antrum, and the chorda tympanic nerve, which is usually located between the malleus handle and the long process of the incus, was anomalously located across the middle tympanic cavity. The severe cholesterol granuloma was considered to have arisen from bleeding from a small vein near the chorda tympanic nerve, narrowed aditus ad antrum combined with the anomalous locations of the malleus head and incus body, and disturbed function of the auditory tube with otitis media with effusion. This severe cholesterol granuloma was treated with intact canal wall staged tympanoplasty of type III with mastoid obliteration. Â© 1992, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Cholesteatoma; A Clinical Study of 104 Patients
AB  - The clinical features and postoperative course of 104 cases of cholesteatoma were analyzed statistically. Cholesteatoma was categorized as PF (pars flaccida), PSQ (posterosuperior quadrant) or central type. One stage surgery was performed on 44 ears (57.7%) of the PF type and on 16 ears of the PSQ type (61.5%). Canal wall-up operation was performed on 37 ears of the PF (48.7%) and 15 ears of the PSQ type (57.7%). Only 16 ears underwent canal down operations. Columella III type tympanoplasty was most frequently (37.5%) performed for ossicular chain reconstruction. The overall rate of improvement of hearing was 63.2%. Postoperatively 44.7% of the patients showed abnormal appearance of the ear drum, such as retraction pocket, adhesions or otorrhea. Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in 17 ears of the PF type and in 2 ears of the PSQ type. Cholesteatomas extending from the aditus through the mastoid cavity showed a high rate of recurrence. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 21.4% of all ears. In general, ears without otorrhea had better postoperative hearing than wet ears. The incidence of recurrence was especially high in wet ears of the PF type. Â© 1991, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Surgical Treatment of Cholesteatoma. âA Review of the Problem of Recurrenceâ
AB  - Since the 1960s the author has utilized intact canal wall tympanoplasty in the treatment of cholesteatoma despite the high incidence of recurrence during the developmental period of the operation, because he has believed that this procedure is the only possible way to control cholesteatoma and preserve the anatomical structures needed for the restoration of hearing and the self-cleansing function of the external ear canal. A follow-up study in 1972 revealed that in 21 of the 56 patients (41%) operated on with this procedure the cholesteatoma recurred within three years. During the 1970s the author attempted to reduce the high rate of recurrence. In 84 patients operated on with staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty during the 1980s there was a recurrence in only 12 (4.4%) three years or more after the operation. These results were due to improvements in surgical technique: removal of the matrix under better surgical view in the first stage operation, and reconstruction of the bony defect in the attic and obliteration of the mastoid cavity in the second stage operation. In spite of improvement in the surgical technique either a residual cholesteatoma or a deep retraction pocket was found during the second stage operation in 30% of the patients. This means that the rate of recurrence was still very high if a second operation was not planned. Until we have a safe and reliable method of detecting microscopic residue of the matrix, the planned staged procedure is indeed needed to reduce the risk of recurrence and to restore good function to the middle and external ear.

T1  - Results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Operative findings and results in cases of middle ear cholesteatoma were analyzed with special reference to postoperative hearing and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Of the 242 ears operated on in the past 9 years and 9 months, intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in 114 ears, tympanoplasty with the posterior canal wall removal in 81 ears, and radical mastoidectomy in 47 ears. Of the 139 ears observed for more than 6 months after tympanoplasty, postoperative hearing was improved in 34 ears (24.5%), decreased in 15 ears (9.3%) and still in the range of the preoperative level in 90 ears (66.2%). Recurrence of the cholesteatoma was found in 15 ears (6.2%), five of which had been treated by radical mastoidectomy. Though there were no such recurrences in 46 patients treated by staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty, a retraction pocket which was considered to be a precursor of cholesteatoma was found in seven cases (15.2%). In order to avoid a retraction pocket in intact canal wall tympanoplasty, closure of the attic accompanied by obliteration of the mastoid cavity is advised.

T1  - Tragal Cartilage Graft Tympanoplasty Utilized for Reoperative Procedure
AB  - Tragal cartilage graft tympanoplasty was performed on 23 ears in which previous tympanoplasties or radical mastoidectomy had been unsuccessful. The operation was limited to ears having an aerated cavity around the Eustachian tube orifice and the patent tube. There was granulation tissue with or without cholesteatoma in the athelectatic posterior half of the tympanic cavity and the mastoid. After re-exploring the mastoid cavity, all the residual air cells were eradicated using a diamond bur, and white healthy cortical bone was exposed in all dimensions of the cavity. Pathology around the stapes was cleared but the mucosa in the tympanic cavity remained untouched. The facial buttress and the bony posterior ear canal were lowered as much as possible. If superstructure of the stapes was missing, the cartilage prosthesis was placed on the footplate. The tragal cartilage was fashioned to fit the tympanic annulus anteriorly and the facial canal posteriorly and was placed to seal the tympanic cavity exactly. In five ears, the mastoid cavity was obliterated by an anterior pedicle temporalis muscle flap. The follow-up study from one to seven years confirmed that the smoothly surfaced mastoid cavity dried perfectly in all ears. There was neither adhesion nor a retraction pocket. Epithelial debris or crust was scanty. In 13 ears, postoperative hearing remained within 30 dB, and in 8 ears it improved more than 15 dB. In two ears, hearing deteriorated more than 15 dB postoperatively. Our experiences have proved that the use of the tragal cartilage is beneficial for recostruction of the middle ear in selected cases in which reoperation was required and its advantages are; (1) accessibility in the operative site, (2) availability in an adequate amount, (3) excellent contour and thickness, (4) adequate stiffness and elasticity, and (5) excellent survival capacity without producing tissue reaction and adhesion.

T1  - Results of conservative surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out to analyze treatment results for cholesteatoma at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. All patients undergoing primary surgical treatment from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1973 were followed through October 1976. Treatment failures were based on the occurrence of postoperative cholesteatoma. The probability of being disease free for periods up to five years after original surgery was then estimated for each type of operation. Postoperative cholesteatoma occurred after atticotomy in 17%, intact canal wall mastoidectomy in 35%, and modified radical mastoidectomy in 9%. The postoperative cholesteatoma rate in the group having intact canal wall mastoidectomy was more than twice as high for those patients under age nine. The likelihood of being disease free five years after intact canal wall surgery was estimated to be 36% using the life table method. Disease recurrence was significantly higher after intact canal wall surgery compared to other surgical methods. The effectiveness of this method should be evaluated in a randomized, prospective manner to minimize patient selection and treatment bias.

T1  - Role of Langerhans cells, Ki-67 protein and apoptosis in acquired cholesteatoma: prospective clinical study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Langerhans cells in the pathogenesis and clinical picture of middle-ear cholesteatoma.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 40 patients operated upon for a diagnosis of chronic otitis due to acquired cholesteatoma.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: A closed surgical technique was used in 20 per cent of patients and an open technique in 80 per cent. Langerhans cells were more densely accumulated in cholesteatoma epithelium, compared with external ear canal skin (p < 0.001). Staining for Ki-67 protein was greater in cholesteatoma epithelium (p < 0.001) and Apo2.7 protein staining (indicating apoptosis) was more prominent (p < 0.001), compared with ear canal skin. Regarding significant relationships between clinical and pathological findings, staining for Ki-67 (p = 0.046) and Apo2.7 (p = 0.037) was more prominent in patients undergoing open versus closed surgery.CONCLUSION: Using cell proliferation and apoptosis markers, a dense Langerhans cell infiltration was found to occur as a host response to middle-ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cartilage Ossiculoplasty from Stapes to Tympanic Membrane in One-Stage Intact Canal Wall Tympanoplasty for Cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report hearing results of cartilage interposition ossiculoplasty in one-stage intact canal wall (ICW) tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma with intact stapes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of pre and postoperative hearing status was conducted at a tertiary referral otologic center in a series of 61 patients having undergone one-stage ICW tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma with intact stapes and cartilage ossiculoplasty during the same procedure.RESULTS: In the preoperative period, the mean air conduction thresholds (AC), air-bone gap (ABG), and speech reception thresholds (SRT) were 35.3, 20.14, and 35.6 dB, respectively. Postoperatively, with a mean follow-up of 29 months, AC, ABG, and SRT were 27.8, 13.34, and 28.8 dB, respectively. Mean hearing gain was 6.8 dB and mean SRT improvement was 6.8 dB. Mean bone conduction thresholds for 1, 2, and 4 kHz remained stable after surgery (17.6 dB preoperatively vs. 18 dB postoperatively).CONCLUSION: Cartilage ossiculoplasty from stapes to tympanic membrane in one-stage ICW tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma is a safe, reliable, easy, and effective procedure, with no additional cost.

T1  - Mastoidectomy in noncholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media: is it necessary?
AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) without cholesteatoma, the surgical treatment of which is still controversial, is a common diagnosis in otologic practice. A retrospective analysis of 323 patients who underwent surgery for noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in the Gruppo Otologica, Piacenza, Italy, between April 1983 and December 1993 is presented. Cases were separated into three groups according to different surgical treatment modalities and conditions of the ears at the time of operation. Group I (n = 53) consisted of cases of CSOM treated by tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy (TLWOM). Group II (n = 28) included cases of CSOM treated by tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy (TLWM). Intact canal wall technique was used in these cases. The ears in both these groups were discharging severely at the time of surgery. Group III (n = 242) included patients whose ears were dry at the time of surgery but who had had previous recurrent episodes of suppuration and who were treated by TLWOM. At the last follow-up, graft success rates for groups I, II, and III were 90.5%, 85.7%, and 89.2%, respectively, and mean residual gaps were 17.2 dB, 20.1 dB, and 19.4 dB, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the three groups either on graft success rates (p > 0.05) or on final functional hearing outcome (p > 0.05). TLWM is the preferable treatment modality for most surgeons in noncholesteatomatous CSOM. Nevertheless, in our experience TLWOM yields comparable results for this group of patients. In addition, we could not find any significant difference in results of graft success and final functional hearing rates between dry and discharging ears (p > 0.05).

T1  - Combined approach tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma: impact of middle-ear endoscopy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were (1) to explore whether the experience at the Radcliffe Infirmary (Oxford, UK) supported the use of combined approach tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma, by determining the rate of disease at subsequent surgery, and (2) to assess whether this rate differed from findings reported elsewhere in the literature, possibly due to the effect of using an oto-endoscope.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review, with data entered prospectively for operations performed by a single surgeon.SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital.PATIENTS: Between January 1998 and December 2004 inclusive, 66 patients underwent 68 primary procedures, with data available for all 'second looks'.INTERVENTIONS: Diagnostic and therapeutic operations for cholesteatoma were performed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All patients in this study attended follow up and underwent a second look operation, during which the rate of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma was determined. An oto-endoscope was used at all primary and subsequent surgery.RESULTS: The mean interval between the first and second combined approach tympanoplasty procedures was 16 months, and that between the second and third such procedures was 19 months (10 patients). One patient underwent a fourth combined approach tympanoplasty procedure, 17 months after a third such procedure. The rate of cholesteatoma at second combined approach tympanoplasty was 20.6 per cent (14/68); this was judged to be residual in 10 ears (14.7 per cent) and to be recurrent, with the redevelopment of retraction pockets, in four ears (5.9 per cent). The rate of cholesteatoma at third combined approach tympanoplasty was 20 per cent (two of 10); of these two, one patient had a small pearl in the middle ear removed with the aid of a potassium titanyl phosphate laser. There was no disease present in one patient at a fourth combined approach tympanoplasty. Only four patients required a modified radical mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: Cholesteatoma remains a disease with significant morbidity. Endoscope-assisted surgery may decrease the morbidity of second look surgery and may improve the clearance of disease in appropriately selected patients.

T1  - Delayed facial nerve weakness after intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To find the etiology, frequency, and prognosis of delayed facial nerve weakness (DFW) in our department after intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy for a tubotympanic (TT) type of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) without cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: Tertiary care center.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 315 patients who underwent intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy for TT type of CSOM without cholesteatoma in our department for the past 3 years were selected. Patients with facial nerve weakness after 72 hours of surgery were noted and assessed for a history of herpes zoster virus infection. There were 6 patients who developed DFW; of these, blood samples of 4 patients for serum antibody titers to varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex type 1 were sent on the 3rd day of developing DFW. Blood samples of each of the remaining 2 patients were sent on the 13th day and 1st day of developing DFW. All 6 patients were treated with prednisolone and acyclovir, and their prognosis was assessed.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system and serum antibody titers for varicella zoster virus and herpes simplex type 1.RESULTS: Six patients (1.9%) developed DFW in this study. All patients had a history of herpes zoster virus infection. Serology results of 4 patients showed positive immunoglobulins M and G for varicella zoster virus and had significantly elevated titers of serum immunoglobulin G for varicella zoster virus, thus confirming the etiology.CONCLUSION: The incidence of DFW after tympanomastoidectomy is low and is due to viral reactivation, that is, varicella zoster. The overall prognosis seems impressive because all of the patients' facial nerve function improved by the end of 6 weeks. This study also illustrates the medicolegal importance of informing the patients with a history of herpes zoster virus infection the chance of developing DFW after undergoing tympanomastoidectomy.

T1  - Surgical management of intracranial complications of otogenic infection
AB  - We conducted a prospective study of 24 patients to evaluate the evolution of intracranial complications resulting from otogenic infection and to correlate the course of the disease with surgical treatment. Almost half of the patients were younger than 18 years, and most were male. The most common intracranial complication was brain abscess, followed by meningitis, lateral sinus thrombosis, and extradural abscess. Cholesteatoma was found in 14 patients. After the complications were confirmed by computed tomography, initial treatment consisted of intravenous systemic antibiotics followed by mastoid surgery. The surgical approach was determined by the type of ear disease, not by the type of neurologic complication. Modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 16 patients, tympanomastoidectomy in 6, and myringotomy in 2. No significant morbidity, mortality, recurrence, or residual neurologic deficit was observed at the 6-month follow-up. Early surgical intervention is important in achieving positive outcomes in patients with such intracranial complications.

T1  - Prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma: use of hydroxyapatite plates and composite grafts
AB  - Recurrent cholesteatoma after closed techniques occurs in four patterns: (1) through an attic defect, (2) via erosions in the canal wall, (3) as a pars tensa invagination, and (4) as a borderline invagination between an attic defect repair and a normal pars tensa. Semicircular porous hydroxyapatite ceramic plates 7, 10, and 14 mm in diameter, and 1 mm thick are used as underlays to repair attic defects, supplemented by bone dust pate and fine tragal cartilage-perichondrium composite grafts. Pate and either the tragal composites or fine tragal cartilage shavings are used to minimize the risk of wall erosion pockets. Borderline invaginations and pars tensa recollapse are prevented with the fine tragal composites. The extent of pars tensa reinforcement is determined by the extent of disease. Care to anticipate and prevent each of the four patterns has produced a comprehensive reduction of recurrent cholesteatoma to acceptable levels (under 10%). Residual disease, found in 19 percent of second stage cases, has required open conversion in only 3 percent of cases. The above techniques therefore provide optimal results and are recommended as routine closed cavity techniques.

T1  - Acquired cholesteatoma: classification and outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Reclassification of acquired cholesteatoma into the commonly observed presentations of this condition to provide a simple and clear grouping that indicates the pathology, management, and outcomes of the group cases.PATIENTS: Virgin acquired cholesteatoma cases from a single center managed from 1986 to 2008 (515 cases).INTERVENTIONS: Cases were managed by transcanal (20%) or intact canal wall techniques. Wall repairs successively used autograft cartilage (transcanal and early intact canal wall mastoidectomy cases), hydroxylapatite plates (1989-2007), or titanium sheeting (2007). Drum repairs used cartilage-perichondrial composite grafts. Assembly techniques were the preferred ossiculoplasty method.RESULTS: Distribution: attic, 41%; pars tensa, 45%; and combined attic-pars tensa, 14%. Unclassifiable cases (n = 14) were excluded. Contralateral disease was present in 15% and effusions in 34% during or after surgery. Cell formation was most extensive in attic disease, least in combined patterns. Ossicular pathology was worse in the collapsed drum cases. Attic cases had the best hearing outcomes but risked recurrent disease, which required precise countermeasures. Overall, the combined pattern group carried the worst prognosis.CONCLUSION: Compared with previous methods, the clinical classification proved simple, descriptive, and comprehensive. It provides a readily discerned practical basis for clinical management and research purposes.

T1  - CT scanning in "second look" combined approach tympanoplasty
AB  - One of the main disadvantages of intact canal wall mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma is the necessity of the "second look". The morbidity of a second procedure can be reduced, however, with the aid of a rigid endoscope. Fifty-five consecutive patients undergoing a re-exploration were included in this study. Prior to surgery computerized tomography (CT) was performed in order to assess both the anatomy and degree of pneumatisation of the middle ear cavity and mastoid bowl. The operative findings at the time of the "second look" were correlated with the pre-operative scans. An otoendoscopic approach was possible in all cases. In the diagnosis of residual or recurrent disease, the CT scan had a sensitivity of 43.8%. The specificity of the CT scan was 51.3%. The explanation for these findings is that it is impossible to differentiate between recurrence, scar tissue or inflammation on CT images in patients who have undergone previous mastoid surgery.

T1  - A ten year statistical follow-up of 1142 consecutive cases of cholesteatoma: the closed vs. the open technique
AB  - Cholesteatoma has long been a formidable adversary to the otologic surgeon. The surgical treatment has been basically by two methods, open and closed. It was felt that a study should be undertaken to compare the results obtained over a long period of time, utilizing these two methods. A need for this study existed as the same number of new cases of cholesteatoma was presenting each year. In reviewing the literature, it is found that new advancements have not yet been made in the prevention of the disease and the medical and surgical management has remained essentially the same. The ideal goal of successful surgery, namely an ear without disease, with normal hearing, and an intact drum and posterior canal wall, has been difficult to achieve in a high percentage of cases. To achieve this goal, two main surgical methods have evolved: the classical "open method," and the more recent "closed method. " In the open method cases, the hearing results were often poor and the cavity presented a management problem. In the closed method there has been a fairly high occurrence of residual, and/or recurrent cholesteatoma which mecessitated a second procedure. These two methods were compared by reviewing a large number of histologically proved cholesteatoma cases 10 years after surgery, to determine the incidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma and the residual hearing function. The results of this study show conclusively that the hearing was better using the closed method, but the recurrence rate was considerably higher. This paper presents a practical method of approach to the management of all presenting cases of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Evolving considerations in the surgical management of cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a contemporary, pragmatic approach to managing cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: All patients that underwent cholesteatoma surgery, having profound hearing loss in the contralateral ear.INTERVENTION(S): Cholesteatoma surgery.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Surgical strategy, preoperative and postoperative audiometric outcomes, short- and long-term complications, recidivism.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients met criteria, representing 0.25% of all chronic ear surgeries performed between 1970 and 2012. Patients undergoing surgery in the latter half of the study underwent intact canal wall procedures and ossicular chain reconstruction more frequently despite having similar severities of disease. All patients with inner ear fistula underwent an open-cavity operation. In the early postoperative period, 86% of ears had stable or improved hearing levels, and all patients maintained preoperative bone conduction thresholds. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, 79% of patients maintained stable or improved pure tone thresholds, whereas 2 subjects experienced delayed sensorineural hearing loss and 2 experienced isolated declining speech discrimination. Notably, 3 of the latter 4 patients were diagnosed with labyrinthine fistula and had undergone radical mastoidectomy. None of the patients who received an intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy experienced worsening bone conduction thresholds, whereas 1 subject demonstrated a delayed decline in speech discrimination and another recurred.CONCLUSION: It is commonly held that the radical or classic modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice when managing cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear while intact canal wall techniques are contraindicated. Over the last 20 years, we have adopted a less-rigid, functional approach favoring intact canal wall procedures in the absence of inner ear fistula rather than unequivocally committing to an open cavity. This strategy has been influenced by advancements in preoperative evaluation, increasing familiarity and refinement of closed-cavity techniques, postoperative imaging surveillance options, and the potential for cochlear implant "salvage" in the rare case of profound hearing loss. Based on the current series, this approach appears safe when performed by an experienced surgeon, and reliable long-term patient follow-up is maintained.

T1  - The surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Between 1966 and 1981, 141 cholesteatomas were operated upon in children who were 3-15 years old. Radical mastoidectomy was performed in 5 cases. Open cavity tympanoplasty was done in 3 cases. Intact canal wall technique was performed in 99 cases, with a planned second stage in 83 cases (all cholesteatoma cases since 1973). ICWT avoids a large cavity in a well pneumatized mastoid and the second stage controls residual cholesteatomas which were more frequent in children (50%) than in adults (22%). Because of multiple or large residual cholesteatomas, a third stage was performed in 3 cases. Because of a large mesotympanum and/or attic residual cholesteatoma, a transformation of ICWT to an obliteration technique was performed in 4 cases. Retraction pockets were found after the first stage in 12 cases and a transformation of ICWT to an obliteration technique was done in 8 cases at the second stage. Late retraction pockets were found after 5 years in 20% after 2 stages and in 25% after one stage. If a retraction pocket is observed at the second stage, transformation of ICWT to an obliteration technique must be performed. Obliteration technique was performed in 34 cases. A second stage was planned in 26 cases only if the mesotympanum was to be dissected raw. Hearing results were better with an intact stapes (56% of air-bone gap less than or equal to 20 dB).

T1  - Closed versus obliteration technique in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - In 533 surgical procedures for cholesteatoma, a closed technique was used in 60%, an obliteration technique with Palva flap was used in 35%, and an open technique was used in 5%. The closed technique has been done in stages in the authors' institution since 1973. The obliteration technique was only staged if the mesotympanum was dissected. In some cases, the Palva flap was partially lifted from the bone to check posterior cavities. A closed technique in one stage provided intact tympanic membrane in 97% of cases, but retraction pocket occurred in 25%; ABG was within 20 dB in 68% of ears if the stapes was intact and in 40% if crura were missing. Obliteration technique in one stage (if the mesotympanum was normal) provided intact tympanic membrane in 100% of cases, but one late residual cholesteatoma under the flap eroded the semicircular canal after 5 years. ABG within 20 dB was achieved in 68% of the ears if the stapes was intact and in 40% if crura were missing. Closed technique in two stages with Silastic sheeting achieved intact tympanic membrane in 97% of the ears. Residual cholesteatoma was removed at the second stage in 24% of the ears. ABG within 20 dB was achieved in 57% of the ears if stapes was intact and in 52% if crura were missing. Ten percent of the ears underwent an obliteration transformation at the second stage because of large mesotympanum cholesteatoma or retraction pocket. Late retraction pockets were observed in 10% of cases. Obliteration technique in two stages provided an intact tympanic membrane in 96.8% of the ears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Importance of en bloc homograft in intact canal wall tympanoplasty
AB  - The incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence using intact canal tympanoplasty has been compared in 2 series of operations. The first group represents cases treated with the conventional conservative technique for attic and middle ear surgery. The second group represents cases on which the concept of 'radical attic and middle ear surgery' has been applied and an en bloc homograft has been used for reconstruction. A preliminary survey has shown a much lower incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence in ears belonging to the second group. The advantages of this surgical technique are discussed.

T1  - "Three cartilages" technique in intact canal wall tympanoplasty to prevent recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Residual cholesteatoma is the consequence of leaving squamous epithelium in the mastoid and middle ear cleft. It has been demonstrated that the only effective way to reduce the risk of epidermoid cyst neoformation is meticulous and radical removal of cholesteatoma matrix and staging of the operation, regardless of whether a closed or open mastoid cavity tympanoplasty technique has been performed. Recurrent cholesteatoma usually occurs after intact canal wall tympanoplasty secondary to middle ear, attic, and mastoid retraction of the graft, especially in cases with destruction of the scutum or absence of malleus and incus; this is still considered a major problem with this surgical technique. During the last five years we have been performing a procedure we have developed to avoid this retraction. Concave autogenous cartilage from the upper part of the concha auriculae trimmed in three pieces to protect attic, mastoid, and middle ear for graft retraction has been successfully used in 106 surgical procedures. This study describes the surgical technique and analyzes the anatomic and hearing results.

T1  - Frequency-specific hearing results after surgery for chronic ear diseases
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze frequency-specific hearing results after surgery for chronic ear diseases while considering pathological findings and various surgical factors.METHODS: Patients who underwent surgical management of chronic otitis media were reviewed retrospectively (n=559). Using pure tone audiometry, air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), and air bone gap (ABG) change between pre- and post-operative tests were calculated for the frequencies of 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 (AC and BC), and 6,000 Hz (AC). Frequency-specific results were investigated, considering various surgical factors, such as type of surgery, type of ossiculoplasty and pathological findings.RESULTS: AC results in the intact canal wall mastoidectomy showed improvement at each frequency except 4,000, 6,000 Hz. AC results in the tympanoplasty showed improvement at each frequency except 6,000 Hz. AC and ABG results in the open cavity mastoidectomy showed improvement only at the frequencies of 250, 500, 2,000 Hz. AC and ABG improved at low and mid frequencies but not in high frequencies above 3,000 Hz when ossicular reconstruction was conducted. AC and ABG results also improved at low and mid frequencies in the cholesteatoma, and ABG results improved at all frequencies except 3,000 Hz in the non-cholesteatoma.CONCLUSION: After chronic ear surgery, AC and ABG changes improved, primarily in the low and mid frequencies. Further evaluation and studies for post-operative hearing loss at high frequencies are recommended for rehabilitation of hearing ability after surgery.

T1  - Mastoid surgery in childhood
AB  - The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed. In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%. Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%. Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy. An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease.

T1  - Clinical and surgical aspects of cholesteatomas in children
AB  - A review of 101 charts of pediatric patients who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma in the Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, showed that the peak incidence was in the 10- to 15-year-old age group (mean age, 10.7 years). A high incidence of complications (45.5%) and a significant functional impairment (air-bone gap greater than 40 dB in 49% of patients) were some of the particular features of our patients. Radical or modified radical mastoidectomies were performed in 75 cases (74.3% of cases). The open technique was chosen primarily to eradicate cholesteomatous disease, but the satisfactory functional results also achieved support our preference for this technique.

T1  - Efficacy of surgical treatment of chronic otitis media
AB  - This article presents our results of surgical treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) and discusses its efficacy regarding the control of disease and hearing results. A retrospective chart review of 84 ears was performed. Forty-one ears with noncholesteatomatous COM underwent tympanomastoidectomy, 43 ears with cholesteatoma were managed according to the extension of the disease, closed mastoidectomy was indicated in 19 cases, and open mastoidectomy was performed in 24 ears. In the group without cholesteatoma, a stable ear with closed tympanic membrane was obtained in 85% of cases after the first procedure. The speech response threshold before and after surgery was 38 and 26 dB. In patients with cholesteatoma, a dry ear was achieved in 79% of cases on both techniques after the first intervention. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 10% for the closed technique and 4% for the open technique. The mean preoperative and postoperative SRTs for the closed technique were 30 and 29 dB and for the open technique were 50 and 54 dB. The surgical treatment for COM can be a rewarding procedure if a correct technique is indicated. The surgery should be tailored regarding the clinical stage and intraoperative findings in each case.

T1  - Techniques of the Tympanomastoidectomy with Reconstruction of the Posterior Bone Wall of the External Auditory Canal
AB  - A combined tympanoplasty method, the mobile-bridge tympanoplasty, has been applied at the Clinic for Ear, Nose and Throat Diseases in Novi Sad since 1998. Mobile-bridge tympanoplasty is performed at our Clinic by applying Feldmann's procedure utilizing a microsurgical oscillating saw. It is a combination of closed and open techniques for surgical treatment of middle ear diseases. In addition to this technique, a method for reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal was introduced. This procedure is applied in cases of damage or impairment of the bony ear canal wall using mastoid cortical temporal bone graft or modeled cartilage of the concha. Maintenance of general anatomical relations in the middle ear enables good ventilation of pneumatic spaces of the middle ear and Eustachian tube permeability, thus providing good conditions for ossicular chain reconstruction. The incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in combined mobile-bridge tympanoplasty and tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the posterior bone wall was 6% in total. The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techniques were 10%. Mobile-bridge tympanoplasty and reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of external auditory canal are methods of choice in surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma that progressed to the attic space, sinus tympani and facial recess.

T1  - Preference for the closed technique in the management of cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children: a retrospective study of 215 consecutive patients treated over 10 years
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical data, extensions, residual and recurrent lesion rates, and functional results in cases of cholesteatoma in pediatric patients.DESIGN: A retrospective study at a single tertiary care center over a decade.PATIENTS: In 199 children (mean age 9.6 years), 215 cholesteatomas were treated surgically, and the children were followed up for an average of 70 months (range 25-118 months).INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic and rehabilitative surgical procedures were done, using either a closed technique (CT) or an open technique: tympanoplasty in open technique (TOT), radical mastoidectomy (RM), or Rambo's technique)MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical findings, residual and recurrent lesions rate, and hearing assessment.RESULTS: The first surgical procedure was CT in 88% of cases, TOT in 10%, RM and Rambo's technique in 1%. Two operations were done in 61.8% of children; 21% had three operations and 4.5% had four. Residual lesions were observed in 21.5% of all children, 32.8% in those undergoing a planned second look. Recurrence rate was 9.8%. Surprisingly, residual and recurrent lesion rates were higher after TOT (23.8% and 19%) than after CT (20.5%, 8.9%), but TOT-treated children had much more extensive lesions. A speech reception threshold (SRT) <30 dB hearing loss (HL) was achieved in 63.7% of patients, and normal hearing was obtained in 12.1%; SRT was significantly better after CT (mean 26.7 dB) than after TOT (mean 37.4 dB), after type II (mean 27 dB) than after type III (35 dB). A high-frequency pure-tone hearing loss >10 dB was uncommon (7.6%).CONCLUSION: These results support the continued use of CT in most cases of cholesteatoma in children in developed countries.

T1  - Congenital middle ear cholesteatomas in children: our experience in 34 cases
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical data, extensions, residual disease rate, and functional results in cases of congenital cholesteatoma in pediatric patients compared with cases of acquired forms.STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: In a retrospective study conducted at a single tertiary care center over a decade, 34 congenital cholesteatomas (mean patient age, 6.6 years) isolated from a series of 215 cholesteatomas in children were treated surgically and followed up for an average of 83 months. Surgical treatment consisted of the closed technique (CT), open technique tympanoplasty in CT [TOT], radical mastoidectomy (RM), or Rambo's technique. The main outcome measures were surgical findings, residual lesion rate, and hearing assessment.RESULTS: The first surgical procedure was CT in 85.3%, TOT in 8.8%, RM in 2.9%, and Rambo's technique in 2.9% of patients. Two, 3, and 4 operations were necessary in 76.5%, 11.4%, and 11.4% of children, respectively. Residual lesions were observed in 34.6% of those multi-operated patients (7 CT and 2 TOT), 24.1% in those treated with CT, and 29.2% in those treated with CT with a planned second look. Mean postoperative pure tone average and air-bone gap were 26 and 21 dB, respectively. A speech reception threshold of less than 30 dB HL was achieved in 66% of patients. A total of 26 ossiculoplasties had to be performed (8 partial and 18 total); the mean postoperative air-bone gap was lower after the former (15 dB) than after the latter (22 dB). A high-frequency pure-tone hearing loss of more than 10 dB was uncommon (5.8%). Unsurprisingly, the residual lesion rate seems to be higher for congenital than for acquired cholesteatomas, but hearing results are significantly better.CONCLUSION: In most cases, staged CT appears to be the best technique to treat these lesions, which often develop in a well-pneumatized mastoid.

T1  - Time trend analysis of mastoidectomy procedures performed in Ontario, 1987-2007
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There has been a reduction in the number of modified radical mastoidectomy and revision mastoidectomy surgeries per head of population in Ontario between 1987 and 2007, we believe that this represents a true reduction in prevalence of cholesteatoma. The increase of cases performed at the University Hospital Network, Toronto (UHN) may represent a shift to subspecialization in the treatment of chronic ear disease.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the trends in mastoid operations for chronic middle ear disease in the Canadian province of Ontario between 1987 and 2007 and to determine whether an increasing proportion of these procedures are being performed in tertiary referral centres.METHODS: The year on year population and number of mastoid procedures performed per year in Ontario and at the UHN between 1987 and 2007 were obtained from Statistics Canada and the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Ontario, respectively. Population-adjusted rates of mastoid surgery for Ontario and the UHN. These data were collated and graphically represented for trend analysis.RESULTS: The population-adjusted number of mastoid procedures for Ontario declined from 7.1 cases per 100,000 in 1986 to 4.1 cases per 100,000 in 2006. During this time the number of both modified radical mastoidectomies and revision mastoid surgeries at UHN increased.

T1  - Longterm results in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - From the results of 689 cases of cholesteatoma operated and followed over a period of 9 years, are discussed the respective indications of opened and closed techniques. The intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy is the preferred technique. It is undertaken on the understanding that it will be done in 2 stages over a 1-year interval. From the revised 460 cases, the presence of residual cholesteatoma was found in one out of 2 cases. Cause of high incidence are analyzed and commented. Retraction pockets or true recurrence of cholesteatoma whose incidence was 11% at the beginning of the series have practically disappeared since it was started to repair the tympanic frame with cartilage. Open techniques, modified radical mastoidectomy, with or without obliteration, are done when a 2-stage procedure is not possible. They are also indicated in particular cases related to the nature of the disease, mastoid pneumatization, condition of the attic wall or the patient's age. Auditory results do not show any significant difference between the open and closed techniques when the ossicular chain is complete or the stapes intact. However, in cases of subtotal ossicular defects, preservation of the tympanic frame provided the most favourable conditions for a functional restoration.

T1  - Hearing results following atticotomy
AB  - Transmeatal atticotomy, a common otosurgical procedure near the turn of the century, has since enjoyed only sporadic periods of popularity. An earlier report illustrated the efficacy of the atticotomy operation in ablating cholesteatoma in 83% of cases. However, the ossicular chain usually suffers discontinuity either through erosion by cholesteatoma or surgical disarticulation. In ears with an intact chain, the incudostapedial joint is usually separated to avoid injury that may be transmitted to the inner ear if the rotating burr contacts the ossicles. The purpose of this paper is to portray the types of hearing restoration attempted and the results achieved in 55 patients who had an atticotomy procedure and had been followed for six months to eight years. The number of patients who attained serviceable hearing are compared to those that did not, with regard to such factors as the hearing level and state of the ossicles preoperatively as well as the extent of the surgery required for removal of the disease. The hearing results in these patients who underwent atticotomy compare favorably to those cited in the literature for tympanoplasties done with the modified radical mastoidectomy or the intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy.

T1  - Hearing results with the Dornhoffer ossicular replacement prostheses
AB  - The "ideal" prosthesis for ossicular reconstruction should, from a surgical standpoint, require easy manipulation, reduce surgeries to partial or total variants, and be constructed of stable, biocompatible material. From an acoustic standpoint, a prosthesis should weigh 10 to 40 mg, provide proper tension between the tympanic membrane (TM) and stapes, form less than a 30-degree angle with the TM, and accommodate the malleus. Work was conducted with Smith & Nephew Richards, Inc. (Memphis, TN), to develop a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) and a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) that combined the majority of these features. This retrospective study used a computerized otologic database to identify patients implanted with a Dornhoffer HAPEX PORP or TORP from June 1995 to March 1997. The surgical procedures utilizing these prostheses were primary cholesteatoma and revision surgery of previously performed modified or radical mastoidectomies complicated by poor hearing or chronically draining cavities. Preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction four-frequency (500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 Hz) pure-tone averages (PTAs) were used to calculate the PTA air-bone gaps (ABGs). Results in 52 cases (follow-up, 1 year) showed a statistically significant improvement in hearing (P < 0.05) for each group. Excellent hearing results (< or = 10 dB PTA-ABG) were seen in 69% of PORP cases and in 35% of TORP cases, and good results (11 to 20 dB PTA-ABG) were seen in 31% and 50% of PORP and TORP cases, respectively. Designing an ossicular replacement prosthesis with both surgical and acoustic factors in mind has led to encouraging short-term hearing results.

T1  - Congenital aural cholesteatoma: results of surgery in 60 cases
AB  - From 1978 to 1993, 59 patients (60 ears) with congenital middle ear cholesteatoma were treated at the House Ear Clinic. The median patient age at presentation was 5 years, and the period of postoperative follow-up was 4.8 years. An intact canal wall was maintained in 58 of 60 cases and a closed middle ear space in all cases. In 12 operations, lateral graft tympanoplasty eradicated the cholesteatoma in one stage; 32 patients required a second-stage surgery to rule out recurrence, and the remaining 16 cases required three or more operations to eradicate disease and reconstruct the hearing mechanism. Thirty-five (63%) of 56 patients had a postoperative air-conduction threshold pure-tone average (PTA) within 10 dB of the best bone-conduction PTA; 91% were within 20 dB. Average speech reception threshold improved from 32 dB hearing level (HL) preoperatively to 20 dB HL postoperatively.

T1  - Evaluation of using Bioglass R in obliteration of mastoid cavity
AB  - BACKGROUND: A mastoid cavity resulting from a canal wall down mastoidectomy can result in major morbidity for patients due to different open cavity problems. Mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of the bony external ear canal recreates the normal anatomy to avoid such morbidity.METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted for 4 years (between 2008 - 2013) to determine if mastoid obliteration with bioactive glass (Bioglass R) following mastoidectomy overcomes the open cavity problems or not. Patients with cholesteatoma had subjected tomastoidectomy with primary or secondary mastoid obliteration, by using bioactive glass (Bioglass R),then our primary outcome measure.RESULTS: Forty patients were interviewed. Forty of them were primary or secondary obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomy of a primary cholesteatoma. The most frequent fate of obliteration or reconstruction of mastoid was Grade 1 (47.5%) then Grade 0 (30%). Postoperative hearing assessment showed that the average (mean) air conduction (0.5-4 KHz) was 31.1 dB and the average (mean) bone conduction (0.5-4 KHz) was 15.5 dB. The gain average in air conduction was 26 dB and in bone conduction it was 0.5 dB. Ear discharge was found in 36 patients (90%) preoperative and it was found only in 6 patients (15%) postoperative, in 4 patients (10%) cholesteatoma recidivism or recurrences was present.CONCLUSION: This study shows that the bioactive glass (Bioglass R) is one of the beat materials used in mastoidectomy with obliteration of open mastoid cavity.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in 3-D
AB  - 1. In Shambaugh's primary acquired cholesteatoma, the surgical approach of choice is the direct endaural transcanal modified radical mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty in continuity. 2. In Shambaugh's classification of the secondary acquired cholesteatoma developing in a previously pneumatic mastoid with the infection of short duration, the postauricular transcortical mastoidectomy and facial recess approach and tympanoplasty in continuity is worthy of consideration if there is a reasonable possibility that the eustachian tube function may return to normal. 3. In Shambaugh's classification of a secondary acquired cholesteatoma in a large mastoid with the infection of long duration, there is probably cicatricial stenosis of the eustachian tube with a postauricular transcortical mastoidectomy and facial recess approach. It is probably a futile procedure because of the high incidence of recurrent attic retraction cholesteatoma requiring a secondary modified radical mastoidectomy. 4. Recurrent attic retraction cholesteatoma is subject to external reinfection and may cause a subperiosteal abscess or other complications many years after the primary surgery. 5. Residual cholesteatoma is the "bug bear" of any closed technique. This self-contained cyst is slow growing and may not become apparent for many years. Since it is not subject to reinfection, it is an insidious, destructive, silent lesion which may ultimately present itself as a postauricular pitting mass, erosion of the canal wall, facial paralysis, or a fistula in the labyrinth. 6. In invasive cholesteatoma and in long-standing secondary acquired cholesteatoma, the attempted preservation of the canal wall is a futile process and the surgeon is able to perform more accurate surgery with the direct primary transcanal approach to the mastoid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) [References: 11]

T1  - Mechanisms of cholesteatoma formation following stapedectomy
AB  - Poststapedectomy cholesteatoma is uncommon. We report a patient with bilateral cholesteatomas, each following an initially successful stapedectomy for conductive hearing loss due to stapedial fixation from otosclerosis. A revision right stapedectomy done in 1972 was complicated 4 years later by prosthesis extrusion and cholesteatoma. An extensive left cholesteatoma occurred 7 years after stapedectomy in 1977 and required a radical mastoidectomy. The etiology of poststapedectomy cholesteatoma in this patient was probably chronic eustachian tube dysfunction and negative middle ear pressures. The initial right cholesteatoma occurred following prosthesis extrusion, which is presumed to have been the portal of entry of squamous epithelium into the middle ear. The later-occurring left poststapedectomy cholesteatoma represented progression of an attic retraction pocket. Both of these complications were likely secondary to negative middle ear pressure. In addition to eustachian tube dysfunction, other proposed etiologies for poststapedectomy cholesteatoma formation include prosthesis extrusion independent of negative middle ear pressure, unrecognized presence of squamous epithelium in an oval window fat graft, an inverted tympanomeatal flap due to improper positioning, and a marginal perforation from a disrupted anulus. Poststapedectomy cholesteatoma is a rare phenomenon, but does occur. The preoperative exclusion of patients with eustachian tube dysfunction and proper surgical techniques should reduce this complication.

T1  - Bone Pate Obliteration in Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy: Modifications of an Established Technique
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe outcomes with obliteration of the mastoid and medial attic following canal wall down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma. Our technique uses bone pate in the mastoid and cartilage in the epitympanum and supratubal recess.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.SETTING: Tertiary medical center.PATIENTS: Ten years of sequential canal wall down mastoidectomies with obliteration from one neurotologist were reviewed. This included primary and revision cases in adults and children.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications, location and extent of cholesteatoma, the presence of a dry ear after surgery, cholesteatoma recidivism, revision procedures, and postoperative hearing.RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients (79 ears) met inclusion criteria. There were few major complications. There was active follow-up of a year or more in 61. For these, the mean follow-up was 3.1 years, and approximately 90% had a dry cavity for the remainder of their follow-up. About half required minimal (if any) maintenance. There were five cases with residual disease, and no cases with recurrent disease. There were five cases that were considered failures, with three taking several years to manifest. There were no cases where cholesteatoma was buried in bone pate. A sizeable minority continued to have active tubotympanic disease despite successful treatment of the attic and mastoid.CONCLUSIONS: This seems to be a safe and reliable means to eradicate cholesteatoma and create a dry, low-maintenance cavity. It is not a cure for tubotympanic disease, and a small minority of initially stable cavities may fail several years following surgery.Level of evidence: 4.

T1  - Regenerated middle ear mucosa after tympanoplasty
AB  - The surgeon's attitude towards the diseased middle ear mucosa during intact canal wall tympanoplasty has remained a controversial problem. Our approach consists of the complete removal of the irreversibly diseased mucosal lining. A planned staged operation has been carried out in most cases of tympanoplasty with the use of Silastic sheeting. At the time of the second operation, the middle ear and mastoid process appear to be lined by the regenerated mucosa and pneumatized. 54 mucosal biopsies taken during the second stage of the operation showed a normal flat, cuboidal and pseudostratified ciliated epithelium with functional features (secretory granules, microvilli and cilia). It is concluded that the diseased middle ear mucosa can be removed whenever necessary during staged closed-tympanoplasty operations because under the Silastic sheeting the mucosa will be regenerated within 12 months.

T1  - Long-term results of various surgical treatments for cholesteatoma
AB  - The authors have studied 11 series of results following cholesteatoma surgery by closed or open technique. The closed technique was performed in 77%. The notion of surgical revision is not accepted by all surgeons; it is practised with an average of 59% for the whole series. Residual cholesteatoma and/or recurrences are observed in 34% of the cases of which 20% have been discovered at the time of revision surgery. Surgical revision appears mandatory to the authors.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula after cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To report on cases of labyrinthine fistula diagnosed in an ear, nose, and throat department and to study the incidence, location, pre- and postoperative symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, facial palsy), preoperative diagnostic imaging, and surgical treatment of two types of cholesteatomatous labyrinthine fistulae-the extensive fistula that erodes both the bony and membranous labyrinths and the bone fistula that affects only the bony labyrinth.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.PATIENTS: Fifty-four patients with cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media with labyrinthine fistulae.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.INTERVENTIONS: Diagnosis and treatment.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical, imaging, and surgical correlation of extensive fistulae and bone fistulae.RESULTS: The incidence of labyrinthine fistulae was 7% in all patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media. The bone type (66%) is more common than the extensive type (33%). Compared with bone fistulae, the outcome for extensive fistulae is more severe in terms of hearing loss, vertigo, and facial palsy. In terms of preoperative diagnosis, computed tomography imaging ensured early diagnosis in 89% of extensive cases and in 28% of bone cases. For extensive fistulae, the surgical technique was more radical, requiring an open technique in 66% of cases versus 22% of the bone fistulae cases. The most common location is the lateral semicircular canal (61%).CONCLUSIONS: The breach in the membranous labyrinth is consistent with a more aggressive pathology, causing more severe pre- and postoperative symptoms. Preoperative computed tomography is more sensitive for diagnosing extensive fistulae, which also require a more radical treatment.

T1  - Butterfly cartilage graft inlay tympanoplasty for large perforations
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Butterfly graft inlay tympanoplasty is a well-established technique for the repair of small perforations. However, the efficacy of the technique for medium and large tympanic membrane perforations remains unknown.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.METHODS: Postauricular tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy using a large butterfly cartilage inlay graft (>4 mm diameter to total drum replacement) were analyzed in 90 pediatric patients (99 ears).RESULTS: Patient ages ranged from 2 to 20 years; mean follow-up duration was 27.6 months. Successful closure occurred in 92% of the ears. No graft lateralized nor displaced into the middle ear. No retraction pocket occurred during the follow-up period. In 62 cases, intact canal wall or canal wall window tympanomastoidectomy was performed; Fifty-one (82.2%) of the patients having mastoidectomy procedures had chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The mean preoperative to postoperative four-tone air-bone gap improved from 23 to 21 dB; the number of patients with 0 to 10 dB hearing results increased from 16 ears preoperatively to 32 ears postoperatively. Postoperative suboptimal results included eight patients with postoperative perforations in the residual tympanic membrane adjacent to an intact cartilage graft; two of these patients were the only individuals who exhibited otorrhea.CONCLUSIONS: Cartilage butterfly graft inlay tympanoplasty is effective in the vast majority of patients with moderate to large perforations. The closure rate exceeded 90% with no graft displacement, postoperative adverse events were respectably low, and hearing results improved or remained stable despite the need for concurrent mastoidectomy in the majority of patients.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - The surgical management of cholesteatoma in children remains a controversial subject. Many authors hold that the disease itself is more aggressive than that seen in adults. Furthermore, there appears to be a consensus that intact canal wall procedures, if used at all, should be reserved for adults only. The purpose of this paper is to study a group of children and adults who underwent the surgical removal of their cholesteatoma by intact canal wall tympanoplasty at the Otology Group between March 1, 1971 and March 1, 1977. A comparison of the results and complications in the two groups is presented in detail.

T1  - Intact canal wall tympanoplasty in the management of cholesteatoma
AB  - There are presently two schools of thought on the proper surgical management of cholesteatoma associated with chronic ear disease: one feels that the ear should be exteriorized and left "open"; the other takes the position that the disease can be removed, and the ear left in its normal anatomical and functional state. The latter group are known to favor a "closed" or more conservative procedure. The purpose of this paper is to review a series of patients who have had cholesteatoma managed by an intact canal wall procedure that prevents a postoperative cavity. Out of a series of 590 chronic ear surgeries performed between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 1974, there were 179 done for cholesteatoma (30 percent). There were 153 patients, 26 of whom had bilateral disease. Twenty-three patients were lost to follow-up, giving an overall total of 154 surgeries with from one to five-year information. The overall follow-up rate was 85 percent. Recurrent cholesteatoma was the most bothersome complication and occurred in 14 percent of the series. Residual cholesteatoma was managed by doing all procedures in two stages. The authors feel that the intact canal wall tympanoplasty is a procedure that will gain acceptance and will be more widely used in the future.

T1  - Acute mastoiditis in children: presentation and long term consequences
AB  - UNLABELLED: Acute mastoiditis, a destructive bacterial infection of the mastoid bone and air cell system, is relatively uncommon today but remains a potentially serious condition. There is a lack of information in the literature regarding the long term otological problems that children may face following an episode of this condition.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the presentation, complications and hospital course in this patient population, and to ascertain whether these patients had long term otological problems.METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients presenting with acute mastoiditis between January 1990 and December 2005. Patients' parents were contacted by telephone and questioned about further otological problems.RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were included in the study, and 27 of these patients' parents were contactable to complete the telephone questionnaire. Sixty-nine per cent of children had no previous history of acute otitis media prior to presentation. Forty-five per cent of patients had received oral antibiotics prior to presentation. Sixty-two per cent of patients developed complications, i.e. a subperiosteal abscess or failure to respond to medical therapy, resulting in the need for surgical intervention (in the form of incision and drainage of periosteal abscess, cortical mastoidectomy, or grommet insertion). Mean follow up of patients was eight years and one month; five (17 per cent) patients had been followed up for less than one year. Two (7 per cent) patients developed a further episode of mastoiditis within six weeks of initial presentation, both of whom required cortical mastoidectomy. Three (10 per cent) patients had further problems with recurrent acute otitis media, requiring tympanostomy tube insertion. One patient required a modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma (15 years later). Twenty-two patients (91 per cent) had been followed up for longer than one year; these patients had subjectively normal hearing and were asymptomatic at the time of study.CONCLUSION: The majority of patients who had suffered an episode of acute mastoiditis had no adverse long term otological sequelae.

T1  - Joseph Toynbee Memorial Lecture, 1976. Tympanoplasty--four heterodox techniques
AB  - Polarization between proponents of intact canal wall tympanoplasty and radical (modified) mastoidectomy in the treatment of cholesteatoma and other irreversible temporal bone lesions can be avoided in many cases by the use of one or more special techniques. These include (a) Gelfilm (no-graft) induction of tympanic membrane regrowth; (b) the use of tragal cartilage and perichondrium in columellization and in Type III neomyringostapediopexy; (c) the use of laboratory-prefabricated ossicular homografts to correct malleal-capitulum and malleal-footplate discontinuities more precisely; and (d) the circumferential approach (circumnavigation of patient's head) and anterior position of the surgeon in order to visualize the sinus tympani, retropyramidal, and retrofacial areas, obviating extensive posterior tympanotomy bone dissections. These techniques make possible a third alternative to the choice of either combined-approach tympanoplasty or radical or modified radical mastoidectomy in the treatment of a number of advanced temporal bone lesions.

T1  - High incidence of complications encountered in chronic otitis media surgery in a U.S. metropolitan public hospital
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the incidence and nature of complicating factors in surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) in a metropolitan public hospital in the United States.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed over 2 years in a metropolitan public hospital to identify cases of surgery for chronic ear disease with the following complicating factors: intracranial or extracranial abscess, labyrinthine fistula, dural dehiscence with or without associated encephalocele or meningocele, or extensive involvement of the facial nerve by cholesteatoma with or without paralysis.RESULTS: Thirty-three of 90 consecutive operations for COM (37%) met criteria for complicated chronic otitis media (CCOM). The majority (85%) of patients had cholesteatoma involvement. Most patients (73%) were managed by an extended modified radical mastoidectomy. An additional 31 procedures were required in these 33 patients for control of complications. There was no iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss or facial paralysis.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CCOM in this large, U.S. metropolitan public hospital is similar to that observed in developing nations. CCOM significantly complicates chronic ear surgery and substantially increases the use of resources. Maintaining functional hearing is possible, but difficult, and should be considered secondary to prevention of further complications and eradication of disease. Access to health care and proper follow-up are crucial in prevention of CCOM.

T1  - Residue of middle ear cholesteatoma after intact canal wall tympanoplasty: surgical findings at one year
AB  - The rate of residual disease after surgery for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma was investigated in 167 ears of 164 patients who had undergone planned second-look tympanoplasty by the intact canal wall technique. Overall, operative findings at the second stage revealed 65 cases of residual disease in 48 ears (29%). These consisted of 50 squamous pearls, 11 cases of the flat, open type, and 4 cases of the extensive type. The configuration of residual disease is closely related to the technical difficulty of eradication, since en bloc removal is much easier in the squamous pearl than in the open or extensive type, mainly because of the unclear margin with the surrounding tissues. The proportion of cases of the open type was greater in children than in adults, in pars tensa cholesteatoma than in pars flaccida cholesteatoma, and in severe primary middle ear disease than in moderate or mild disease, although these differences were not statistically significant. The extensive type occurred in 4 ears with severe primary disease, 3 of which were in children. These results support the value and importance of the staged procedure for middle ear cholesteatoma, particularly when operated on by the intact canal wall technique.

T1  - Defects in the bony wall of the mastoid bowl: a study based on staged intact canal-wall tympanoplasty
AB  - The incidence and outcome of bony wall defects in the mastoid bowl were studied in 175 ears of 167 patients who underwent staged tympanoplasty by the intact canal-wall technique. In the first stage, the middle fossa dura was exposed iatrogenically in 38 ears and pathologically in eight ears through a defect at the tegmen. In the second stage, the bone defect was cured in 27 ears of the former group and in 3 ears of the latter group. The overall cure rate of the defect in the tegmen during these stages was 65.2 percent (30/46). Exposure of the sigmoid sinus or posterior fossa dura, which had occurred iatrogenically in 12 ears in the first stage, was cured in 11 ears (91.7%) in the second stage. Defects of the anterior wall of the mastoid bowl, i.e., the posterior wall of the external auditory canal, were recognized in 105 ears in the first stage, 91 of which involved pathologic defects of the tympanic scutum caused by cholesteatoma. In the second stage, these defects remained unhealed with cures occurring in only two ears (1.9%), in which a small hole had been created iatrogenically in the middle of the canal wall. Defects in the canal wall due to bone resorption following the first stage operation were noted in the second stage in 26 of 175 ears (14.9%).

T1  - BPIFA1 Gene Expression in the Human Middle Ear Mucosa
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The bactericidal/permeability-increasing, fold-containing family member A1 (BPIFA1) gene codes a secretory protein (BPIFA1), which is present in the respiratory tract mucosa, and is part of the innate immune system. This study aimed to prove that BPIFA1 gene expression exists in the human middle ear mucosa.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 32 patients participated in the study between March 2016 and September 2016. Seventeen patients had chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (COMC) and 15 had bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (BSHL). The patients with COMC underwent radical mastoidectomy with cholesteatoma removal and those with BSHL underwent cochlear implantation. Part of the processus mastoideus mucosa was examined for BPIFA1 gene expression and the two groups were compared.RESULTS: For the first time, BPIFA1 gene expression was examined in the mucosa of the human middle ear, and it was verified in 100% (n=32) of the participants. We confirmed that there is a difference in the BPIFA1 expression in 83.33% of the patients with COMC compared to the patients with BSHL but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.947; probably due to the low number of participants in this group).CONCLUSION: It is highly likely that the BPIFA1 protein participates in the non-specific immune defense of the middle ear and is relevant to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory diseases of the middle ear.

T1  - Otogenic intracranial complications. a 7-year retrospective review
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to review our experience on intracranial complications secondary to otitis media (OM), and to compare the results to those occurring 10-15 years ago. We also reviewed the timing of both otologic and neurosurgical treatments.MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients with intracranial complications secondary to OM over a 7-year period were identified. A retrospective chart review was undertaken at Beaumont University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Clinical presentation, radiological findings, microbiology, surgical management, and antibiotic use were studied. We compare our findings to those of other international investigators.RESULTS: Twelve cases were identified. Five had brain abscesses, 4 had lateral sinus thrombosis, and 3 had petrous apicitis. Eight of these cases were secondary to chronic OM and 4 were secondary to acute OM. Malodorous otorrhea, otalgia, headache, fever, and vertigo were the primary symptoms. Anaerobic bacteria were the most commonly isolated organisms followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with cholesteatoma underwent modified radical or radical mastoidectomy, and those who did not have cholesteatoma underwent cortical mastoidectomy. Two brain abscesses were drained before mastoid surgery; 2 were drained after mastoid surgery and 1 at the same time as otologic surgery. All patients received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics targeted at individual culture and sensitivity results. The mortality rate was zero.CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation and the frequency of occurrence of intracranial complications are similar to those occurring 10 years ago. The choice of antibiotics should include adequate anaerobic cover. We recommend that otologic surgery be performed at the same time as intracranial surgery for patients with mature brain abscesses.

T1  - Systematic preservation of the ossicular chain in cholesteatoma surgery using a fiber-guided laser
AB  - OBJECTIVES: 1. To investigate whether systematic preservation of the intact ossicular chain in cholesteatoma surgery provides better hearing than dismantling the chain and reconstructing it. 2. To determine whether systematic preservation of the ossicular chain in cholesteatoma surgery can be performed safely.STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal parallel group study.SETTING: District general hospital and private hospital.PATIENTS: Adults and children who underwent primary intact canal wall cholesteatoma surgery.INTERVENTIONS: Group A: Laser-assisted cholesteatoma surgery resulting in an intact ossicular chain. Group B: Laser-assisted cholesteatoma surgery resulting in a disrupted chain and an ossiculoplasty onto an intact stapes superstructure.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 1a. Conductive hearing loss (four frequency air-bone gap). 1b. Patient-orientated outcome (Belfast Rules of Thumb). 2a. Change in bone conduction threshold (four frequencies). 2b. Residual cholesteatoma rate. 2c. Rate of facial palsy.RESULTS: There were eighty ears in Group A and sixty-nine in group B. The median hearing loss for Group A is 11.44 dB HL. The median hearing loss for Group B is 15.63 dB HL. (p = 0.001). Seventy out of eighty ears in Group A and forty-six out of sixty-nine ears in Group B fulfilled the Belfast Rule of Thumb. (p = 0.002). The null hypothesis is rejected for both of the hearing outcome measures. The two groups did not significantly differ in respect of any of the risk assessment measures.CONCLUSION: The fibre-guided laser allows the cholesteatoma surgeon to preserve the ossicular chain in a systematic manner which is both safe and of benefit to the patient.

T1  - Mastoidectomy audit: results of the Royal College of surgeons of England comparative audit of ENT surgery
AB  - This paper presents the results of a national comparative audit of mastoid surgery, retrospectively analysing 611 operations by 55 consultants. Confidentiality for both patient and surgeon was assured. For cholesteatoma 80% of mastoidectomies performed were open cavity procedures and for other middle ear disease 58% used an intact canal wall technique. Thirty-two surgeons used only an open cavity mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma during the period of the audit. There was a statistically significantly greater number of wet ears with open cavities than with closed cavities, but the frequency of the operator did not correlate with the dry ear rate. Ten serious complications (facial palsy and dead ear) were recorded. All occurred in open cavity mastoidectomies. The post-operative hearing status was unknown in 40% of patients.

The patient was treated successfully with marsupialization through a radical mastoidectomy and sphenoid sinusotomy. Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated continued cholesteatoma growth. Bone-conduction thresholds remained normal despite replacement of the internal auditory canal by cholesteatoma matrix. The patient continues to have chronic otorrhea, but is otherwise asymptomatic.

T1  - Extracranial complications of chronic suppurative otitis media
AB  - The aim of this study was to find out the pattern of extracranial complications of CSOM cases who attended to the department of ENTD, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital during the period from July'1999 to June' 2001. Different types of extracranial complications of CSOM were presented here. A total of 100 cases, diagnosed clinically and radiologically were included in the study of which 66 were male and 34 were female giving a male to female ratio of 1.94 : 1 (p < 0.05). Majority cases (53) were in the age group of 11- 20 years followed by the age group of below 10 years where there were 30 cases. Majority (64) cases came from low socio-economic class. The number of different types of extracranial complications of CSOM were as follows: mastoid abscess 57, discharging sinuses 28, purulent labyrinthitis 07, Bezold's abscess 04, fascial nerve paralysis 03 and zygomatic abscess 01. In all cases of CSOM Cholesteatoma were detected. In 14 cases, Cholesteatoma were associated with granulation tissue/polyp. Modified radical mastoidectomy were performed in all cases. On analyzing the findings of the present study it was observed that mastoid abscess were the predominant extracranial complications of CSOM, affecting mostly the male population of 11 - 20 years age group coming from low socio-economic class.

T1  - Cholesteatoma with intact tympanic membrane: a report of 41 cases
AB  - Aural cholesteatoma may present itself as an unexplained hearing impairment without either perforation or otorrhea and without radiologic evidence of bone destruction. The etiology is probably congenital. In our cholesteatoma cases, 3.7% occur in individuals with an intact tympanic membrane. Most of these patients have had the disease 5 years or less and 50% are under 20 years of age. Complications of the disease are uncommon in this group. All but 1 of our 41 cases were managed with the intact canal wall technique. Most were reexplored (planned second-stage) and residual disease was encountered in 32%. One should keep the possibility of a congentital cholesteatoma in mind wheneger encountering a unilateral serous otitis media or an unexplained unilateral conductive hearing impairment, regardless of the patient's age.

T1  - Subperiosteal mastoid abscesses in chronic suppurative otitis media
AB  - In Europe and America, acute mastoiditis usually appears as a complication of acute otitis media, and some patients develop subperiosteal mastoid abscesses. In Nigeria, however, most subperiosteal mastoid abscesses develop from chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Of the 16 patients with subperiosteal mastoid abscesses discussed, 11 (69%) had cholesteatoma and only five (31%) had granulation tissue in the mastoid cavity. The ideal treatment for these cases is modified radical mastoidectomy. Radiographic investigation of the mastoid can be useful in the diagnosis of cholesteatoma in the presence of a subperiosteal mastoid abscess.

T1  - Treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - We studied retrospectively 28 cases of cholesteatoma in children whose ages were 3 to 13 years old. All had undergone surgery between 1989 and 1995. The intact canal wall technique was the predominant method used in the initial operation, with long term goals of an anatomically normal and infection-free ear. Cholesteatoma was found postoperatively in 15 cases and was considered to be residual in 6 cases and recurrent in 9. The residual cholesteatoma was relatively uncommon and usually removable in an exploratory second operation. Our findings showed that the intact canal wall technique was the best initial operation if two-stage surgery was planned. Avoidance of a retraction pocket, which tends to progress to a recurrent cholesteatoma, is important to successful treatment.

T1  - Residual Cholesteatoma After Endoscope-guided Surgery in Children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopes can facilitate surgery within tympanomastoid recesses that are not visible with the operating microscope. This study investigates whether use of endoscopes to guide dissection of cholesteatoma leads to lower rates of residual cholesteatoma than using the endoscope only for inspection after microscope-guided dissection.STUDY DESIGN: Comparative cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary pediatric center.PATIENTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients with acquired or congenital cholesteatoma in children <18 years having intact canal wall surgery and follow-up >12 months.INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of group (A) microscope surgery followed by endoscopic inspection, with group (B) endoscope-guided dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Residual cholesteatoma rates, controlling for site of initial cholesteatoma, detection by second-stage surgery, and length of follow-up.RESULTS: Analysis of all patients showed endoscopic dissection was associated with less residua in the middle ear (risk difference = 0.12; p = 0.026, Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis; number needed to treat = 9) but not at other sites. When restricting analysis to ears that were evaluated with second look surgery, no significant reduction in residual disease was found after endoscopic dissection at any site (e.g., retrotympanic residua: 12% Group A versus 7% Group B (NS, Fisher exact test). Endoscopic dissection allowed more permeatal surgery. No complications were attributable to endoscope use. Wound complications occurred in 4% of open cases.CONCLUSION: Endoscopes enhance surgical access to tympanomastoid recesses. In conjunction with the availability of the operating microscope, angled instruments, and KTP laser, endoscope-guided dissection provides a small incremental benefit for prevention of residual cholesteatoma, and facilitates a minimally invasive approach.

T1  - Fallopian canal dehiscence: can it be pridicted
AB  - The aim of the study is to give an idea about true incidence and most common location of fallopian canal dehiscence and to identify predictive factors associated with fallopian canal dehiscence based on preoperative and peroperative clinical correlates so as to facilitate preemptive prediction of the condition. The study design pertains to a prospective study. The setting of the study was tertiary referral hospital and a total of 146 patients underwent radical and modified radical mastoidectomy as primary procedure between Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2004. The site of dehiscence and associated pre-operative and per-operative findings were noted. Our results showed the incidence of fallopian canal dehiscence among cases undergoing radical and modified radical mastoidectomy was 82/1000 per year. Around 66.6% dehiscence was located in tympanic segment. The preoperative factors significantly associated with the fallopian canal dehiscence (p< 0.05) were Aural polyp, Extra-cranial complications, Cholesteatoma and Facial palsy. Per-operative findings were Cholesteatoma, All ossicles necrosed except stapes footplate and Lateral semicircular canal fistula.

T1  - Multilateral scrutiny of the Gulhane mastoidectomy
AB  - This study has been conducted in order to analyze the outcomes of a previously described technique for chronic otitis media surgery: the improved radical mastoidectomy with flap (formerly IRMF), which consisted of improved radical mastoidectomy (formerly IRM), inferiorly based fascioperiosteal flap and large meatoconchoplasty (Kahramanyol, Ear Nose Throat J 71:70-77, 1992; Kahramanyol et al., Ear Nose Throat J 79:524-526, 2000). The technique is hereafter referred as the Gulhane mastoidectomy. During a period of 22 consecutive years, 255 patients have been operated on and treated utilizing the technique mentioned above. Despite extensive otologic destruction and concomitant severe complications, the technique rendered impressive outcomes: the cavities became smaller over time and remained healthy, providing good life quality for the patients. Cholesteatoma recurrence was observed in but one patient. The outcomes confirm the value and usefulness of the technique.

T1  - Fascioperiosteal flap and neo-osteogenesis in radical mastoidectomy: long-term results
AB  - We performed an analysis of long-term outcomes data on 60 patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma who had undergone a surgical procedure based on an improved radical mastoidectomy and an inferiorly based fascioperiosteal flap. We found that at the 2-, 7-, 10-, and 13-year postoperative followup visits, all mastoid cavities were healthy and reduced in volume. At the final examination, the mean cavity volume was found to be decreased by 39% of the mean volume measured 1 month postoperatively. This reduction in volume is attributable to the neo-osteogenic activity of the flap, which was confirmed by histopathologic and radiologic findings. No recurrences took place.

T1  - Cochlear implant infection due to cholesteatoma
AB  - There are an increasing number of young children undergoing cochlear implantation. Cholesteatoma is a serious, although rare, long-term complication. We present the only documented case in which cholesteatoma has presented with late abscess formation in the bed of a cochlear implant package of a child. Cholesteatoma may be an iatrogenic complication of implantation surgery. Damage to the bony part of the external auditory canal should be avoided. The successful two-staged surgical treatment using explantation, debridement, gentamycin bead insertion, cholesteatoma excision and modified radical mastoidectomy is described. The intra-cochlear electrode was removed precluding cochlear implant reimplantation. This late presentation supports regular long-term otoscopic review of cochlear implant patients by experienced otologists. Suspicion should be raised in patients with persistent otorrhoea.

T1  - Hearing outcomes following primary malleostapedial rotation ossiculoplasty in patients undergoing modified radical mastoidectomy
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of cholesteatoma consists of either excision or exteriorisation of disease. Approaches have traditionally included a radical or modified radical mastoidectomy and combined approach tympanoplasty. Hearing thresholds following a modified radical mastoidectomy alone have been reported as poor. We assessed hearing outcomes in patients undergoing a primary malleostapedial reconstruction combined with their open cavity surgery.METHODS: All patients undergoing open cavity mastoidectomy with primary malleostapedial rotation ossiculoplasty between 2009 and 2013 were identified. Case notes were reviewed, and demographic data, recurrence rate and audiometry were recorded.RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified. The age range was 10-65 years. There was no evidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 20dBHL, 23dBHL, 10dBHL and 27dBHL at 0.5kHz, 1kHz, 2kHz and 4kHz respectively. Excluding cases consistent with a postoperative ossicular discontinuity (n=3), the mean postoperative air-bone gap was 15dBHL, 19dBHL, 8dBHL and 26dBHL at 0.5kHz, 1kHz, 2kHz and 4kHz respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in hearing thresholds demonstrated in this cohort of patients supports the use of this form of ossiculoplasty in those undergoing open cavity procedures. This would also suggest that the subsequent use of hearing aids in these patients would require less amplification and therefore provide superior hearing outcomes. As hearing loss remains a significant concern following modified radical mastoidectomy, we suggest an open cavity with primary malleostapedial rotation ossiculoplasty as a viable alternative to modified radical mastoidectomy alone, in selected cases.

T1  - Postoperative aural attico-antroscopy for cholesteatoma
AB  - The postoperative cavity made by intact canal wall tympanoplasty for aural cholesteatoma was observed by inserting an aural attico-antroscopy (3A-scopy), developed by improving the antroscope for observations of the maxillary sinus, through a small incision made in the retroauricular region under local anesthesia. The 3A-scopy was effective in postoperative observations of the cavity which had undergone intact canal wall tympanoplasty, especially in the diagnosis of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma and in the observation of the postoperative cavity in the cases with long-standing discharge.

T1  - Mastoiditis in children
AB  - Fifty-two children with mastoiditis were treated at the Federal Government Services Hospital over a period of 15 years (from 1986 to 2000). The salient feature in these cases was the presence of a post-auricular swelling and mastoid abscess. Extensive cholesteatoma was seen in 80.7 per cent of cases and 19.3 per cent had granulations in the mastoid cavity. Significantly, all patients had a history of chronic ear discharge prior to abscess formation. These children belonged to poor communities, were malnourished and attended hospital in a state of emergency. The presentation and course of the disease confirms the aggressive and potentially serious nature of the pathology requiring early medical attention in order to avert impending complications. It appears that in our environment acute mastoiditis with abscess formation develops from chronic otitis media and the cholesteatoma. The surgical procedures conducted in these cases were radical and modified radical mastoidectomy.

T1  - Modified radical mastoidectomy and its complications--12 years' experience
AB  - To find the incidence of complications of modified radical mastoidectomy and to evaluate different parameters that play a role in their causation, we conducted a retrospective study spanning a period of 12 years. Included were 210 patients who underwent primary modified radical mastoidectomies performed by one senior surgeon; of these patients, 163 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The charts were evaluated for patients' age and sex, laterality, intraoperative pathology, and complications. The complications were grouped into nine categories for analysis of their etiology. The results in this study were compared with those from other published reports. Complications were documented in 46 of 163 (28.2%) operated ears; 21 (45.7%) of them were noted in children <15 years of age, and 25 (54.3%) were found in adults. Sex and laterality were of no significance. The most common complication recorded was residual/recurrent cholesteatoma (20 [12.3%]), followed by meatal stenosis (11 [6.7%]). A moist cavity with discharging ear was noted in only 4 (2.5%) patients. No facial nerve palsies or dead ears were observed. Eleven (6.7%) patients had more than one complication. The parameters evaluated were size of the meatus, tympanic membrane appearance, status of the mastoid cavity, height of the facial ridge, and extent of the disease process. Complications can be caused by a number of factors, such as congenital anomalies, disease process, and the surgeon's skill. Each complication must be thoroughly evaluated for immediate management and to learn how to avoid it in the future.

T1  - Correlation between MRI findings and second-Look operation in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - Two-staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty is a common operation for treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma. MRI provides better tissue differentiation of the middle ear and/or mastoid, which often become occupied with soft density tissue after the first operation. If MRI was able to detect the presence of a recurrent or residual cholesteatoma with sufficient sensitivity and specificity, this may facilitate a decrease in the number of second-look procedures. This study compared MRI findings to surgical findings at second-look surgery and calculated the correlation rates between the two sets of findings. Thirty ears having undergone intact canal wall tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma at the initial operation were examined by MRI prior to the second look. Otoscopic findings of the tympanic membrane were nonsuspect in all cases. The true positive rate was 11/30 (37%) and the true negative rate was 10/30 (33%), leading to a radiosurgical correlation of 70%, whereas the false positive rate was 6/30 (20%) and the false negative rate was 3/30 (10%). This indicates that 30% of the MRI findings were incorrect. Therefore, at the present time, MRI does not appear as a likely replacement for second-look surgery in cases of intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel

T1  - Intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: long-term follow-up
AB  - One hundred four ears operated for cholesteatoma using the intact wall technique were studied in 1981. In the 1981 study, there was a 7% recurrence rate in adults and a 25% recurrence rate in children after a 5-year follow-up. Recognizing that chronic otitis media is often not controlled by surgery, long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate a particular operative approach to control the disease and restore function. The purpose of this study is to reexamine the series of patients studied in 1981 and evaluate the status of the ear, as well as long-term functional results.

T1  - Retrospective analysis of tympanoplasty in children with cleft palate: a 24-year experience. II. Cholesteatomatous cases
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contradictory experience has been published on the outcomes of ear surgery in patients with cleft palate.OBJECTIVES: The authors of this study investigated whether there were differences in the short- and long-term outcomes of tympanoplasty performed due to cholesteatoma in children with or without cleft palate.SETTING: Tertiary care medical centre.METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed the first author's 24-year experience of paediatric tympanoplasty using the software programme developed by the fourth author. The outcomes of 268 tympanoplasties on 172 ears with cholesteatoma in 151 'NoCleft' patients were compared to the outcomes of 35 tympanoplasties on 20 ears of 19 'Cleft' patients. The average age of the patients was 10.7+/-3.6 years and 9.5+/-2.7 years respectively. The average follow-up time was 4 and 4.1 years.RESULTS: Preoperative PTA-ABGs (31.22/34.88 dB; p=0.058), best postoperative PTA-ABGs (17.04/16.4 dB; p=0.499), last postoperative PTA-ABGs (19.93/20.98 dB; p=0.298), the final hearing improvement (11.29/13.9 dB; p=0.193) and postoperative PTA-ABG deterioration with time (2.89/4.58 dB; p=0.117) were statistically compared between the 'NoCleft' and 'Cleft' groups. The same parameters were analyzed separately in the case of tympanoplasty performed with intact ossicular chain and the different type of columella ossiculoplasty. No significant differences were found between the two groups in any of these parameters. However, significant difference was found in the necessity for grommet insertion (8-fold difference, p=0), and conversion to open techniques (p=0).CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that the achievable audiological outcomes of tympanoplasty in children with cleft palate and cholesteatoma do not differ significantly from those of the general child population. However, this more frequently requires ventilation tube insertion and more frequent follow-up visits. The latter is ensured by patient care within the frameworks of the 'Cleft Palate Team'. We have to accept that in some cases Eustachian tube dysfunction caused by the underlying disease (cleft palate) 'takes over' and we have to resort to open techniques.

T1  - Hearing results with clothespin ossiculoplasty: preliminary report on the Kraus Modified Schuring Ossicle-Cup Prosthesis (Clothespin Prosthesis)
AB  - The clothespin partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) is designed to increase joint stability during incus replacement ossiculoplasty. Fundamental modifications have been made in the Schuring ossicle-cup, which include a forked well, increased well wall thickness and length, and a flexible tip disk added to the shaft. The forked well functions like a straight clothespin rather than an inverted cup. The forked well enables the clothespin prothesis to slide down over the stapes superstructure, between the facial nerve canal and the promontory, to form a stable, mortise-and-tenon prosthesis-stapedial joint. Joint stability is enhanced because the inferior tine of the forked well is able to lever against the inferior surface of the stapes superstructure, creating a counterforce to gravity. This is in contrast to the more unstable ball-and-socket joint created by most partial ossicular replacement prostheses when they articulate with the stapes capitulum. The addition of a flexible disk to the shaft tip produces a tight, stable union between the prosthesis and the ossicular cap by increasing resistance at the shaft-ossicle interface. Fluoroplastic composition maximizes intraoperative versatility and reliability while the ossicle cap minimizes extrusions. One-year hearing results for twelve chronic ear patients with mobile stapes undergoing clothespin ossiculoplasty during intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy revealed postoperative air-bone gaps within 20 dB in 92% of cases. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 8.9 dB, and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 14.4 dB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Intracranial complications of acute and chronic mastoiditis: report of two cases in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical picture of mastoiditis, sigmoid sinus thrombosis and brain abscess has changed with the advent of antibiotics. A delay in the recognition of intracranial complications in children and in the institution of appropriate therapy may result in morbidity and mortality. Increased mortality of the children has been correlated with the neurological status of the patient on admission to hospital.METHOD: A retrospective study was made of two children with acute mastoiditis and sigmoid sinus thrombosis and chronic mastoiditis with cerebellar abscess treated in 1997 in the ENT Department of the Medical University of Gdansk.RESULTS: We present two cases of intracranial complications in children (13 and 11 years old) originating from acute and chronic otitis media. The first case, of a 13-year-old boy with sigmoid sinus thrombosis as a complication of acute otitis media took its course as a typical Symonds Syndrome. Mastoidectomy, thrombectomy and jugular vein ligation associated with antibiotics and edema-reducing drugs and anticoagulants proved to be successful. The second case of an 11-year-old boy with exacerbated chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and mastoiditis, was complicated by suppurative meningitis, cerebellar abscess, perisinual abscess and sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis. Neurosurgical approach by suboccipital craniotomy and abscess drainage was ineffective. Otological treatments of modified radical mastoidectomy, thrombectomy, jugular vein ligation, perisinual and cerebellar abscess drainage associated with wide-spectrum antibiotics and edema-reducing drugs were performed with a very good outcome. After 3 years of follow-up the patients remain without any neurological and psychiatric consequences.CONCLUSION: The authors show different courses of both presented complications and imaging techniques and surgical procedures performed in these children. The sigmoid sinus trombosis with Symonds Syndrome may be difficult to diagnose due to previous antibiotics valuable in establishing the diagnosis and the extent of disease. The successful therapy is based on understanding of pathogenesis of the intracranial complication and the cooperation of an otolaryngologist, a neurologist, a neurosurgeon and an ophthalmologist.

T1  - Possible role of Helicobacter pylori in the etiopathogenesis of chronic otitis media
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate a possible contribution from Helicobacter pylori to the etiopathogenesis of chronic otitis media.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial.METHODS: Tympanomastoidectomy, radical mastoidectomy, and modified radical mastoidectomy procedures were performed according to the pathology of ear disease. Biopsy specimens were taken from middle ear, mastoid antrum, and tympanic orifice of eustachian tube. Helicobacter pylori DNA was extracted from these biopsy specimens by using nested polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori DNA was detected in 3 (7.9%) of 38 chronic otitis media patients.CONCLUSION: Even though it is possible to detect Helicobacter pylori in middle ear cleft in chronic otitis media, its role in the etiopathogenesis of the issue is controversial.

T1  - Deep temporalis fascia in tympanomastoid reconstruction
AB  - Various techniques have been described in the reconstruction of mastoidectomy cavity in an attempt to minimize or control the problems of persistent postoperative otorrhoea. We report the efficacy of deep temporalis fascia and its pedicled flap in 34 cases. Retrospective study method was used. There were 34 cases, 19 males and 13 females, the age ranged between 5 and 64 years, mean of 28 years. The clinical pathology included mastoiditis which was common to all the patients, others are middle ear polyp in 7, mastoid abscess 6, meningitis 4, lateral sinus thrombosis 3 and cholesteatoma 2. Comorbidity factors included diabetes mellitus in 2, moderate anaemia in 3 and septicaemia in 7. The procedures comprised of 18 modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) and 8 atticoantrostomy (AA) with lining of the resulting cavity and tympanoplasty using a pedicled temporalis fascia flap; and 8 cortical mastoidectomy (CM) and tympanoplasty using a graft. The success rate in terms of control of otorrhoea was 55% and there was no case of postoperative wound infection, an improvement compared to an earlier report. In addition there was a reduction in terms of postoperative hospital stay to an average of 9 days. We found the technique simple to learn and needing minimal equipment, hence relevant to otolaryngologic practice in a resource--poor environment. In addition the deep temporalis fascia is an autologous tissue with no risk of immune rejection. We recommend that mastoid reconstruction with the temporalis fascia becomes a routine in mastoidectomy so as to achieve control of chronic discharging ear, particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa where this is still predominant.

T1  - Intraoperative Bleeding and the Risk of Residual Cholesteatoma: A Multivariate Analysis
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Residual cholesteatoma most frequently occurs where visualization and surgical access are restricted by anatomic constraints. Other factors that compromise surgical field visualization might also increase rates of residual cholesteatoma. We evaluated whether impaired surgical field clarity from bleeding increases rates of residual cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary care hospital.PATIENTS: Consecutive series of children having intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma.INTERVENTIONS: Impact of bleeding on surgical field clarity was assessed intraoperatively on a six-point scale.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of residual cholesteatoma was established at follow up clinical encounters, second stage procedures, and with magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the influence of surgical field clarity and other factors on rates of residual cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Surgery was completed on 232 ears and residual cholesteatoma found in 45 (19%) ears. Multivariate regression analysis of cases completed with atticotomy or tympanoplasty demonstrated that surgical field clarity was a significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma (OR [odds ratio] 4, 95%CI 1.05-15; p = 0.04). Cholesteatoma extent was the most significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma when including cases requiring combined approach tympanomastoidectomy (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.4-3.3; p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Impaired surgical field clarity from intraoperative bleeding is associated with increased risk of residual cholesteatoma in surgery for meso/epitympanic cholesteatoma. These findings are of particular significance for endoscopic ear surgery in which management of bleeding can be more difficult and support the use of techniques, such as hypotensive general anesthesia, that minimize surgical site bleeding and improve surgical field visualization.

T1  - Complications of homograft tympanoplasty
AB  - The use of a homograft tympanic membrane with an attached malleus has provided an excellent alternative for reconstructing the severely damaged middle ear. I have limited homograft tympanoplasty to four specific indications: previous failure of standard tympanoplasty techniques, high risk of failure (total perforation, absent malleus, slag burns), reconstruction of radical mastoidectomy, and congenital aural atresia. Homograft tympanoplasty has provided a 94 per cent incidence of anatomic success in these severely damaged middle ears. Closure of the air-bone gap to within 25 dB. was accomplished in 85 per cent of these patients. Complications must be viewed in the perspective of the extensive disease in the middle ear that was being reconstructed. Only meticulous attention to surgical technique and postoperative care will provide the successes described by Wehrs, Marquet, Perkins, and others. The otologic surgeon is urged to observe the surgical techniques of homograft tympanoplasty rather than merely read about it. I believe that the transplant tympanic membrane should be used only when it provides an advantage over standard grafting techniques. Underlay fascia tympanoplasty yields excellent results in the majority of eardrum reconstructions. A final word about homograft tympanic membrane and ossicles. Although several "banks" for ear tissue are available in the United States, there are few established guidelines that these banks are required to follow. The otologic surgeon who uses homograft tissue must be guaranteed that the biologic product he is implanting in his patient is sterile, is anatomically perfect, has been stored in a chemically stable preservative, and has proven biologic effectiveness. Ear banks should be managed by surgeons who are using that tissue in their own patients, thus monitoring the tissue's quality. Each bank has a responsibility to donors, recipients, and surgeons to maintain the highest laboratory standards that will guarantee the quality of its product. Since there is no regulating agency, the practicing physician should insist that these standards for processed homograft ear tissue be maintained.

T1  - Open cavities in cholesteatoma surgery: checklist for proper surgery and perioperative care
AB  - Decisions in cholesteatoma surgery regarding open versus closed techniques are based on the extent of the cholesteatoma, the degree of pneumatization of the middle ear and mastoid and the integrity of the remaining mucosa following complete resection of all disease. Checklists regarding handling of the soft tissues, drilling of the temporal bone with complete exenteration of the tympanomastoid air cell tracts, lowering of the facial ridge, partial obliteration of the cavity and meatoplasty and postoperative care are presented. Adhering to these checklists should enable every otologic surgeon to perform a safe open cavity and to end up with a dry, mostly self-cleaning cavity.

T1  - A review of 50 cases of intracranial complications from otogenic infection between 1961 and 1977
AB  - The records of 50 patients with intracranial complications of middle ear disease treated over the past 16 years have been reviewed. Virtually all the known intracranial consequences of middle ear infection have been encountered, and include cerebral abscess, cerebellar abscess, meningitis, lateral sinus thrombosis, otitic hydrocephalus and cortical thrombophlebitis. The clinical features, neurological signs and investigative data for each group have been compared and contrasted. Treatment in the past has consisted of radical and modified radical mastoidectomy. It is proposed that these techniques will continue to be preferred for the management of chronic otitis media in the presence of a condition as serious as an intracranial complication. It is concluded that with a quoted incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma as high as 40% intact canal wall techniques are not justified in these patients at present.

T1  - The results of two years operation of the visiting specialist service to the Waikato mobile ear clinic
AB  - AIM: To review the function and results of the Health Waikato mobile ear clinic service 1993-4.METHOD: Data were collected on all children reviewed at the fortnightly specialist clinics conducted in the mobile ear clinics during 1993-4. An overall pathological assessment of the middle ear and eardrum was made for each ear.RESULTS: Of the 467 children examined 311 children were wait listed for elective surgery. Pathology ranged from recurrent acute otitis media to cholesteatoma. Large numbers of children were found with atelectasis of the tympanic membrane. Children as young as seven years of age required modified radical mastoidectomy for treatment of otorrhea due to cholesteatoma.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey show the mobile ear clinic service requires a large amount of resources to operate. The mobile ear clinic generates a large operative workload which creates an imbalance between resources devoted to finding the disease and those devoted to treating it. Recommendations include a tighter integration between the mobile ear clinic and the hospital, and appropriate allocation of treatment services to treat the children identified by the service.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula as a complication of cholesteatoma
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to present the authors' experience in the management of labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma.METHODS: The clinical charts of 92 patients who underwent surgical procedures for cholesteatoma complicated by labyrinthine fistula between 1979 and 1975 were reviewed retrospectively. In this period, 1,205 patients were operated on for cholesteatoma. In each patient, the site and size of the fistula were evaluated during surgery and the hearing thresholds were compared before and after surgery.RESULTS: The fistula involved the lateral semicircular canal in 71 patients. Multiple fistulas were observed in nine patients. Postoperative hearing levels were unchanged or improved in 83.7% of patients. Comparison between hearing outcomes and size of the fistula showed better findings when smaller size fistulas were found. No significant differences between open and closed techniques were detected. Favorable outcomes were obtained in patients treated with surgical obliteration of the interrupted labyrinth.CONCLUSIONS: The current study confirmed that careful manipulation of the labyrinthine fistula is mandatory to preserve hearing functions for these patients. According to the authors' experience, the future trend for fistula treatment could be directed toward less conservative techniques compared with the previous indications favoring methods of interruption and subsequent obliteration of the semicircular canals.

T1  - Modified intact canal wall mastoidectomy - long term results in hearing and healing
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The classic intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (combined approach tympanoplasty) [1, 2] has anatomic constraints for clearance of disease from the anterior attic and sinus tympani leading to high recidivism. Farrior [3, 4] described the modification of this technique and senior author (AM) has been using it with further modifications since 1973.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report our long-term experience in hearing and healing in 126 cases with special reference to the age (pediatric versus adults), ossicle status (presence or absence of stapes suprastructure) and type of cholesteatoma (Attic versus posterior-superior versus secondary acquired cholesteatoma).RESULTS: All the patients had unsafe CSOM and underwent Modified ICW mastoidectomy with primary ossiculoplasty except five where the procedure was staged.CONCLUSION: Modified ICW technique is a one-stage procedure with the lowest recidivism rate when compared to various other ICW techniques. There is no significant difference in relation to age of the patient or type of cholesteatoma if the operative cases are selected judicially.

T1  - Role of CT Mastoids in the Diagnosis and Surgical Management of Chronic Inflammatory Ear Diseases
AB  - Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation of middle ear cleft. It presents with discharging ear and decreased hearing. The diagnosis is mostly on clinical examination with otoscope or oto endoscope. Computerised Tomography (CT) of mastoids is done to evaluate the extent of the disease and its complication. High resolution CT is now the investigation of choice for temporal bone disease. This study emphasizes on the importance of CT scan in diagnosis of inflammatory ear diseases and most importantly identifying pitfalls or complications which a surgeon can come across during surgery. The aims and objectives of this study is (1) to establish the efficacy of CT in the diagnosis of the complications and surgical management of chronic inflammatory pathologies of middle ear. (2) To find subgroups of CSOM where CT is particularly useful. In this series, a total of 25 cases presenting to our OPD at Govt. ENT Hospital between 2013 and 2014 have been diagnosed and findings of surgery correlated with HRCT scan of temporal bones done preoperatively. In this study, 64 % of the patients were male and incidence of CSOM with patients undergoing surgery belonged to the age group 21-30 years (32 %). The most common presenting symptom was ear discharge (92 %) and decreased hearing (96 %). The most common type of pathology in this study was attic perforation (36 %) and granulations (40 %) followed by cholesteatoma (36 %) and mucosal edema (16 %). Not all cases presented with complications, facial palsy (12 %) and mastoid abscess (8 %) were among few complications seen. 14 patients (56 %) of 25 cases underwent simple cortical mastoidectomy followed by 9 cases (36 %) for modified radical mastoidectomy and atticotomy for 2 cases (8 %). CT scan findings correlated well with surgical findings for cholesteatoma, middle ear mass and bone erosions. Where as for ossicular integrity and facial canal dehiscence, there was a discrepancy.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: results in open versus closed techniques
AB  - Cholesteatoma in children presents characteristics that differentiate it from the adult condition. Surgery has been performed in 55 ears. The main reason for referral was otorrhoea (83 per cent), either alone (29 per cent) or with hearing loss (54 per cent). Apart from three cases with an intact eardrum, a perforation was always present mostly posterior-superior (50 per cent). Open techniques were performed in 27.3 per cent of the ears and the closed technique in 72.7 per cent. Only in 18 per cent of cases was the ossicular chain normal and mobile. The attic was occupied by cholesteatoma in 79 per cent. Recurrence took place in 37 per cent and 13 per cent of the closed and open techniques respectively. Open techniques tend to be employed in the presence of extensive disease, whereas the closed technique is reserved for those with a more localized problem.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in patients with congenital external auditory canal anomalies: retrospective review
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review cases of congenital external auditory canal anomaly with cholesteatoma, documenting clinical presentation, cholesteatoma site and extent, complications, and surgery.METHOD: Retrospective review of all cases of congenital canal anomaly with cholesteatoma treated between 1998 and 2009.RESULTS: Of 41 cases with canal anomalies, 17 (43.9 per cent) had associated cholesteatoma. Medical records were unretrievable for four cases. Of the remaining 13 patients (five females and eight males, age range four to 73 years, mean 21 years), 10 presented chiefly with recurrent otorrhoea, two with postauricular discharge from mastoid abscess, and one with otalgia, postauricular tenderness and neck stiffness. Hearing loss was conductive in 10 patients (76.9 per cent) and sensorineural (severe to profound) in three. No facial nerve palsy was documented. Cholesteatoma was seen in all cases on high resolution computed tomography, and confirmed intra-operatively. Six patients underwent canalplasty with split skin grafting, and seven modified radical mastoidectomy. Six patients recovered well, two needed repeated canalplasty for soft tissue restenosis, and five needed cautery and split skin grafting for mastoid cavity granulation tissue.CONCLUSION: Congenital canal anomaly is uncommon. Canal cholesteatoma should be suspected in all cases, and high resolution temporal bone computed tomography undertaken in all patients aged four years or more. In patients with otorrhoea, the risk of cholesteatoma is greater. Treatment is generally surgery; the type depends on the disease extent.

T1  - Endoscopic 'second look' mastoidoscopy to rule out residual epitympanic/mastoid cholesteatoma
AB  - Endoscopic mastoidoscopy is ideally suited for patients who have undergone an intact canal wall mastoidectomy for primary acquired cholesteatoma confined to the epitympanum and mastoid. The use of an endoscopic technique significantly decreases the morbidity of the second-look procedure. Visualization of the pertinent anatomy can be reliably, quickly, and safely accomplished.

T1  - Management of childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - We report a retrospective study of 54 children with 57 involved ears who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma before their sixteenth birthdays. The majority of these underwent open cavity operations (modified radical mastoidectomy, radical mastoidectomy or atticotomy). The incidence of residual disease was only 6 per cent and overall 70 per cent of ears have been free of chronic discharge. The post-operative hearing thresholds were disappointingly low, though overall no worse than those recorded before surgery. The mean post-operative hearing level for the group was 39 dB and the mean air-bone gap was 29 dB. Open cavity surgery is the method of choice for childhood cholesteatoma, mainly because of the low incidence of residual disease.

T1  - Problems in diagnosis and treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Our clinical study includes 56 cases of cholesteatoma in children aged 3-14 years, treated in a 6-year period. Cholesteatoma was localized in attic (6 cases), in middle ear (6 cases), in attic plus middle ear (16 cases) and in attic + middle ear + mastoid (28 cases or 50% of the total number). In the surgical treatment combined approach tympanoplasty (intact canal wall technique) was used in 76.8%, radical tympanomastoidectomy in 16.1%, and other techniques in 7.1%. Intact ossicular chain was found in 25%. Reconstruction of the ossicular chain (including autograft, homograft and allograft material) was done in 59%, and the remaining 16% were treated by classic radical surgery. Hearing results: unchanged, 48%; improved, 45%; slightly worsened, 7%; and no dead ear. Recurrency in 31% is considerably higher as compared to 15% in adults found in another comparable study by us.

T1  - Recurrence of Cholesteatoma - A Retrospective Study Including 1,006 Patients for More than 33 Years
AB  - Introduction Cholesteatomas are benign tumors consisting of skin, and growing inside a retraction pocket in the tympanic membrane. Cholesteatomas can occupy the entirety of the middle ear, and are known for their osteolytic capabilities. Surgery is the only curative treatment for cholesteatomas. Objective To describe the risk of recurrence after first-time surgically-treated middle-ear cholesteatoma (STMEC1) on the island of Funen from 1983 to 2015. Methods Cases of STMEC1 were identified in the Danish National Hospital Register. The medical records were reviewed. Time-to-event analyses were applied. The ears were followed from STMEC1 to a secondary cholesteatoma, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Results Records from 1,006 patients with STMEC1 were reviewed. A total of 54 patients were submitted to surgery on both ears. The total sample consisted of 1,060 ears with STMEC1; 300 were children's (< 16 years) ears, and 760 were adult's ears. The total observation time was of 12,049 years. The overall estimated proportion with recurrence 5 years after surgery was of 37% in children and of 15% in adults. The older the child was at the first surgery, the risk decreased by 7% per year. In children, canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy without obliteration was associated with a hazard ratio for recurrence of 1.9 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 1.2-3.0) compared with CWU with obliteration. Conclusion Compared with adults, children were had 2.6 times more risk of recurrence. Procedures performed without mastoidectomy had the lowest risk of recurrence. In children, obliteration was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence. However, patients were not randomized regarding the surgical approach; thus, the association between approach and risk of recurrence was likely influenced by confounding factors.

T1  - Pathogenesis of cholesteatoma based on clinical results of anterior tympanotomy
AB  - A new conception of the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma is proposed based on clinical results of anterior tympanotomy, a procedure developed in order to prevent recurrence of cholesteatoma following retraction pocket formation after canal-up operation. In the cholesteatomatous ear, there is always a long, thick bony septum between the epitympanum and the supratubal recess. This septum is called the anterior attic bony plate, forming the tympanic diaphragm together with the tensor tympani mucosal fold. In anterior tympanotomy, this bony plate is removed finishing intact canal wall mastoidectomy, making a new ventilating route to the eustachian tube. With this technique, the rate of recurrence was reduced from 17 to 5%. Based on these results it is proposed that the real pathogenesis of cholesteatoma is not tubal dysfunction, but the osseous tympanic diaphragm.

T1  - Long-term outcome of modified radical mastoidectomy
AB  - The primary aim of treatment of cholesteatoma is to attain a dry, safe, stable ear, free of disease. Maintaining or improving hearing is important but the pursuit of a hearing result should not compromise this primary aim. This study reviews the long-term outcome of 133 patients, suffering from advanced disease, who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy between 1995 and 2000. Of these, 49 per cent had had previous mastoid surgery elsewhere. A dry, waterproof ear was attained in 95 per cent of patients. In 77 per cent of patients, hearing was unchanged or improved. In this period, there were two cases of significant post-operative loss in bone conduction, including one dead ear secondary to suppurative labyrinthitis. There were epithelial pearls on follow up in two per cent. These results indicate that when properly performed, modified radical mastoidectomy provides safe surgical access and clears disease with low recurrence rates while mostly maintaining or improving hearing.

T1  - Reconstruction of the middle ear with tragal cartilage
AB  - A surgical technique for reconstruction of a well-ventilated middle ear space using tragal cartilage has been developed. Our technique was designed so as to secure an atticoantrum cavity and a complement of posterior tympanic annulus with a cartilage. This technique can be utilized in a radical mastoidectomy cavity at an original surgery and at a revision.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Treating cholesteatoma in children is still controversial. This article reviews 93 cases of pediatric cholesteatoma operated on from 1983 to 1991 in the Gruppo Otologico, Placenza, Italy, and details the results in 83 children who underwent the intact canal wall technique. During second-stage surgery, residual cholesteatoma was detected in 38% of patients. Recurrent cholesteatoma was detected in 10% of patients treated with the intact canal wall technique. Residual cholesteatoma was seen in the middle ear cleft in 63%, in the epitympanum in 26%, and in the mastoid in 11% of cases. Social hearing level (< 25 dB) was achieved in 85% of cases with suprastructure, whereas only 53% of patients without suprastructure had these levels. In the treatment of cholesteatoma in children by use of the intact canal wall technique, a preplanned second-look operation is mandatory to eradicate the disease.

T1  - A retrospective analysis of the intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy
AB  - A retrospective analysis of patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media, cholesterol granuloma, and cholesteatoma between 1971 and 1979 was performed. The prevalence of postoperative cholesteatoma was higher than that previously reported in the literature. This emphasizes the need to re-explore patients who have had intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy performed for the removal of cholesteatoma. The elimination of cavity problems and better functional results must be balanced against the need for a second operation when an intact canal wall procedure for cholesteatoma is considered. Cholesteatomas occurring in children appear to be more aggressive than those occurring in adults.

T1  - Surgical management of labyrinthine fistulae in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma by a one-stage closed technique
AB  - Twenty cases of labyrinthine fistulae have been reviewed. From 1979 to 1987, 234 patients with cholesteatomatous ears were operated on by one surgeon, 20 of these had a labyrinthine fistula (incidence 8.6%). In 75% only the lateral semicircular canal was involved and in 25% the other semicircular canals and/or the cochlea were involved. The fistula test was positive in 50% of the cases. The surgical technique used in all 20 cases was a one-stage closed tympanoplasty, i.e. removal of the cholesteatoma matrix, covering of the fistula with fascia and bone, obliteration of the cavity and reconstruction of the meatal wall. 76% of the patients achieved a hearing improvement, while 1 patient had anacusis (5%). The results indicate that it is possible in one stage to remove the cholesteatoma matrix from the fistula and still be able to restore useful hearing in the majority of the patients.

T1  - Long-term results of open cavity and tympanomastoid surgery of the chronic ear
AB  - The results of surgery for chronic middle ear infection in 307 patients (347 ears) are reported. All ears were operated on according to one of two procedures: (i) the operative cavity was left open after removal of the posterior canal wall, or (ii) a tympanomastoidectomy with intact canal wall was done. When necessary, removal of disease in the tympanum with or without reconstruction of the sound-conducting mechanism of the middle ear was performed. Cholesteatoma was present in 56% of the ears. Open cavity surgery with no reconstruction was done in 53%. In the remaining 47%, tympanomastoidectomy was performed and in approx. half of these ears reconstruction was undertaken. The postoperative follow-up period averaged 9 years. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 9%. In 4% of the ears undergoing tympanomastoidectomy a retraction pocket cholesteatoma developed. During the follow-up period 13% of the ears required revision surgery. Nineteen per cent of the ear with open cavities were discharging and, in addition, crusts were observed in 13%. In the tympanomastoidectomy group, discharing ears were seen in 26%. As a rule, hearing was not affected by surgery. The mean elevation of the pure tone threshold was 6.5 dB on account of sensorineural loss, while the speech reception threshold shift was 11 dB. The results testify to the importance of removing the posterior canal wall in ears with chronic middle ear infection associated with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Staged surgery in ears with excessive disease of tympanum
AB  - Results regarding tympanic healing and hearing improvement are reported in a series of 84 one-stage operations on the middle ear, using thin silicone elastomer sheeting, and of 76 two-stage operations using temporary filling of the middle ear with paraffin wax, and of ten with silicone elastomer sponge. All epithelium was removed from the tympanic cleft at the primary operation. Staging of the operation gave better hearing results and resulted in fewer adhesive middle ears. Middle ear mucosal biopsies from ears with mucus production around the paraffin showed an increased number of glands and secreting epithelial cells, much as in glue ears. Residual or recurrent cholesteatoma appeared in only 2.4%, which is attributed to resection of the posterior canal wall in cases of cholesteatoma, as contrasted with the intact canal wall technique.

T1  - Labyrinthectomy: Our Experience in a Tertiary Care Centre
AB  - Labyrinthectomy is an effective surgical procedure for the management of poorly compensated unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction in the presence of a nonserviceable hearing. It involves removal of labyrinthine portion of the inner ear and exenteration of the neuroepithelium. In our institution, 8 cases underwent surgical labyrinthectomy from a period of 2013-2018 for various extensive disease manifestations, age ranges from 2 to 48 years. Includes, a child of 2 years age presented with bilateral foul smelling otorrhoea with external auditory canal cartilaginous stenosis, 5 cases of extensive cholesteatoma with labrynthitis and 2 cases of purulent labrynthitis among them 1 were suffering from Tuberculosis and was on Category 1 ATT and other one suffering from extensive granulation at the tympanomastoid area which was inconclusive of the diagnosis even after histopathological examination, so treated as tuberculosis and started on prophylactic antitubercular treatment in addition to surgery. All patients except the child gave past history of giddiness, but at the time of presentation they were not having giddiness or noticeable nystagmus and all had profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Thus all the patients underwent a radical mastoidectomy with total labyrinthectomy and blind sac closure in 2 patients. Copyright Â© Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2019.

T1  - Modified radical mastoidectomy: a relook at the surgical pitfalls
AB  - The primary aim of surgery for cholesteatoma is to eliminate the disease, to produce a safe and dry ear which is self cleansing, modify the anatomy of the tympanomastoid compartment so as to prevent recurrent disease and wherever possible to reconstruct the hearing mechanism. The advances in medical technology and the medical expertise gained over a period of time have greatly influenced the results in cholesteatoma surgery. The aim of the present study was to assess the intraoperative findings during revision mastoid surgery for atticoantral disease and to ascertain the preventable factor that could reduce recurrence. A retrospective analysis of all clinical data and operative notes of patients who had undergone revision surgery for recurrent cholesteatoma, in our unit in a tertiary care centre in south India over a period of 3 years from July 2007 to July 2010 was done. 33 patients had undergone revision mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma. Most patients presented with symptoms and sign of disease about 2 years after the first surgery. The commonest complaint was recurrent foul smelling ear discharge. The most frequent site of recurrent cholesteatoma was the tip cells (72%) and the most important cause for failure of surgery with recurrence of disease was inadequate meatoplasty (70%). In our study, recurrent disease was likely due to cholesteatoma in the tip cells left uncleared and inadequate meatoplasty. Both these issues reflect faulty techniques in performing good meatoplasty or the tip cell are not adequately reduced into the external auditory canal. Bone work is generally taught well in all temporal bone workshops but no emphasis is laid on soft tissue work hence the failure and recurrence. Thus we emphasize the need to teach the budding otologists the importance of and proper technique of meatoplasty.

T1  - Acute mastoid abscess and cholesteatoma
AB  - A 10-year review of acute mastoid abscess treated surgically in Belfast revealed a total of 24 cases, 12 of which were found to have an underlying cholesteatoma. The surgical management of these 12 cases is outlined but despite a desire to maintain an intact canal wall, 9 of them to date have ended up with an open cavity. The danger of conservative management and the possible association between acute mastoid abscess and cholesteatoma, especially in developed countries, is stressed.

T1  - Chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma
AB  - Cholesteatoma may arise because of a number of events, but serous otitis media appears to be the precursor in the majority of instances. Whether one enters into conservative, simple excision of the keratotic mass or a more extensive modified radical mastoidectomy or radical exteriorizing procedure will depend upon whether the cholesteatoma is in a very small "pearl-like" mass, confined to a limited area, or whether it is dispersed to the point where total eradication is all but impossible.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula from cholesteatoma: surgical management
AB  - Labyrinthine fistula is a complication of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma which can result in progressive sensory hearing loss or permanent loss of inner ear function. Total surgical removal of cholesteatoma and use of the intact canal wall tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy can result in preservation or improvement of hearing and elimination of vertigo. Long-term results in a series of 63 cases are reported. The important features of surgical technique involve use of high magnification with the operating microscope, a high-speed drill, suction irrigation and thorough knowledge of temporal bone anatomy. In addition, the surgeon must avoid tearing or perforation of the squamous epithelium basement membrane during dissection. In some cases, sensory hearing returns to normal following surgery, making a successful second-stage reconstruction for hearing possible.

T1  - Closed tympanoplasty in cholesteatoma surgery: long-term (10 years) hearing results using cartilage ossiculoplasty
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term hearing results of using costal cartilage prostheses in ossicular chain reconstruction procedures in subjects operated on for a middle ear cholesteatoma with an intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Thirty-six patients (four with bilateral disease) followed up for 10 years who underwent an ossiculoplasty with a cartilage prostheses between January 1987 and December 1989 constituted the population studied. All the subjects underwent a staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. Ossiculoplasty with total or partial chondroprosthesis was performed during the second stage. The long-term outcome was evaluated in terms of hearing according to the guidelines of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium (1995), and in terms of complications (anatomical and functional). In 18 patients a partial cartilage ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was used, while in 22 a total cartilage ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) was used. In the PORP group the mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 22.4 dB hearing level (HL); before the second stage the ABG was 37.9 dB HL, at 2 years it was 12.1 dB HL, at 5 years 15.3 dB HL and at 10 years 15.8 dB HL. In the TORP group the mean preoperative ABG was 31.6 dB HL; before the second stage the ABG was 41.1 dB HL, at 2 years it was 14.4 dB HL, at 5 years 17 dB HL and at 10 years 18.5 dB HL. In both groups the number of cases with a postoperative ABG of < 20 dB HL remained stable (P > 0.05) over time. The failure rate was 17.5%, but only in 5% of cases was a functional revision needed. No cases of extrusion of the prostheses were encountered. The use of a chondroprosthesis is associated with functional results similar to those obtained by other authors. The efficacy of the prostheses remains stable over time and is associated with a very low rate of complications and failures. In this series no extrusion occurred and in no case did an infectious disease develop after cartilage transplantation.

T1  - Hearing results using titanium ossicular replacement prosthesis in intact canal wall tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: Titanium proved to be a valuable alternative to ossicles in ossiculoplasty procedures. Complication rates are comparable to those obtained by other authors with titanium and nontitanium prostheses. Hearing results were worse compared with other reports; however, no conclusion can be drawn on the basis of the literature because of the heterogeneity of the populations studied.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the results and complications of total (TORP) and partial (PORP) titanium ossicular replacement prostheses in middle ear cholesteatoma.METHODS: Fifty-seven patients affected by acquired cholesteatoma of the middle ear undergoing titanium ossiculoplasty during second stage intact canal wall tympanoplasty were evaluated. Postoperative hearing gain, complication rate, and revision rate were analyzed.RESULTS: Average postoperative gain was 13.6 dB HL for PORP and 17.9 dB HL for TORP. After ossicular reconstruction the mean postoperative ABG was 24.1 dB HL in PORPs and 27.2 dB HL in TORPs. The difference in air-bone gap (ABG) between the two groups after ossiculoplasty was not significant. The number of patients with an ABG > 30 dB was higher in the TORP group compared with the PORP group (p = 0.024) after ossicular reconstruction. The total extrusion rate was 5.2% and the total revision rate was 10.5%.

T1  - Hearing results after cholesteatoma surgery: the Iowa experience
AB  - This study compared the hearing outcome of canal-up and canal-down mastoidectomies for removal of cholesteatoma in 455 ears. An intact canal wall procedure was performed in 92 patients while the remainder (N = 363) underwent a canal-down operation. The hearing results for both procedures are dependent on the presence of the stapes superstructure. When the stapes superstructure was intact, 52% of the patients with canal-up operations had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The corresponding figure for canal-down cases was 37%. When there was no stapes superstructure, 54% of the canal-up cases and 19% of the canal-down cases obtained a similar ABG closure. Preserving the posterior external auditory canal wall results in slightly better hearing function. However, when the stapes superstructure is intact, the difference in hearing function is not remarkable, and must be weighed against the potential for residual disease or recurrence associated with canal-up procedures.

T1  - Management of temporal bone meningo-encephalocoele
AB  - UNLABELLED: Meningo-encephalocoele of the temporal bone, also known as fungus cerebri, is a rare occurrence in clinical practice. We present a series of 13 patients with chronic otitis media who suffered brain herniation into the mastoid cavity. We also discuss the presentation and management of brain herniation with or without cerebrospinal fluid leak.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective.METHODS: Among 963 cases undergoing revision mastoid surgery, 13 patients suffered brain herniation. These cases were identified and analysed.RESULTS: All 13 patients' initial diagnosis was chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma, and all had undergone previous mastoid surgery resulting in a defect in the tegmen and weakening of the dura mater. The revision procedures performed included 10 (76.9 per cent) modified radical mastoidectomies without ossicular chain reconstruction and one (7.6 per cent) modified radical mastoidectomy with ossicular chain reconstruction; two (15.3 per cent) patients required a blind sac closure. Brain herniation and/or cerebrospinal fluid leak were repaired by a transmastoid +/- minicraniotomy procedure.CONCLUSIONS: Injury to the tegmen and dura should be avoided during surgery for chronic middle-ear disease. Cerebrospinal fluid leaks, if encountered, should be managed in the same surgical session. The transmastoid approach is helpful in repairing defects smaller than 1 cm in diameter, whereas the combined transmastoid-minicraniotomy approach provides good access when closing defects larger than 1 cm in diameter and also enables auto-calvarial grafting.

T1  - Mastoid surgery: effect of retained mucosa on healing
AB  - Variation in the quality of healing in mastoid cavities has never been clearly understood. It is the author's contention that the factor responsible for the wide variation in healing, even though all chronic disease has been removed, is buried mucosa which leads to cystic formation. Over the past 20 years the author has followed the principle of removing all mucosa from the mastoid segment and has been rewarded with dry ears routinely in open cavity surgery. For the past 12 years he has removed cholesteatoma through tympanoplasty and modified radical mastoidectomy. These cases, also, have been consistently free of cavity problems. In the late 50s and early 60s closed cavity operations were tried in radical mastoidectomy, fenestration and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. Postoperative healing difficulties were encountered then that are similar to those being reported now with intact canal wall operation. No conclusions are drawn in the controversy between open and closed cavity techniques. The observation may be made, nevertheless, that the problems of closed cavity operations have not been solved. It is the thesis of this paper that the main objection to open cavity operations, ie, poor quality of healing, has been resolved.

T1  - Influence of surgical technique on residual cholesteatoma location and prevalence
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Compared to canal wall up (CWU) tympanoplasty, canal wall reconstruction (CWR) allows better visualization of cholesteatoma extension. The canal wall up approach provides good functional outcomes, but with higher rates of residual cholesteatoma. The aim of this study was to compare residual cholesteatoma prevalence and location between the two approaches.METHOD: Subjects were adult patients with residual cholesteatoma following CWU or CWR surgery between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. During this period, 94 patients underwent CWU and 71 CWR; 22 presented with residual cholesteatoma: 16 after CWU (R-CWU group) and 6 after CWR (R-CWR group).RESULTS: There was no significant inter-group difference in residual cholesteatoma prevalence: 17% after CWU, 8.4% after CWR. Locations comprised: 13 (81%) in the attic, 9 (56%) in the tympanic cavity and 4 (25%) in the mastoid in the R-CWU group, and 6 (100%) in the attic in the R-CWR group. There were significantly fewer tympanic cavity locations after CWR compared to CWU (P=0.046).CONCLUSION: Residual cholesteatoma prevalence did not significantly differ between the CWU and CWR approaches. The most frequent location was the attic; significantly more locations were in the tympanic cavity with the CWU approach. These findings are important for surgeons and neuro-radiologists during follow-up. Copyright Â© 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

T1  - Transcanal atticoaditotomy and transcortical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: the Farrior-Olaizola technique revisited
AB  - Conservative mastoid surgery in the management of middle ear cholesteatoma has been a subject of controversy for decades. Proponents of the combined-approach tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma do not entirely support the conservative approach in children, especially in the hands of an inexperienced surgeon. We describe here our experience with a modified technique of conservative mastoid surgery involving an atticoaditotomy and a separate simple mastoidectomy with lateral attic wall reconstruction (modified Farrior technique) that can be relatively safely used in the majority of cases of chronic squamous otitis media, even in children. This was a prospective analysis of the therapeutic effects and benefits of the technique used in 103 cases of cholesteatoma at Staffordshire General Hospital from 1991 to 1997. The follow-up was between 3 and 9 years. The study group consisted of 55 male patients and 48 female patients, including 28 children less than 16 years of age. The age ranges were 9 to 61 years in male patients and 10 to 48 years in female patients. After an audiological assessment, all patients underwent the described mastoid procedure, and some of them required revision surgery, mostly for a second look or for ossiculoplasty. The chief outcome measures used were complete eradication of disease, incidence of disease recurrence, and restoration of hearing. The steps of the procedure, its pros and cons, and the results of the series are presented. Also discussed is an overview of the literature pertaining to intact-canal wall mastoid surgery. Of the 103 patients, only 3 had a recurrence of disease, and 9 patients showed no hearing improvement. We conclude that this modified technique has several advantages over the previously described mastoidectomy procedures. It is a relatively simple and effective technique that can be performed even in children.

T1  - Management of tegmen defects with mastoid and epitympanic obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the surgical results and complications in a cohort of patients operated on to repair a tegmen bony defect using either transmastoid approach with obliteration using S53P4 bioactive glass granules (TMA-O), or the classic middle cranial fossa approach (MCFA).Study design: A retrospective monocentric study.Methods: Twenty-five cases (24 patients) were included. Data regarding patient demographics, etiology, intraoperative findings, complications, recurrences, audiometric data, and follow-up were analyzed.Results: Seven patients were operated with MCFA and 17 patients with TMA-O. One patient was operated on using a combined approach (MCFA + TMA-O). In the preoperative HRCT scan, the size of the defect was estimated to be 6 +/- 3.8 mm in the TMA-O group and 6 +/- 3.5 mm in the MCFA group (P = .969). Intraoperatively, in the MCFA group, the location of the defect was mostly anterior (86%) with an intact ossicular chain (86%). A discontinuous chain was observed in 15 patients (88%) in the TMA-O group. The mean follow-up time was 22 +/- 14 months in the TMA-O group and 24 +/- 15 months in the MCFA group (P = .762). In both groups, there were no early postoperative complications or recurrences during follow-up.Conclusion: Repair of a tegmen bony defect with S53P4 bioactive glass granules seems to be safe and effective, limiting the use of the middle cranial fossa approach to cases with epitympanic defects and with an intact ossicular chain, and it could be used whatever the size of the defect and/or the presence of meningoencephalocele.Level of evidence: 4.

T1  - The management of congenital cholesteatoma: surgical results of 42 cases
AB  - Radical surgery for congenital cholesteatoma leaves the patient, usually a child, with an ear that requires care for life. At the Otologic Medical Group, the intact canal wall technique has been used for many patients with cholesteatoma. To determine results of this management in the treatment of congenital cholesteatoma, we reviewed records of all patients treated between 1974 and 1985. Forty-two ears were studied in 41 patients. A closed middle-ear space was achieved in all cases, and an intact canal wall was maintained in 41 (98%). Follow-up averaged 4.3 years. Of the 41 cases with serviceable hearing before surgery, 28 (68%) had postoperative hearing within 10 dB of the best preoperative bone conduction threshold. Thirty-eight of the 41 achieved a final hearing result within 20 dB of the best bone conduction threshold.

T1  - The use of ventilation tubes and the incidence of cholesteatoma surgery in the paediatric population of Liverpool
AB  - Many surgeons believe that grommet insertion has reduced the incidence of cholesteatoma and thus radical mastoidectomy. Several causes for this trend have been postulated, including the increased use of ventilation tubes to treat otitis media with effusion. We have studied the number of operations for cholesteatoma, together with the number of ventilation tube insertions in the paediatric population of Liverpool, over a 28-year period between 1963 and 1990. There was a decline in the number of operations for cholesteatoma and an increase in the use of ventilation tubes, but there was no significant correlation between the two. This suggests that other factors are responsible for the decline in surgery for cholesteatoma.

T1  - Outcomes of the overlay graft technique in tympanoplasty
AB  - BACKGROUND: This audit was undertaken to review the outcomes achieved with the overlay graft technique of tympanic membrane repair in tympanoplasty surgery.METHODS: The charts of all patients who underwent tympanoplasty, in whom an overlay graft technique of temporalis fascia tympanic membrane repair was used, between 1994 and 2007 were reviewed. Information with respect to patient demographics, presence of cholesteatoma or active infection and perforation size was documented. Details of the surgical procedure and clinical outcomes and pre- and post-operative hearing thresholds were recorded in a computer database.RESULTS: A total of 147 overlay graft procedures were performed in 130 patients. Graft failure with reperforation occurred following five procedures, for an overall success rate of 96.6%. Eighty Type 1 tympanoplasty procedures were performed in which one failure occurred for a 98.75% success rate. Overlay grafting was combined with intact canal wall mastoidectomy (ICW) in 38 cases and with modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) in 17 cases for a success rate of 93.8 and 95%, respectively. Delayed graft healing as a result of infection, problems such as epithelial pearl, blunting and myringitis occurred in 39 cases (26.5%). Thirty-one cases underwent procedures for ossicular chain reconstruction, 21 of which were 2nd stage procedures. Hearing outcomes were significantly better with Type 1 tympanoplasty compared with ICW or MRM procedures.CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates the overlay graft technique of tympanoplasty to be highly successful for tympanic membrane repair, particularly for the more difficult cases such as revision surgery, subtotal perforations and mesotympanic cholesteatoma.

T1  - Treatment of cholesteatoma
AB  - Clinicians view cholesteatoma as a middle ear condition in which stratified squamous epithelium produces non-self-cleansing amounts of keratin. This clinical definition includes retraction pockets as well as big, deep-seated epidermoids. The two may have different origins, and they often require different therapeutic approaches. Clearance and control of shallow retraction pockets may be achieved with suction cleaning. Larger or longstanding retraction pockets, if not too deep, may be excised, and the tympanic membrane grafted. Deep-seated cholesteatomas require more elaborate surgery, whether they involve advanced retraction pockets or big and deep-seated middle ear epidermoids. The intact wall technique, though elegant, has about a 50% failure rate, regardless of the surgeon's skill. The failures are due to either retraction pocket formation, with or without posterior wall atrophy or the reappearance of epidermoids (so-called residual disease). Reconstruction of the bony defect in the scutum does not prevent retraction pocket formation. It is obvious that an approach that envisages successful removal of the matrix as curing the disease is too simplified. The intact wall operation should be reserved for ears with extensive mastoid pneumatization and small cholesteatomas. Most ears with cholesteatoma (85%) are, however, poorly pneumatized and they fare best with a small radical conservative (modified) mastoidectomy. The procedure should aim at creating the smallest mastoid cavity possible. Small mastoid cavities, possessing a tympanic membrane, an adequate mastoplasty, and no recess behind the facial ridge, will be found to be dry in about 90% of cases. A technique for achieving a minimal mastoid cavity is described.

T1  - Surgical planning of the treatment of cholesteatoma and postoperative follow-up
AB  - There is no single surgical treatment of choice for aural cholesteatoma. The extent of the cholesteatoma, the amount of preoperative destruction, and the size of the mastoid pneumatization should guide the surgeon in choosing the type of operation for a particular ear--which may range from a simple extraction of the cholesteatoma (delivery) all the way to a radical mastoidectomy. It is the clinical acumen that will determine the type of surgery for a given cholesteatomatous ear, algorithms being of little use in the complex situation of a pathological condition with infinite variables. However, even when the most suitable surgical modality is chosen by the best of surgeons, the operated ear will still be left with the innate cause of the cholesteatoma, namely, its physiopathologic background and its tendency to develop a negative gas balance in the middle ear. Because of this tendency to redevelop negative middle ear pressure, insertion and reinsertion of ventilation tubes are often necessary to prevent recurrent retractions and maintain aeration of the middle ear in posterior tympanotomies and modified radical mastoidectomies. Further, when the mastoid bowl is marsupialized, as in radical and modified radical mastoidectomies, the mastoid bowl is often not self-cleansing, thus periodically requiring the help of the otologist to keep it clean and dry. My study consisted of a long-term follow-up of 368 cholesteatomatous ears, which were operated on according to 6 different surgical modalities, ie, 112 radical mastoidectomies, 88 modified radicals, 72 posterior tympanotomies, 52 atticotomies, 36 deliveries, and 8 obliterations. Of the 368 ears, 11% did not require any postoperative toilet, whereas 89% required revisiting the surgeon periodically on an average of every 5 months, for cleansing of the mastoid cavity or securing the aeration of the middle ear by reinserting a ventilation tube.

T1  - Results of mastoid operations in various chronic ear diseases
AB  - A study of mastoid operations undertaken for various chronic middle ear entities, using closed and open techniques, revealed the following: 1. Marsupialized mastoid balls were found less disappointing than often considered; small cavities were dry in 90 percent and large ones in 70 percent of cases. 2. Residual disease (epidermoid cysts) appeared in 27 percent of the CAT-operated ears and in 13 percent when the open technique was employed. 3. Residual disease appeared twice as often when the primary disease involved the tympanic cavity and in young patients than when the attic and mastoid were exclusively involved or in older patients. 4. Residual disease did show up only in epidermoid ("attic") cholesteatomas, but not when the primary pathology was a retraction pocket (sinus tympani) cholesteatoma. 5. Up to 56 percent of the CAT-operated ears showed small, medium, or large retraction pockets. However, only large retraction pockets were of clinical significance. 6. The posterior wall, when preserved, atrophied to an important degree in about a tenth of the cases. 7. Significant atelectasis appeared in about a third of the ears once the membrana tensa was preserved, that is, in CAT or conservative radical operations. 8. About 10 percent of CAT operations performed in children may lead to an episode of acute mastoiditis.

T1  - Results of preservation of the posterior canal wall in cholesteatoma surgery as related to middle-ear aeration
AB  - The last otological generation witnesses a fierce discussion concerning the treatment of choice of cholesteatomatous ears--closed versus open technique being the issue. The reports of the success and failure of these two opposed techniques varied greatly (McCabe, 1977; Sade, 1982a). It is the purpose of this study to clarify this issue further by reviewing the fate of 100 cholesteatomatous ears treated by the closed technique and followed up for as long as 13 years--a length of follow-up which has not hitherto been reported. We will also try and attempt to correlate the success and failure of this method with the ability of these ears to aerate--a clinical status which may be regarded as indicating the 'Eustachian function' of any particular middle ear in question.

T1  - Endoscopic middle ear and mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To reduce incidence of residual cholesteatoma following ear surgery; and to reduce the need for second look "open" mastoidectomy using endoscopic mastoidotomy. Ten-year retrospective chart review of 249 primary cholesteatoma cases (1994-2004) with a minimum follow-up of two years. The first objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoendoscopy in reducing the incidence of "cholesteatoma remnant" at the time of primary surgery. The second investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoendoscopy in reducing the need to open the mastoid cavities during "second look operations".MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endoscopes were used on all cases as an adjunct to standard microscopic methods. Once all visible cholesteatoma was removed with standard microscopic techniques, endoscopes were utilized in order to identify any "remnants" of cholesteatoma. Endoscopes were also employed during revision second look cases in order to allow the evaluation of intact canal wall mastoid cavities without an open Mastoidectomy approach.RESULTS: Endoscopy at time of primary operations revealed a 22% incidence of hidden cholesteatoma "remnants" despite apparent total microscopic eradication in closed cavity cases, and 10% in open cavity patients. Endoscopic removal of cholesteatoma remnants reduced the long term cholesteatoma "residual" to 9.7% in closed cavity patients. Furthermore, endoscopic surgery significantly reduced the need to open the mastoids during second look operations.CONCLUSION: Otoendoscopy is a very effective adjunctive method in ear surgery. It allows significant reduction in cholesteatoma residual rate in both closed cavity and open cavity cases. Furthermore, the great majority of second look mastoids can be evaluated endoscopically and thus avoid an open revision Mastoidectomy.

T1  - Posterior canal wall atrophy after intact canal wall tympanoplasty
AB  - The present study investigates the occurrence of asymptomatic posterior canal wall breakdowns following intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) with mastoidectomy. Twenty-four ears out of 501 (4.8%) presented with a posterior canal wall atrophy. A partial defect was found in 15 ears (62.5%), while a subtotal or total atrophy occurred in the remaining nine ears (37.5%). Posterior wall atrophy could be considered among ICWT complications during follow-up visits, but, according to our investigation, its incidence remains low.

T1  - Surgery of the 'only hearing ear' with chronic ear disease
AB  - The management of chronic ear disease affecting the only hearing ear is a controversial subject. The relative scarcity of literature on the subject prompted us to prepare a questionnaire which was sent to European and American otologists and to review 19 cases operated at the ENT Clinic of the University of Parma, Italy, and 16 cases operated at The Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, U.S.A. Surgery of cholesteatoma involving the only hearing ear is advised by all the interviewed otologists without exception, even in the presence of a labyrinthine fistula. The cases from the University of Parma were managed as follows: a classic modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 10 cases, a staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty was done in four cases, an open tympanoplasty in three and a radical mastoidectomy in the remaining two cases. The cases from The Baptist Memorial Hospital were managed with an intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) in nine and with an open procedure in seven cases. All the otologists interviewed agreed that surgery of the only hearing ear requires particular attention and experience, and should be performed with extreme care by a very experienced surgeon.

T1  - Management of the labyrinthine fistula in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The presence of a labyrinthine fistula has remained one of the major problems in cholesteatoma surgery. Confronted with this problem, the surgeon may ultimately base his choice of procedure on four basic conditions: the size of the fistula, its location in the ear, the condition of the other ear, and the cochlear function. Our attitude has been changing, and currently we prefer to perform a staged closed tympanoplasty. When a closed technique is performed, we either remove the cholesteatoma matrix and then cover the fistula immediately or we leave the matrix in situ and re-explore the mastoid process 5 or 6 months later. The series consists of 88 cases out of a total of 701 patients with cholesteatoma operated on between January 1971 and June 1982. In 20 patients the matrix was left over the fistula at the first stage. The results suggest that a staged operation, i.e. closed tympanoplasty, is to be preferred even in cases with an extensive labyrinthine fistula.

T1  - The surgical management of childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - The results of treatment of 124 cases of childhood cholesteatoma are reported in the present study and compared with an adult group of patients. Intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in over 90 per cent of cases in children and the procedure was staged in nearly 80 per cent of cases. The children had a 43.8 per cent incidence of residual cholesteatoma and an 8.8 per cent incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in intact canal wall tympanoplasty cases. Intact canal wall tympanoplasty remains the technique of choice in our hands for the treatment of childhood cholesteatoma; pre-planned staging of the operation is mandatory for the detection and elimination of residual cholesteatoma which occurs more frequently in children.

T1  - Prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty
AB  - Recurrent cholesteatoma in a series of 534 staged intact canal wall tympanoplasties performed over a 10-year period has been reviewed for the present study. Overall detected incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma is 5.2% (28 of 534 operated ears). A steady decrease of recurrent cholesteatoma was found, however, in the second period of our surgical experience (1978 to 1982) when prevention techniques were adopted in all operations, resulting in a 1.07% incidence (four of 373 operated ears). Our present policy for prevention of recurrent cholesteatoma in intact canal wall tympanoplasties with mastoidectomy includes the use of plastic sheeting with thick Silastic, the repair of bony sulcus defects with cartilage shavings, staging of the operation with preplanned reexploration of the middle ear and mastoid, and transtympanic ventilation tube insertion in cases of refractory tubal insufficiency.

T1  - Closed versus open technique in the management of labyrinthine fistulae
AB  - A labyrinthine fistula is the most common complication of cholesteatomatous chronic ear disease. Its treatment remains a controversial subject. The present paper reports our approach to the management of this complication. Operations were performed on 1,226 cases of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma between January 1971 and December 1985. A labyrinthine fistula was detected in 158 cases. We favor intact canal wall tympanoplasty even in the presence of medium or large fistulas: in the latter case, the matrix is not removed but is trimmed to cover only the bony defect and it is left in place. Open procedures with the preservation of the matrix over the fistula are done in an only-hearing ear with fistula, in ears with a wide defect of the posterior canal wall, and in ears with multiple labyrinthine fistulas. The management of the matrix over the fistula and the anatomic and functional results following each type of procedure are presented and discussed.

T1  - Residual and recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty
AB  - There are actually two principal approaches to the surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma, a subject very much debated. First, the cholesteatoma can be exteriorized and treated with an open technique (classic or modified radical mastoidectomy, open tympanoplasty); and second, the radical removal of the cholesteatoma is also possible in the majority of cases by closed tympanoplasty. In this article we examine 283 patients (forty-four children and 239 adults) operated on by the closed technique to review and discuss the postsurgical cholesteatoma problem (residual and recurrent). Total incidence of residual cholesteatoma is 13.43 percent. It is higher in children (25 percent) than in adults (11.72 percent) and is more frequently localized in the mesotympanum (47.54 percent) than in the epitympanum (40.98 percent) or in the mastoid (6.56 percent). Recurrent cholesteatoma, with a total incidence of 7.77 percent, is much less frequent when staged tympanoplasty has been performed than when a one-stage operation has been done. No endotemporal or endocranial complications (labyrinthine fistula, facial nerve paralysis) have been noticed in cases of postsurgical cholesteatoma. These data confirm the opinion that staged tympanoplasty with Silastic sheeting and reconstruction of the erosions of the posterior wall is the technique of choice for surgical therapy of middle ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - Long-term results of treatment for children's cholesteatoma
AB  - Fifty-seven of 98 children with cholesteatoma treated between 1976 and 1985 were available for long-term follow-up. The clinical records of the 57 children were analyzed retrospectively. The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of recurrent and/or residual cholesteatoma, postoperative otorrhea, and hearing results between two groups of patients. One group (n = 40) of children was treated with a radical mastoidoepitympanectomy (RMET) and the other group (n = 17) was treated with intact canal wall tympanoplasty/mastoidectomy (ICWT). Residual cholesteatomas were twice as frequent (17% versus 7.5%) in the ICWT group while recurrent disease was the same. There was no difference in postoperative otorrhea between the two patient groups. Hearing results were equally good in the Type III and in the ICWT group with staged TORP. It is concluded that a Type III tympanoplasty is an excellent one-stage method of hearing reconstruction in patients with good eustachian tube function and an intact stapes and that a correctly performed RMET offers a safe trouble free alternative to ICWT. In selected patients with limited disease and a well pneumatized mastoid, ICWT is still used.

T1  - Validating the excision of cholesteatoma
AB  - In lieu of a radical mastoidectomy, 138 patients underwent a closed tympanomastoidectomy with subsequent staged surgical procedures until the excision of cholesteatoma could be validated. All the patients underwent two surgical procedures, 29% underwent three procedures, and 4% underwent four procedures. The surgical findings at the second procedure were: negative, 41.5%; retraction pockets, 7%; squamous pearls, 14%; recurrent cholesteatoma, 12%; and residual cholesteatoma, 25.5%. At each stage the likelihood of finding any form of cholesteatoma lessens. A conversion from a closed to an open mastoidectomy was necessary for 9% of the patients, and 4% were lost to follow-up. The opportunity to adjust the reconstructed ossicular assembly exists at each stage. With the use of semibiologic prostheses (ossicle cup and columella), the hearing results were: first stage, 67% within 20 dB, 84% within 30 dB; second stage, 77% and 90%; third stage, 77% and 96%.

T1  - Otogenic brain abscess: review of 41 cases
AB  - Forty-one patients in whom otogenic brain abscess was diagnosed and has been treated since 1968 are presented. Sixty-five percent of the patients were between 5 and 15 years of age. All patients had chronic otitis media, and 95% had cholesteatoma. Abscess was located in the temporal lobe in 54%, in the cerebellum in 44%, and in both locations in 2% of the cases. Most patients had radical mastoidectomy and evacuation of the abscess through the mastoidectomy (61%). In addition to mastoidectomy, burr hole drainage was used in 20% and craniotomy in 15%. The most common micro-organism involved was Proteus. Overall mortality in this series is 29%, but after 1976, when CT became available for the diagnosis and follow-up, the mortality rate was reduced to 10%.

T1  - Modified Bondy technique
AB  - Bondy operation is a type of modified radical mastoidectomy in which the mastoid cavity is exteriorized without disturbing the intact ossicular chain and pars tensa. It is indicated in cases of epitympanic cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain, normal pars tensa, and good hearing. The advantages of the technique are one-stage surgery with preservation of preoperative hearing levels, which is not possible with any other procedure. This article presents the indications, technique, results, and complications.

AB  - Cysts of the major salivary glands are most frequent in the parotid where they form a small percentage of its benign tumours. They can be congenital or acquired and of parotid or extraparotid origin. Two unusual cysts are reported: a cholesteatoma arising from the ipsilateral mastoid, twenty years after successful radical mastoidectomy, and a deeply located cysts of probably congenital origin. The literature is reviewed and the management discussed. Parotidectomy, often with extensive dissection, remains in general the treatment of choice.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy: present status
AB  - There are many problem areas in tympanoplasty surgery. For the most part the extent of the problems relates directly to how vigorously one pursues a good functional result: the harder the surgeon tries, the more problems he may have. There are also many controversial areas in tympanoplasty, most of which relate to technique. In regard to tympanic membrane grafting and management of the sound pressure transfer mechanism, how well the surgeon performs the operation is far more important than which of the variety of techniques he uses. In relation to obtaining an air-containing mucous membrane-lined middle ear space and the management of the mastoid, there are many philosophical and emotional factors. There are many ways to manage the mastoid in cholesteatoma surgery, all of which can be successful if properly performed. We use all procedures but prefer the intact canal wall technique. The major advantage of the intact canal wall procedure is that the surgeon may avoid a post-operative mastoid cavity. The main disadvantages of this technique are the problems of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma, problems that necessitate a two-stage procedure in the majority of patients.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: management of the labyrinthine fistula--a report of 97 cases
AB  - Preoperative, operative and postoperative findings in 97 cases of labyrinthine fistula are presented. Most of these patients had had symptoms of chronic otitis media for 20 years or more and manifested some degree of sensorineural hearing impairment. Two-thirds had experienced dizziness. The fistula was limited to the lateral semicircular canal in 83 cases and involved the labyrinth more extensively in 14 instances. The intact canal wall technique was used in less than 60% and an open cavity technique in 25% of the cases. Severe or total sensorineural hearing impairment developed postoperatively in 8% of the lateral canal cases and in over half of the extensive fistula cases. Five percent had incapacitating dizziness for up to six months postoperatively. When a labyrinthine fistula is encountered in an only hearing ear we usually recommend a classical modified radical mastoidectomy. In other instances the procedure performed will vary with the status of the opposite ear, the extent of the fistula, the sensorineural function of the involved ear and the size of the mastoid.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: residual and recurrent disease. A review of 1,024 cases
AB  - This is an analysis of 1,024 primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma operated upon during a ten-year period at the Otologic Medical Group, Inc. Our philosophy of management of the mastoid in these cases has been as follows: 1) avoid an open mastoid cavity when possible; 2) perform the operation in two stages if necessary; 3) reexplore the mastoid and middle ear for residual cholesteatoma when indicated. One-third of 380 revised cases had residual cholesteatoma, disease left by the surgeon. In 260 cases in which the surgeon felt it unlikely that there was residual disease he found it in 23%. In 4% this residual cholesteatoma was found in the mastoid. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was higher in children and in planned, as opposed to unplanned, revisions. Residual cholesteatoma was detected in the middle ear more frequently than in the epitympanum, and in the epitympanum more frequently than the mastoid. Indications for, and timing of, the reexploration are discussed. Recurrent cholesteatoma refers to a retraction pocket and must be differentiated from residual cholesteatoma; the causes, prevention and treatment are different. Recurrent cholesteatoma was detected in 5%. The most common complication of the disease was a labyrinthine fistula (10%). Operative facial nerve damage occurred in one case. The most common postoperative complication was graft failure (3%). Intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy should be performed as a two-stage procedure in most cases when used in the treatment of aural cholesteatoma.

T1  - Wheel-shaped cartilage-perichondrium composite graft for the prevention of retraction pocket development
AB  - CONCLUSION: Our technique can decrease the formation of retraction pockets and improve hearing function. The wheel-shaped cartilage-perichondrium composite graft (Wheel CPCG) can be considered a good material for a drum graft, and it is easy to insert a ventilation tube, in case of initial drum retraction.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to introduce the novel surgical technique of a Wheel CPCG with one-stage ossiculoplasty to prevent a retraction pocket and subsequent cholesteatoma after intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 47 patients were reviewed; 43 cases were selected for audiologic testing. The results of operations were evaluated by comparing preoperative and postoperative hearing results and postoperative drum findings.RESULTS: A retraction pocket was observed in three cases (6.7%). Slight protrusion of partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) and lateral healing of drum was observed in one case each, and there were two cases of postoperative infection. The number of cases with an air-bone gap (ABG)<20 dB increased from 9 (23%) cases before operation, to 20 cases (51%) after operation. The ABG average statistically decreased from 30.0 dB to 24.0 dB, and the mean air conduction thresholds decreased from a preoperative level of 47.3 dB to a level of 35.7 dB.

T1  - A comparison of PORP, TORP, and incus homograft for ossicular reconstruction in chronic ear surgery
AB  - This report presents the results of 210 cases over a 10-year period using PORPs, TORPs, and notched incus homografts (NIH), for ossicular reconstruction in chronic ear surgery. There were 192 adults and 18 children. The surgical technique utilized temporalis fascia in an underlay technique with canal skin covering the outer surface of the fascia. Intact canal wall mastoid-tympanoplasty, as a one-stage procedure, was used for most cases. Homograft nasal cartilage was placed between the Plasti-Pore prosthesis and the graft. Notched incus homografts were prepared prior to surgery and stored in 4% formalin. There were 149 mastoid-tympanoplasties and 61 tympanoplasties performed. Revision of our cases was performed in 16.6%. Within 3 months of surgery, 86% of adults, and 44% (8/18) of children had dry, healed ears free of disease. The graft take rate was 96%. In adults, a total of 99 NIH, 50 TORPs, and 43 PORPs were implanted. In adults, the closure of the air-bone gap to 20 dB or less occurred in 58% using TORPs, 67% using PORPs, 76% using NIH-Partial replacement, and 20% using NIH-Total replacement. Excluding the cases that failed for reasons other than conductive hearing loss, the results improved to 69% for TORPs, 77% for PORPs, 77% for NIH-P, and 27% for NIH-T. In adults, the extrusion rate was 5.5% for Plasti-Pore and 3% for NIH. In children, the extrusion rate was 17% for Plasti-Pore prostheses. From this study, it appears that PORPs and TORPs with homograft nasal cartilage are satisfactory prostheses for chronic ear surgery in adults. In children, Plasti-Pore prostheses should be avoided unless the ear is healed, aerated, and stable. NIHs are good prostheses when the stapes is intact, but they are inferior to the TORP when placed on the footplate. Also, the NIH requires preparation prior to surgery and may be difficult to obtain. We plan to continue using PORPs and TORPs in chronic ear surgery until a better technique is found, or the complication rate becomes unacceptable.

T1  - The management of lateral sinus thrombosis
AB  - The standard recommended treatment for lateral sinus thrombosis is intravenous antibiotics. For those that fail, some authors recommend anticoagulant therapy, others internal jugular vein ligation. Despite these recommendations, there is still a significant mortality in all reported large series and the main reason this is that the cause of the failure has not been found or investigated. Over a six-year-period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 36 patients were admitted with lateral sinus thrombosis. The initial treatment consisted of intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The surgery included cortical mastoidectomy for non-cholesteatomatous ears and modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatomatous ears and drainage of the intracranial collection of pus in patients with subdural empyema and brain abscess. There were nine failures (25 per cent) with this treatment regimen. Blood cultures and pus swab of the ears were taken from these patients. The blood cultures were positive in four patients and the organisms isolated included beta-haemolytic Streptococcus sp. in two, Proteus mirabilis and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one each. From the ear swab mixed cultures were found in eight and a single organism in one. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine (100 per cent), Proteus mirabilis in eight (89 per cent) and Enterobacter sp. in two. Both these organisms were resistant to ampicillin and penicillin but were sensitive to amikacin. Amikacin was then added to the treatment regimen and a dramatic response with a fall in the temperature, and improvement in the patients' general condition was noted within 24 hours, in all patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Radical mastoidectomy: its place in otitic intracranial complications
AB  - Standard recommended treatment for patients with intracranial complications from otitis media, has been radical mastoidectomy, whether cholesteatoma is present or not. This was established in the pre-antibiotic era to improve survival. Over a six-year period, from January 1985 to December 1990, 268 patients were admitted with intracranial and extracranial complications of otitis media. The prospective treatment consisted of antibiotics and surgery. Surgery entailed mastoidectomy and drainage of intracranial collections of pus in all patients. However, prospectively in these patients the ear pathology and not the complication dictated the type of mastoidectomy performed. Cortical mastoidectomy was performed in non-cholesteatomatous ears and radical mastoidectomy in cholesteatomatous ears. Recurrence of intracranial complications occurred in only four patients (two per cent), a temporal lobe cerebritis in the non-cholesteatomatous ear group, and, a temporal lobe abscess, posterior fossa abscess and subdural empyema in the cholesteatomatous ear group. The temporal lobe cerebritis settled on intravenous antibiotics whilst the temporal lobe abscess, posterior fossa abscess and subdural empyema required redrainage. In none of these was the ear surgery revised. There were 15 deaths (eight per cent), all occurring in patients with intracranial complications, 12 associated with brain abscess, two with subdural empyema and one with meningitis. Eight were from the non-cholesteatomatous group and seven from the cholesteatomatous group. The mortality was directly related to the patients consciousness level on admission and not to the type of ear pathology. It can therefore be concluded that radical mastoidectomy is unwarranted in the non-cholesteatomatous ear, even with an otogenic intracranial complication.

T1  - Management of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the changing clinical course and trends in management of otogenic lateral sinus thrombosis (OLST), in view of the rarity of the said lesion and antibiotic abuse.METHODS: A retrospective case study was done in 6 patients referred to our tertiary care centre with OLST over a period of three years from May 2007 to May 2010: Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi - a tertiary care university teaching hospital under central government of India. Medical records of all the patients were scrutinized and data pertaining to patient profile, type of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), clinical course with any other complication and management were tabulated. The said data was scientifically analyzed w.r.t. current medical literature on the subject.RESULTS: Clinically, it was observed that all patients had protracted CSOM - attico antral type, with history of rampant misuse of antibiotics. The attack of OLST in each case was triggered off by an acute attack of suppurative otitis media. Moreover, in all the cases OLST was masquerading as an intra-cranial complication, with no specific clinical features thereby causing missed diagnosis initially. All these patients were diagnosed by CT scan, and underwent modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) with needle aspiration of sinus under antibiotic cover. The said treatment protocol resulted in excellent prognosis with no morbidity or mortality whatsoever. Pathologically, cholesteatoma was detected in 5 of the six cases with one case having only granulations.CONCLUSIONS: In this era of antibiotic abuse, the clinical presentation of OLST has altered substantially, and mimics other intra-cranial complication with vague signs and symptoms. There are conflicting views in contemporary medical literature regarding management of OLST. In our experience, MRM with needle aspiration under antibiotic cover is the treatment of choice for all cases of OLST associated with CSOM attico antral disease/cholesteatoma disease.

T1  - Evaluation of Type III Tympanoplasty Using Cartilage Ossiculoplasty in Cholesteatoma Ear Surgery
AB  - This prospective observational study evaluates the role of tympanoplasty type III in cholesteatoma ear disease during same sitting with mastoid surgery using cartilage ossiculoplasty. Forty patients of chronic suppurative otitis media-cholesteatoma disease were recruited in the study. All the patients had extensive cholesteatoma and underwent canal wall down mastoid surgery. Tympanoplasty type III, that is, stapes columella, minor columella, or major columella, was done in each case along with mastoid surgery depending upon the remnant ossicular status. Conchal cartilage graft was used for ossiculoplasty along with temporalis fascia graft. Hearing and graft uptake results were evaluated at the end of 6 months postoperatively. Of the 40 cases, 3 cases failed tympanoplasty. In the remaining 37 cases, a statistically significant hearing improvement (air-bone gap of 33 dB) was observed postoperatively. Seven cases underwent stapes columella, 13 cases underwent minor columella, and 17 cases underwent major columella tympanoplasty type III. Although a hearing improvement was recorded in all these subgroups, a statistically significant hearing gain was present only in tympanoplasty type III minor columella cases thereby underlying the importance of intact stapes. However, it is difficult to discern the type of tympanoplasty type III that the patient would undergo prior to the ear surgery.

T1  - Small cavity mastoidectomy
AB  - Disappointment with the long-term results of closed operations for ears with extensive cholesteatoma has led to a renewed preference for open techniques. Although the technical advantages provided by magnification and hypotensive anaesthesia have reduced the numbers of unstable post-operative open mastoidectomy cavities, when large, they are still frequently troublesome. Frequently, surgical cavities have been much larger than necessary because of adherence to a traditional approach to the pathologic lesion from its posterior aspect, and the inevitable removal of much normal bone. It is proposed herein that if, instead, bone removal were commenced from the area proximate to the origin of the disease and extended only as far as necessary in order to achieve adequate and effective exteriorization of the disease, fewer large cavities would result and the proportion of stable post-operative ears would be increased. To test this, 100 patients have been treated by atticoantrotomy in which bone lateral to the cholesteatoma sac was removed from anterior to posterior. The 5-year status of the first 43 patients thus treated supports the view that atticoantrotomy provides a logical, safe and successful means of treating extensive cholesteatoma.

T1  - A Novel Surgery Classification for Endoscopic Approaches to Middle Ear Cholesteatoma
AB  - This study aimed to develop a novel surgery classification for an endoscopic approach to middle ear cholesteatoma. We retrospectively analyzed the surgical approaches and outcomes of patients with middle ear cholesteatoma. Middle ear cholesteatoma surgeries were divided into four types and two special types as follows: type I, attic retraction pocket, which only requires tympanostomy tube placement or retraction pocket resection and cartilage reconstruction; type II, cholesteatoma which is limited to the attic or in which endoscopy can confirm complete removal of mastoid cholesteatoma lesions, including type II a, requiring only use of a curette, and type II b, requiring use of an electric drill or chisel; type III, cholesteatoma not limited to the attic, in which endoscopy cannot confirm complete removal of mastoid cholesteatoma lesions, requiring the combined use of endoscope and microscope to perform endoscopic tympanoplasty and "Canal Wall Up" mastoidectomy; type IV, extensive involvement of mastoid cavity cholesteatoma lesions and/or cases with a potential risk of complications, removal of which can only be performed under a microscope for "Canal Wall Down" mastoidectomy. In addition, there were two special types: "difficult external auditory canal" and congenital cholesteatoma in children. In our system, type I and type II middle ear cholesteatoma surgery was completely performed under an endoscope alone. However, estimating the extent of the lesions, determining the choice of mastoid opening and reestablishing ventilation are the key points for an endoscopic approach to middle ear cholesteatoma. The classification of endoscopic middle ear cholesteatoma surgery may benefit the selection of surgical indications.

T1  - Soft-wall reconstruction of posterior canal wall for surgery of noninflamed ears: a preliminary report
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test whether the posterior external auditory canal (EAC) wall reconstructed only by soft tissues retracts after surgery in the noninflamed ear.STUDY DESIGN: The condition of the posterior EAC wall was observed for more than 1 year after surgery in 20 noninflamed ears in which only the posterior EAC wall skin was preserved or in which the wall was reconstructed only by soft tissue during surgery.PATIENTS: Eighteen patients (20 ears) underwent ear surgery for conditions other than otitis media, including ossiculoplasty in 12 ears, cochlear implant in 3, resection of congenital cholesteatoma in 4, and resection of glomus tympanicum tumor in 1.RESULTS: Retraction of the soft posterior EAC wall was observed in only 1 of the 20 ears. In this ear, the posterior EAC wall showed only a slight retraction without any serious problems. Computed tomography revealed that mastoid aeration recovered in all 20 ears.CONCLUSIONS: In noninflamed ears, surgeons can remove the bony posterior EAC wall if necessary, and may not need to reinforce or reconstruct the wall with hard tissue. This enables surgeons to spare time and energy and obtain the same advantages as in the intact-canal-wall technique or canal wall reconstruction by a hard material.

T1  - An assessment of the value of the preoperative computed tomography scans prior to otoendoscopic 'second look' in intact canal wall mastoid surgery
AB  - 'Second look' surgery following primary intact canal wall mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma is considered mandatory for most cases in modern otological practice. The morbidity of the second look can be reduced by the use of the rigid otoendoscope. Forty-three patients undergoing 'second look' surgery were studied with an average age of 24.7 years. Prior to surgery a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed to assess the anatomy and pneumatisation of the cavity. The mean interval between primary and secondary surgery was 16 months and in all cases CT scans were performed within 6 months of 'second look' surgery. The presence of an opaque mastoid did not correlate with residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. The sensitivity of CT in diagnosing residual or recurrent cholesteatoma was 42.9% with a specificity of 48.3% and a predictive value of 28.6%. These results are explained by the fact that it is radiologically impossible to differentiate between recurrence, scar tissue or fluid with a CT scan. Nevertheless it was possible to inspect the cavity with the otoendoscope even in the presence of an opaque mastoid whether due to scar tissue or residual/recurrent cholesteatoma.

T1  - Computed tomographic evaluation of middle ear aeration following intact canal wall tympanoplasty
AB  - The condition of the mastoidectomy cavity following intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) is always of great interest to the otosurgeon. We evaluated the status of postoperative aeration in a stable ear following ICWT for various types of chronic otitis media using high-resolution computed tomography (CT). The mastoidectomy cavity in all the cases of simple suppurative otitis is totally aerated and that in over 60% of the cases of adhesive otitis, attic type cholesteatoma and adhesive type cholesteatoma is obliterated by a soft tissue density mass. The size of aerated spaces in the postoperative middle ear cavity not only depends on the type of chronic otitis media but also tends to correlate with the degree of mastoid pneumatization in the opposite ear. CT is useful for the postoperative assessment of middle ear aeration.

T1  - Treatment of labyrinthine fistulae by a closed technique
AB  - A fistula on the lateral semicircular canal was found in 14 (4.8%) ears with cholesteatoma. In 11 patients with preserved inner-ear function the cholesteatoma membrane was removed, the fistula was solidly closed with fascia, bone, and again fascia. The cavity was obliterated, the meatal wall reconstructed, and tympanoplasty performed in the same stage. Ten patients obtained a hearing gain, an average of 16.8 dB, while one developed anacusis. The results show that the cholesteatoma matrix can be removed from most fistulae. In the case of large fistulae, in which the cholesteatoma matrix is adhering to or invading the fistula, there is a great risk of perceptive hearing loss. By closing the fistula with fascia and bone and using a closed technique a lasting hearing gain may be achieved.

T1  - Tympanosclerosis involving the ossicular chain: mobility of the stapes in association with hearing results
AB  - CONCLUSION: The preoperative bone conduction level provides not only prognostic information but also information on the mobility of the stapes in tympanosclerosis. The surgical results depend upon the stapes mobility.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate operative findings and hearing results of tympanosclerosis involving the ossicular chain, in order to understand the pathophysiology and to establish better surgical treatment of tympanosclerosis.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1998 and March 2004, 29 patients (29 ears) with tympanosclerosis involving the ossicular chain underwent tympanoplasty at our hospital. Patients with myringosclerosis only, or with an associated cholesteatoma, were excluded from this study. The clinical and operational records and pre- and postoperative pure tone audiograms were reviewed retrospectively.RESULTS: Intact canal wall tympanoplasty was applied to all 29 patients. A non-staged operation was performed on 21 patients, and a staged operation was performed on the remaining 8 patients. In 25 patients (86.2%), the sclerotic lesion of the ossicles was located in the epitympanum. In the remaining four, the sclerotic lamella coated only the ossicular chain. On average, the preoperative air conduction hearing level of 57.9 dB was significantly improved to 46.3 dB after tympanoplasty. The success rate of middle ear surgery was 65.5% (19 of 29 patients), according to the criteria of the Otological Society of Japan. In 16 patients (55.2%), the mobility of the stapes was preserved (group A), while in the remaining 13 patients (44.8%), the stapes was fixed (group B). The mean preoperative bone conduction of 25.5 dB in group A was significantly better than that of 37.2 dB in group B. The hearing result significantly improved in group A but not in group B. The success rates were 75% (12 of 16 patients) in group A and 53.8% (7 of 13 patients) in group B.

T1  - The Z-meatoplasty for modified radical mastoidectomy in children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of the Z-meatoplasty technique for enlargement of the external auditory meatus of children undergoing modified radical mastoidectomy.DESIGN: Case series.SETTING: Pediatric otolaryngology practice in an academic setting.PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of children (< or =18 years old) who had undergone modified radical mastoidectomy performed by the author from 1995 to 2005.INTERVENTION: Z-meatoplasty technique used as part of modified radical mastoidectomy.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Development of postoperative stenosis of the external auditory meatus that required additional surgery.RESULTS: A total of 28 children and 29 ears were treated with modified radical mastoidectomy during the study period. The Z-meatoplasty was used in 24 ears, and 3 (12.5%) required revision meatoplasty for meatal stenosis. Twenty-one ears (87.5%) treated with Z-meatoplasty had excellent healing and cosmesis without stenosis, during a mean follow-up period of 40 months.CONCLUSION: The Z-meatoplasty is an effective technique for use during modified radical mastoidectomy to treat children with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Iatrogenic epidermal inclusion cyst of the parapharyngeal space: unusual complication of ear surgery
AB  - A 46-year-old man presented with a 12-month history of a slow-growing mass at the right anterior temporal and superior parotid region. He had a history of chronic otitis media and had undergone a modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma 5 years earlier. Physical examination revealed a sinus tract and diffuse soft tissue mass measuring 4 cm in diameter spread throughout the region of the right anterior temporal and superior parotid areas. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed three separate masses, including contrast material in the right superior parotid region and lateral skull base. The patient underwent a preauricular infratemporal approach. Six months later, a sinus tract recurred at the inferior border of the right zygomatic arch. MRI showed multiple masses in the right prestyloid parapharyngeal space, which were resected through a transparotid approach. The histopathologic diagnosis was an epidermal inclusion cyst (EIC). One year after the operation the patient was in good health and there was no sign of disease. EICs are rare tumors that are seen when epidermal elements are included in the dermis, which can follow trauma. EICs are unusual in the parapharyngeal space. Thus, until they become clinically observable, primary benign growths may not be recognized in this region. EICs must be considered in the differential diagnosis of growths in the parapharyngeal space, particularly among patients with a prior history of tympanomastoid surgery on the tumor side.

T1  - Findings in surgery for chronic otitis media. A retrospective data-analysis of 2225 cases followed for 2 years
AB  - Data on middle ear disease and follow-up was recorded and analysed in 2225 ears operated on for chronic otitis media between 1958 and 1975. The closure rate of tympanic membrane perforations (70-80%) was not influenced by the presence of otorrhoea, but it was significantly lower in patients aged below 15 or over 40 yr and especially when tympanic membrane homograft had been used. For all types of tympanoplasty the mean improvement in air-conduction threshold was most marked at the lower frequencies, being some 10 dB in Type I, 15 dB in Type II and 8 dB in Type III and IV and it decreased by some 3 dB per octave. The combination of cholesteatoma and tympanosclerosis appeared to be rare. The post-operative incidence of otorrhoea was 10-15% after modified radical mastoidectomy and 20-25% after radical mastoidectomy.

T1  - The Hong Kong vascularized temporalis fascia flaps for optimal, mastoid cavity reconstruction
AB  - The classical modified radical mastoidectomy offers the advantages of combining the mastoid cavity, the attic and the external canal into one cavity that remains open for inspection. However the ultimate goal to predictably produce well healed, dry and safe mastoid cavities despite receiving much attention has not been fulfilled. By employing basic surgical principles of wide access to facilitate meticulous removal of all cholesteatoma and then eliminating all raw surfaces of the bony cavity with pedicled vascularized deep temporalis fascia, the Hong Kong Flap technique achieves the highest percentage of dry, stable, disease free ears. This living fibrous tissue layer provides the optimal substrate for epithelial resurfacing while separating the mucosa and bone of the middle ear and mastoid from the surface epithelium. Excellent healing even under unfavourable circumstances is ensured by the rich blood supply to the pedicled temporalis fascia flap. Furthermore the technique obviates the need for second look procedures in more than two-thirds of cases as the cavity lining becomes transparent and simple observation is safe. The Hong Kong Flap was used to reconstruct 107 cavities between October 1988 and October 1992. 86 were performed for primary cholesteatoma removal and 21 for revision of discharging cavities. 103 (96%) healed soundly. There were 4 dry perforations. Minor complications occurred in 8 (7%) patients. 84 (78%) required n+o second exploratory operation. This is a straight forward procedure requiring no special technical skills. The concept is rational and provides the ideal management for cholesteatoma by achieving a dry, safe ear with one operation.

T1  - Management of labyrinthine fistulas in cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. In 213 patients with middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma, 18 patients (18 ears-8.5%) presented a labyrinthine fistula. These cases are reviewed in the present paper. Symptoms, audiometry, pre-operative imaging, surgical procedure and results are discussed. In all cases total removal of the pathology was pursued with preservation of cochlear function. A two-stage closed technique was used. During the first stage reconstruction with tympano-ossicular allografts, according to the technique of J. Marquet, was performed. A second look followed one year later. Three ears were deaf pre-operatively. Improvement of bone conduction was observed in more than 50% and hearing preservation in all other cases but one. In one ear total deafness occurred from extensive intralabyrinthine invasion by cholesteatoma, demanding a labyrinthectomy. The hearing was preserved in four cases in which an amputation of a large part of the membranous labyrinth could be observed. Since neither pre-operative clinical examination nor imaging can be relied on to reveal a fistula, the surgeon needs to be prepared for unexpected fistulas. [References: 54]

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The results of surgery in 266 cholesteatomatous ears were analyzed. In most cases the canal down technique was used. The mean follow-up period was 6.0 years. The incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma was 6%, which is significantly lower than the incidence of residual and/or recurrent cholesteatoma following intact canal wall tympanoplasty reported by several other authors. The canal down technique seems to be superior to the canal up technique in the management of large cholesteatomas.

T1  - Quality of life in children with chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To validate a disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument for children with chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma.METHODS: Caregivers of 45 children with chronic suppurative otitis media, who were offered an operation (tympanoplasty or radical mastoidectomy) in a tertiary children's hospital, were administered a 5-item quality of life survey (COM-5) The COM-5, which is a modified version of OM-6, was administered four times: few weeks and few days before operation and six months and one year postoperatively. Psychometric characteristics and more specifically test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to clinical change of the COM-5 score were the main outcome measures.RESULTS: Median COM-5 score was 2.6 (1- to 7-point scale) with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. Test-retest reliability was good (interclass correlation coefficient=0.73) Construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between COM-5 score and global ear-related quality of life (R=-0.485), between physical suffering and ear-related physician visits (R=0.41) and between caregiver concerns vs ear-related physician visits (R=0.44). The mean change in COM-5 score after successful tympanoplasty was 1.1 and correlated well with the change of global ear-related quality of life rating (R=-0.545) as well as with the degree of clinical change reported by the caregiver (R=0.494). The mean standardized response was 1.3 after tympanoplasty indicating the instrument's large responsiveness to clinical change after this procedure, but only 0.7 after radical mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: The COM-5 is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument. Apart from its satisfactory psychometric characteristics, it can be easily administered in caregivers of children who require a tympanoplasty due to chronic suppurative otitis media.

T1  - Some considerations on middle ear cholesteatoma in 'foreign workers'
AB  - UNLABELLED: The treatment of cholesteatoma in patients without a permanent residence or in medically underdeveloped countries presents a serious problem in middle ear surgery. Methods which erradicate disease safely and reduce the risk of recurrence to a minimum are necessary. We differentiate 3 clinical types of cholesteatoma: 1 Retraction of Shrapnell's membrane or in the postero-superior quadrant with very little cholesteatoma lateral to the ossicles. A transcanal technique is used to evert the cholesteatomatous pocket into the meatus intact, followed by reconstruction of the outer attic wall. 2 Circumscribed cholestatoma lateral and often also medial to the ossicles. Combined approach tympanoplasty is used in such cases. 3 Marginal perforations with large cholesteatomas, situated medial to the ossicular chain. For these ears, classical radical mastoidectomy is the method of choice. (Radical mastoidectomy also has to be performed in all cases of type II, where luxation of the matrix in toto has failed.)RESULTS: No recurrence has been detected in cases where follow-up was possible.

T1  - Identification of risk factors for residual cholesteatoma in children and adults: a retrospective study on 110 cases of revision surgery
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Residual disease after cholesteatoma removal is still a challenge for the otorhinolaryngologist. Scheduled "second-look" surgery and, more recently, radiological screenings are used to identify residual cholesteatoma as early as possible. However, these procedures are cost-intensive and are accompanied by discomfort and risks for the patient.OBJECTIVE: To identify anamnestic, clinical, and surgery-related risk factors for residual cholesteatoma.METHODS: The charts of 108 patients, including children as well as adults, having undergone a second-look or revision surgery after initial cholesteatoma removal at a tertiary referral hospital, were analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS: Gender, age, mastoid pneumatization, prior ventilation tube insertion, congenital cholesteatoma, erosion of ossicles, atticotomy, resection of chorda tympani, different reconstruction materials, and postoperative otorrhea did not emerge as statistically significant risk factors for residual disease. However, prior adenoid removal, cholesteatoma growth to the sinus tympani and to the antrum and mastoid, canal-wall-up 2 ways approach, and postoperative retraction and perforation were associated with a statistically higher rate of residual disease. A type A tympanogram as well as canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach for extended epitympanic and for extended epitympanic and mesotympanic cholesteatomas were associated with statistically lower rates of residual disease. A score including the postoperative retraction or perforation of the tympanic membrane, the quality of the postoperative tympanogram and the intraoperative extension of the cholesteatoma to the sinus tympani and/or the antrum was elaborated and proved to be suitable for predicting residual cholesteatoma with acceptable sensitivity and high specificity.CONCLUSION: Cholesteatoma extension to the sinus tympani, antrum and mastoid makes a residual disease more likely. The canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach seems safe with similar rates of residual cholesteatoma and without the known disadvantages of canal-wall-down surgery. The described score can be useful for identifying patients who need a postoperative radiological control and a second-look surgery.

T1  - High resolution CT scanning for detection of cholesteatoma and complications in the postoperative ear
AB  - Otologists who prefer intact canal wall surgery for removal of cholesteatoma recognize a 12.25% return rate. Revisions often indicated to correct hearing loss are frequently negative for recurrent cholesteatoma. To determine the reliabiity of a noninvasive method of diagnosing recurrent disease and possible complications, 40 patients previously operated on for cholesteatoma using the intact canal wall technique were scanned with a General Electric 8800 scanner. Second procedures were performed on 24 patients and findings compared with preoperative film interpretations. Scans correctly predicted no significant masses in 6 patients and cholesteatoma recurrence in 11; the remaining 6 with diffuse soft tissue changes were incorrectly diagnosed. Focal areas of bone erosion were detectable in 3 cases, indicating active or potential complications. Scans were reliable in detecting cholesteatoma depending upon the pathology.

T1  - Massive temporal lobe cholesteatoma
AB  - Introduction. Intracranial extension of cholesteatoma is rare. This may occur de novo or recur some time later either contiguous with or separate to the site of the original cholesteatoma. Presentation of Case. A 63-year-old female presented to a tertiary referral hospital with a fluctuating level of consciousness, fever, headache, and right-sided otorrhoea, progressing over several days. Her past medical history included surgery for right ear cholesteatoma and drainage of intracranial abscess 23 years priorly. There had been no relevant symptoms in the interim until 6 weeks prior to this presentation. Imaging demonstrated a large right temporal lobe mass contiguous with the middle ear and mastoid cavity with features consistent with cholesteatoma. The patient underwent a combined transmastoid/middle fossa approach for removal of the cholesteatoma and repair of the tegmen dehiscence. The patient made an uneventful recovery and remains well over 12 months later. Conclusion . This case presentation details a large intracranial cholesteatoma which had extended through a tegmen tympani dehiscence from recurrent right ear cholesteatoma treated by modified radical mastoidectomy over two decades priorly. There was a completely asymptomatic progression of disease until several weeks prior to this presentation.

T1  - Mastoid cavity obliteration leads to a clinically significant improvement in health-related quality of life
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing mastoid cavity obliteration.METHODS: Patients who had undergone canal wall-down mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media with creation of a persistent mastoid cavity and underwent revision tympanomastoid surgery including mastoid cavity obliteration using autologous material were included. Audiological measurements including air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) pure-tone averages (PTA) and the air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed. Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) pre- and postoperatively.RESULTS: A total of 25 patients (16 females and 9 males; mean age 51.6 years, 14 right and 11 left ears) were included. Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 9.2 months (SD = 6.5) after obliteration of the mastoid cavity. Compared to the preoperative visit, patients showed a significantly reduced AC PTA at the postoperative visit (mean difference: - 4.1; SD = 10.4, p = 0.045). The mean ZCMEI-21 score changed from 31.7 (SD = 14.5) preoperatively to 17.4 (SD = 15.1) postoperatively (mean difference: - 14.3; SD = 19.1; p = 0.0002). The mean ZCMEI-21 score changes were neither correlated to the AC PTA shift (p = 0.60) nor to the ABG shift (p = 0.66).CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study reporting a highly significant and clinically important improvement in HRQoL after mastoid cavity obliteration in a prospective setting. The improvement in HRQoL was not correlated to the hearing improvement. As a clinical implication, we provide evidence for a substantial subjective benefit of the surgical obliteration of a symptomatic mastoid cavity and, therefore, encourage this surgical procedure.

T1  - The evaluation of canal wall up cholesteatoma surgery with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to investigate the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after canal wall up cholesteatoma surgery, using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).METHODS: Data from a consecutive group of 47 adults scheduled for primary cholesteatoma surgery using canal wall up (CWU) with obliteration, from January 2005 to December 2009, were analysed. Information was extracted from a medical database, and complementary data from patient files and audiograms were collected and recorded retrospectively. The GBI questionnaire was used for the assessment of HRQoL after surgery.RESULTS: There was no finding of residual or recurrent cholesteatomas in the study group. Hearing was improved at 1 and 3 years postoperatively. No patient suffered a total hearing loss. The overall GBI scores showed an improved HRQoL after surgery. Twenty-nine (85%) patients benefitted from surgery, 1 (3%) had no change, and 4 (12%) expressed deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma surgery using CWU with obliteration gives an improved HRQoL for the majority of patients. The GBI questionnaire provides complementary information to hearing and healing results after cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric patient
AB  - A review of patients with cholesteatoma at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1981 to 1986 yielded 161 children. Analysis of data from both outpatient and hospital charts revealed a higher incidence of males to females, and the peak incidence of cholesteatoma appeared to be in the 6-10 year age group. Otorrhea was the most common symptom; and on physical examination, the posterior-superior quadrant was most often affected. Both intact canal wall and open cavity procedures were employed depending upon the site and extent of disease. Seventy-six percent of patients underwent an intact canal wall or middle ear procedure initially, with the remainder requiring an open cavity procedure. Recurrent or residual cholesteatoma was found in 32% of 148 patients at the second procedure, and in 7% of 148 patients if a third procedure was necessary. Pre- and post-operative audiometric findings for 91 patients revealed 21% with decreased hearing post-surgically, 50% with no change in hearing and 29% with improved hearing. Post-operative complications were minimal.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with intact canal wall mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: long-term hearing outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To review long-term hearing results after intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for treatment of cholesteatoma and to identify factors associated with improved hearing outcomes.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of all cases of cholesteatoma treated with intact canal wall mastoidectomy at a single institution by the senior author over a period of 9 years, for which at least 2 years of follow-up data exist.METHODS: Patient and disease information was collected retrospectively and analyzed.RESULTS: There were 148 patients with 156 affected ears treated and followed for a median of 5.3 years (interquartile range, 3.6-7.4 years). The majority of the operations (144/156, 92%) were staged. Hearing data were available for 150 ears. The overall postoperative mean air-bone gap was <= 20 dB in 64% of patients. This was maintained long term in most patients, with 59% of patients still with an air-bone gap <= 20 dB at a median follow-up of 5.3 years. The presence of an intact stapes did not affect initial hearing outcomes, but the group with an intact stapes had improved long-term hearing results compared to those without an intact stapes (71% vs. 42% air-bone gap <= 20 dB, P < .001). The presence of a malleus handle also led to superior long-term hearing outcomes (72% vs. 48% air-bone gap <= 20 dB, P = .005).CONCLUSIONS: Long-term hearing results from intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty are excellent, with the majority of patients maintaining a small air-bone gap long term. The presence of a stapes and/or malleus handle confers improved long-term hearing outcomes. Copyright Â© 2013 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

T1  - Surgical treatment of lateral skull base lesions and reconstruction of the skull base: a report of 20 cases
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the surgical treatment and related experience of lateral skull base lesions.METHODS: In a retrospective, clinical data analysis of 20 patients with lateral skull base diseases, 11 cases with temporal bone space-occupying lesions and intracranial invasion were treated by translabyrinthine surgery, mastoid cavity drainage, or transmastoid surgery to remove the lesion; two cases of cholesteatoma with destruction of tympanic cavity and tympanic sinus canopy with intracranial invasion were treated by extended radical mastoidectomy; seven cases with lateral skull base bone destruction with cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea caused by trauma and deformity were treated by translabyrinth and transmastoid repair.RESULTS: Eleven cases with temporal bone space occupying lesions were resected completely and were without recurrence after surgery. Two cases with intracranial infection secondary to cholesteatoma were rapidly relieved of symptoms without recurrence after radical mastoidectomy. The remaining seven cases of CSF otorrhea included two cases of Mondini malformation and five cases of temporal bone fracture. The leak was stemmed in all seven cases after surgery.CONCLUSION: Surgery is the main therapeutic option for the treatment of lateral skull base diseases. The surgical approach and the type of skull base reconstruction should be selected on an individual case-by-case basis.

T1  - Endoscope-assisted second-stage tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - Intact canal wall mastoidectomy techniques for cholesteatoma are often followed by a planned second look for residual disease and possible ossicular reconstruction. Endoscopic techniques may reduce morbidity but introduce new concerns. Twenty-five consecutive second-look procedures were performed from July 1994 to July 1996 utilizing endoscopes in 19 cases and avoiding or terminating their use in the others because of known difficult anatomy, inadequate exposure, or excessive bleeding. Thirteen cases were prospectively explored first through a planned exclusively endoscopic approach and then opened for a conventional second look in comparison. In one of the 13 cases, endoscopy was abandoned. There were no cases in which endoscopy yielded a false-negative result. Endoscopes underestimated the size of recurrence in one case. Our experience, indications, and precautions for endoscope-assisted second-stage tympanomastoidectomy are presented.

T1  - Small cavity mastoidectomy--5 year review
AB  - It has been recognized that the traditional method of open mastoid surgery often produces a larger mastoid cavity than necessary. Small cavity mastoidectomy is advocated to reduce the size of the mastoid cavity by exteriorizing the cholesteatoma from the epitympanum backwards. When this operation is performed in a sclerotic mastoid bone, the resulting cavity is very small. The 5 year review of 39 ears with small cavity mastoidectomy is presented. Not only were the mastoid cavities small, they remained stable and trouble-free. It also enabled the patients to enjoy swimming and minimizing wax accumulation within the cavities. The hearing results after 5 years were comparable to that of the closed technique. Formation of cholesterol granuloma behind the concho-meatal flap was an uncommon complication.

T1  - Repair effect of xenogeneic acellular dermal matrix during external auditory canal reconstruction after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - Background: In some cases, there is insufficient external auditory canal (EAC) skin to cover the reconstructed canal wall after canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy. Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) can help to repair the skin, mucosa and other epidermal tissue defects. Aims: To investigate the repair effect of xenogeneic ADM (xeno-ADM) for EAC skin defects. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who underwent open mastoidectomy combined with canal wall reconstruction and mastoid obliteration in our hospital. The xeno-ADM was used to repair the EAC skin defect. The epithelialization time, dressing change times, complications and hearing improvement post-operation were summarized and analyzed. Results: Reasons for using xeno-ADM included: 11 (39.3%) cases suffered from extensive middle ear cholesteatoma, three (10.7%) cases suffered from advanced EAC cholesteatoma, eight (28.6%) cases to solve the cavity-related problems, and six (21.4%) patients had a narrow EAC. The postoperative epithelialization time was 5.8 +/- 1.6 weeks, and the number of dressing changes was 4.8 +/- 1.6 times. There was no xeno-ADM rejection and related complications, the postoperative hearing improvement was statistically significant (p = .013). Conclusions and Significance: Xeno-ADM could be a safe, effective and simple method for repairing skin defect in the reconstruction of EAC after CWD mastoidectomy.

T1  - Middle-ear cholesteatoma co-existing with labyrinthine fistula and vestibular schwannoma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many conditions, among them vestibular schwannoma and middle ear cholesteatoma with lateral semicircular canal destruction, may be associated with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and vertigo. However, the probability that these two distinct disease entities causing the same symptoms occur in a single patient is very low, approximately 1 per 28 billion per 1 year.METHODS: We present the case of a 40-year-old male admitted to our clinic because of chronic middle ear inflammation with concomitant tinnitus vertigo, and deafness in the right ear. The patient was diagnosed with lateral semicircular canal fistula caused by middle-ear cholesteatoma and concomitant vestibular schwannoma. Canal wall-down surgery was carried out to remove the cholesteatoma, followed by gamma knife radiosurgery for the vestibular schwannoma.RESULTS: Vertigo and tinnitus resolved within 3 days after the ear surgery, and gamma knife treatment resulted in the complete involution of the vestibular schwannoma. The patient presented with completely dry middle-ear cavity and no recurrence of the cholesteatoma was observed during a 3-year follow-up.CONCLUSION: As the hereby reported condition is very rare, the results cannot be compared with any similar report published previously. Nevertheless, based on the outcome, the treatment strategy seems to be both reasonable and effective.

T1  - Outcome of canal wall down mastoidectomy: Experience in Sixty three cases
AB  - A canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) is an effective technique for eradication of advanced chronic otitis media or cholesteatomas. A retrospective study was conducted at a Malaysian Tertiary Medical Center between June 1996 to December 2003 to evaluate the outcome of Modified Radical Mastoidectomy(MRM), a form of CWDM for patients with chronic active otitis media (OM) with cholesteatoma, chronic mastoiditis or chronic active OM with cholesteatoma and mastoiditis. All new cases of MRM which fulfilled the selection criteria were reviewed. The main outcome measures were the hearing outcome and status of dry ear postoperatively. A total of 84 patients had undergone CWDM. However only 63 patients (26 male, 37 female) were included for analysis. The age of the patients ranged between 5 months to 72 years (mean, 31years). The majority of the patients (86%) were adults and 9 (14%) were children. The ossicular chain was eroded in 91% (57 cases). There were 33 patients (53%) who showed no improvement of Air Bone Gap (ABG) closure while 16 patients (25%) had a post-operative improvement. The presence or absence of stapes suprastructure was found to be the major factor in determining the amount of ABG (Chi squared test, P = 0.025 preoperatively and P = 0.031 postoperatively). A dry ear was achieved in 78% of patients with 3% recurrence rate. In conclusion, the study showed that a proper MRM gave high percentage of dry ear and this procedure did not worsen the hearing.

T1  - Can MRI replace a second look operation in cholesteatoma surgery?
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the petrous bones could replace the conventional second look surgical procedure when a canal wall up tympanoplasty procedure has been performed during the first look surgery. Eighteen patients were examined with MRI prior to a second look surgical procedure. MRI was performed on a 1.5 T superconducting system. T2 weighted images before contrast and T1 weighted images after contrast (gadopentate dimeglumine) were obtained. Imaging results were compared with surgical findings. The poor radiosurgical correlation (50%, and 61% after re-evaluation) suggests that, at the present time, MRI is not a valid alternative to a second look surgical intervention in the case of cholesteatoma treated by canal wall up tympanoplasty. In our study, MRI was not capable of differentiating small pearls of residual cholesteatoma from surrounding scar tissue.

AB  - Aim: To assess the frequency of incus bone erosion on mastoid exploration in chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear Cholesteatoma. Study design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Place of study and duration: Department of ENT Al-Hada Armed Forces Hospital, Taif Region, KSA and the Department of ENT Unit, Mayo Hospital Lahore affiliated with King Edward Medical University Lahore from 10th September, 2012 to 9thMarch, 2013 Sample technique: Non-probability purposive sampling. Method(s): A total number of 60 patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media of with middle ear Cholesteatoma were studied prospectively. Surgeries were performed in the operation theater under General Anesthesia on all 60 patients. A standard questionnaire was prepared and the history, examination, laboratory data and treatment were recorded on it for each patient. Result(s): Chronic suppurative otitis media is a common ailment seen in the specialty of ear, nose and throat. Unsafe type of this disease previously known as atticoantral type usually presents with marginal perforation having cholesteatoma which is the hallmark of this affection and also considered as the complication producing element. A total number of sixty patients of chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma were included. Out of which 40(66.7%) were males and 20(33.3%) were females. Male to female ratio was 2:1. The patients shown in table 2 were divided in six age groups. In the first age group, patients aged 1-10 years 7(11.7%), in second age group, patients aged 11-20 years 30(50%), in third age group, patients aged 21-30 years 13(21.7%), in fourth age group, patients aged 31-40 years 3(5%), in fifth age group, patients aged 41-50 years 6(10%) and in the sixth age group, patients aged >50 years 1(1.6%). Mean +/- standard deviation of age group was 21.2+/-11.9 years. The procedure of mastoidectomy was performed in 56 patients (93.3%) and modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 4 patients (6.7%). Incus bone erosion in chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma in 51 patients (85%) and 9 patients (15%) have no incus bone erosion.

T1  - Hearing preservation in patients with labyrinthine fistulae
AB  - Introduction: labyrinthine fistula is the most common complication of chronic middle ear disease with cholesteatoma. We present a series of cases of labyrinthine fistula found during the surgical procedures carried out for cholesteatoma in a district hospital setting, over 11-year period. Material(s) and Method(s): this is retrospective study based on case notes and author's database for the period of 1987 to 1999. During this period 382 operations were performed and 25 (6.54 %) patients found to have labyrinthine fistulae. We looked at the incidence, clinical presentation, surgical technique and hearing outcomes. A standard fistula classification system has been used in order to compare the pre and post-operative hearing. Result(s): records were available in 22 cases, which were 12 men, and 10 women with mean age of 45.2 years at presentation. Only one-third had presented with vertigo. Lateral semicircular canal was the most affected site (95 %). Fistulae classified as types: I= 8 (36.3 %), II-a= 1 (4.5 %), II-b= 5 (22.9 %) and III= 8 (36.3 %). All patients had a standard open technique mastoidectomy. In 5 ears the hearing was lost pre-operatively (1 type II-b and 4 type III fistulae), and in remaining 17 the bone conduction thresholds remained unchanged in 15 (88 per cent) ears. Two dead ears directly related to the surgery and both were of type III fistula. Conclusion(s): one-staged mastoid surgery can be the treatment of choice in these cases. Meticulous surgical technique with adequate sealing of the fistula helps to preserve the hearing. An appropriate classification system is an essential tool in presentation and comparison of results.

The final diagnosis was recurrence in 38 patients and granulation tissue in 18 patients.Results Cholesteatoma detection on diffusion-weighted imaging based on two sets of readings had sensitivity of 94.7 and 94.7 per cent, specificity of 94.4 and 88.9 per cent, and accuracy of 94.6 and 92.8 per cent, with good intra-observer agreement (K = 0.72, p = 0.001). Cholesteatoma detection on delayed contrast magnetic resonance imaging had sensitivity of 81.6 and 78.9 per cent, specificity of 77.8 and 66.7 per cent, and accuracy of 80.4 and 75.0 per cent, with fair intra-observer agreement (K = 0.57, p = 0.001). The mean cholesteatoma diameter on diffusion-weighted imaging was 7.7 +/- 1.8 and 7.9 +/- 1.8 mm, with excellent intra-observer agreement (K = 0.994, p = 0.001).Conclusion Diffusion-weighted imaging is a reliable method for differentiating recurrent cholesteatoma and granulation tissue after intact canal wall mastoidectomy.Â© Copyright JLO (1984) Limited, 2019.

T1  - Open cavity mastoidectomy with primary malleo-stapes rotation: Initial audiological results
AB  - Objectives: Cholesteatoma is a locally destructive three-dimensional epidermal structure. Treatment consists of either excision or exteriorisation of disease. Approaches have traditionally included a modified or radical mastoidectomy, and more recently, combined approach tympanoplasty. The surgical approach used depends on a variety of factors including the reliability of patients to attend follow up. We would like to suggest a third alternative, which consists of an open cavity with a primary malleo- stapedial reconstruction. Method(s): All patients undergoing open cavity mastoidectomy with primary malleo-stapedial ossiculoplasty, from 2008 - 2010 were identified. Case notes were reviewed and demographic, recurrence rate and audiometry recorded. Result(s): Ten patients were identified. The age range was from 16 to 48. There was no evidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma. The mean airbone gap in the operated ear was as follows: 500 Hz - 16 dB, 1000 Hz - 13 dB, 2000 Hz - 9 dB, 4000 Hz - 28.6 dB. Conclusion(s): Whilst most otologists consider that combined approach tympanoplasty remains the gold standard in the management of cholesteatoma, we suggest an open cavity with primary malleo-stapedial reconstruction a viable alternative in selected cases.

T1  - Cholesteatoma and the destruction of middle ear and mastoid cavities in ottorhoea
AB  - Objective: To determine the relative frequency of various parts of temporal bone eroded by cholesteatoma. Place and duration of study: This was a combined study conducted in the ENT Departments of Postgraduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, and Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar. The study took place over a period of 5 years from January1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Sample size: The study included 70 cases of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma. Study design: It was a descriptive study using the non probability convenience sampling technique. Methodology: This was a combined study conducted in the ENT Departments of Postgraduate Medical Institute, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar and Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar from January1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. Informed consent was obtained before including patients in the study. The various parts of temporal bone eroded by cholesteatoma were studied in patients who underwent radical and / or modified radical mastoidectomy for chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma. The frequency of damage to the ossicular chain and other bones was determined. Result(s): A total of 70 cases were included in the study. The ages of the patients ranged from 8 to 48 years. The male to female ratio was 3:1. All the patients had chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma and underwent radical and / or modified radical mastoidectomy. The commonest type of bony erosion was damage to the ossicular chain (92.85%) followed by erosion of the lateral attic wall (54.28%). Conclusion Cholesteatoma has the ability to erode bony structures which may lead to deafness, disability and potentially life threatening intracranial complications. Therefore it is important that the examiner is aware of its possibility in patients presenting with otorrhea, the types of bone damage it may cause and it's potential for producing serious consequences.

T1  - Scutumplasty: Costal cartilage versus bone pate
AB  - This study was carried out to evaluate the anatomical and heating results of the reparation of attic defects in closed tympanoplasty. Reparation was carried out in 194 patients by using a costal cartilage allograft, and in 159 patients with a bone pate autograft. The follow-up was from 1 to 5 years. The study was not truly randomized owing to an occasional lack of allogenic costal cartilage. In the group 'costal cartilage' a partial resorption was observed in 5.7% and a complete resorption in 4.7% of the cases. In the group 'bone pate', partial resorption was observed in 5.5% and total resorption in 2.7% of the patients. Satisfactory heating results were obtained in 86% of the patients of the group 'costal cartilage' and in 82% of the patients of the group 'bone pate'. Both graft materials may be recommended for repairing erosions caused by the cholesteatoma in the wall of the external auditory canal.

T1  - Evaluation of the contralateral ear in patients with chronic otitis media
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the contralateral ear of patients with chronic otitis media (COM) and compare the pathology of the operated ear with the condition of the opposite ear. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients with COM who had undergone tympanoplasty,tympanomastoidectomy,or radical mastoidectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The operated ears were evaluated for preoperative diagnoses,surgery types,the number of surgeries,intraoperative findings (middle ear mucosal conditions,presence of cholesteatoma,ossicular destructions,facial canal dehiscence,lateral semicircular,and dural defects),and postoperative ear conditions. The contralateral ear was classified as intact,or as presence of perforation,retraction,adhesion,and cavity. Result(s): In total,523 patients with a mean age of 31.87 +/- 14.75 years were included in the study. Perforation (30.6%) was the most frequently detected pathology in the contralateral ear. There was no statistically significant association between the number of surgeries,presence of ossicular destruction,facial canal dehiscence,lateral semicircular defect,and dural defect,and contralateral ear condition (p > 0.05). However,there was a significant association between preoperative diagnosis,type of surgery,middle ear mucosal condition,presence of cholesteatoma,and postoperative condition,and contralateral ear condition (p < 0.05). Discussion(s): The perioperative condition of the middle ear should be acknowledged as a risk factor for surgical success in the presence of any abnormalities in the contralateral ear.Copyright Â© 2017,Journal of Clinical and Analytical Medicine.

T1  - The use of vascular flaps in middle ear surgery
AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate improved surgical outcomes from middle and external ear surgery using local vascular flaps to enhance tissue healing. Study Design: The study design was a review of the design and clinical trials of three soft tissue flaps: the middle temporal flap (MTF), the middle temporal canal flap (MTCF), and the wing flap. All derive axial vascular supply from the middle temporal vessels. Setting(s): The study was performed at a single surgeon's private otologic practice. Patient(s): A total of 319 patients were treated from 1991-1996: MTF in 223, MTCF in 38, and wing flap in 58. The average case maturity was 2.25 years. Most cases were mastoidectomy reconstruction or intact canal wall mastoidectomy. Intervention(s): The flaps are used to introduce an improved blood supply to key repair sites in the middle and external ear. Main Outcome Measure(s): Canal skin breakdown, chronic myringitis, and chronic otitis externa were measured. Result(s): Dehiscence rates fell from 15-5% and myringitis rates fell from 15- 4%. Thicker, vascular canal skin was the usual result. Conclusion(s): The flaps provide the optimal method of revascularizing the external canal during mastoidectomy reconstructions and possibly canal defect repairs during intact canal wall mastoidectomy. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of the wing flap and the MTCF.

T1  - Transmastoid approach to otogenic brain abscess: 14 years experience
AB  - Objectives: Objectives of this study were to review our experience in on otogenic brain abscess and its management by transmastoid drainage and compare the results. Material(s) and Method(s): All patients with brain abscess secondary to CSOM presenting to our department from January 1 997 to December 201 0 were included in this study. All patients subjected to clinical, neurological, opthalmological examination and CT scan was done as an imaging modality. All patients managed by radical mastoidectomy or modified radical mastoidectomy and transmastoid drainage of brain abscess as neurosurgical facility not available. Result(s): Seventy-two patients in whom brain abscess secondary to chronic suppurative otitis media was diagnosed and has been treated since 1 997 are presented. 85% of patients were below 20 years of age. More than 50% patients presented with more than one complication of chronic suppurative otitis media. 85% of patients were having extensive cholesteatoma and 1 5% patients were having extensive granulations in middle ear and mastoid air cells. 83% patients were having cerebellar abscess while 1 7% patients were having temporal lobe abscess. 80% of the pus culture was sterile while in 20% patients various microorganisms such as Proteus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp were cultured. Overall mortality in this series was 4.4%. Conclusion(s): In diagnosis of otogenic brain abscess CT scan with constrast is of immense help. Transmastoid drainage of brain abscess is a safe and effective method that can be performed by otologists in cases of otogenic brain abscess.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: revisions and causes of failure. The diagnosis and treatment of the reconstructed ear
AB  - A fascinating new field in the diagnosis and treatment of the previously reconstructed ear is introduced. Discussion of the modified radical type of tympanomastoidectomy is followed by discussion of the posteroanterior tympanomastoidectomy and the causes of postauricular swellings in the closed techniques. This article is intended as an expose of both the compromising and incomplete ear surgery of today, as well as overzealous attempts at reconstruction of the chronically diseased ear.

T1  - The unsafeness of 'safe' ears
AB  - Active chronic otitis media affects 0.5 per cent of adults and has two main variants. The first is when there is a squamous epithelial retraction pocket or cholesteatoma. The second variant is when the disease is primarily of the mucosa of the middle ear and mastoid air-cell system. Classically a cholesteatoma is considered 'unsafe' because of the risk of complications, particularly intracranial infection. Mucosal disease, on the other hand, is considered 'safe' because complications are thought to be rare. Surgery in the form of a modified radical mastoidectomy is considered to make active chronic otitis media 'safe'. A retrospective review of 26 consecutive brain abscesses considered secondary to active chronic otitis media revealed that a cholesteatoma was present in 12 (46 per cent), mucosal disease in 10 (38 per cent) and a modified radical mastoidectomy had been performed in four (15 per cent). Mucosal disease and a modified radical mastoidectomy should no longer be considered 'safe'. However, the risk of developing an intracranial abscess from any type of active chronic otitis media is low, in the region of one in 3,500.

T1  - Classification and surgical treatment of fibroadhesive otitis
AB  - Surgical treatment for fibroadhesive otitis was performed in thirty-seven ears: Eight were classified grade 1, with fibrogranulomatous tissue and mucous effusion; twenty-seven were stage 2, with thick fibrogranulomatous tissue without effusion but with cholesterol granuloma. Fifteen ears had small or middle size cholesteatomas, four had posterior retraction pockets. Results obtained were as follows: One stage procedures were usually functional failures in spite of Silastic sheeting, including one tympanoplasty using closed technique with posterior tympanotomy, three dissections of mesotympanum combined with antroatticotomy, and four obliteration procedures in one stage. Better results were obtained with two stage procedures with Silastic sheeting placed at the first stage and removed at the second. Five closed techniques yielded only one good functional result, but seventeen obliteration procedures with Palva flaps yielded the best results: Healthy and thin mucosa in fifteen cases, with the mucosa remaining thick in only two cases. Good functional results (air-bone gap <= 20 dB) were obtained in ten cases, and among them very good functional results (air-bone gap <= 10 dB) in seven cases. Seven second stages have not yet been done.

T1  - Intact bridge tympanomastoidectomy versus closed procedures
AB  - Intact bridge tympano mastoidemtomy or combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) has been described quite a few years back and recommended by many, but conventional open techniques of mastoidectomy are still quite popular and so the pendulum of surgery swings between these procedures dividing the surgeons loyalty to each one of them. Though it is quite evident that total eradication of the disease making a dry safe ear with tympanoplastic procedures is simple and achievable in open techniques as compared to closed techniques, the results have been gratifying to date in comparison to the classical intact wall tympano mastoidectomy, this one stage operation avoids cost, discomfort of second stage surgery and hearing results have also been comparable if not improved.

T1  - Middle ear cholesteatoma and its complications
AB  - Objective: Cholesteatoma is still one of the most challenging ear diseases, its evolution leading sometimes to serious complications (facial palsy, vestibular disorders, meningitis, intracranial abscesses, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, etc). Surgical treatment is always required to heal the disease. Method(s): We reviewed the surgical reports of 534 patients treated in the ENT Clinic from Cluj between 2003 to 2010. Patients' ages ranged from 3 to 81 years, with a mean age of 30 years. The surgical procedure was to follow the cholesteatoma extension from the tympanic cavity to the mastoid cavity. Result(s): Most of the cases were operated in closed technique. We have used for ossicular reconstruction incus body without osteitis, the head of the malleus, and cortical of temporal bone. For tympanic membrane and canal wall reconstruction we have used perichondrium cartilage with or without perichondrium. Patients with complications underwent open technique. Recurrence of suppuration was noticed in 28% of cases, requiring a second intervention. Hearing improvement was obtained in 58% of patients, satisfactory results were obtained in 19% of patients, and 23% of patients showed no improvement of hearing. Conclusion(s): Autologous materials remain a useful alternative for middle ear reconstruction, improving the hearing in most of the cases. The treatment in cholesteatoma is always surgical, requiring a careful removal of the infection. The surgical technique should be individualized from case to case.

T1  - Cholesteatoma: Long-term follow-up in romanian patients
AB  - Objective: Cholesteatoma is an abnormal destructive growth of squamous epithelium in middle ear and mastoid. The presence of cholesteatoma requires surgical intervention and the main goal is to achieve a safe, dry ear and to improve hearing. The extension of surgery depends on the size of the cholesteatoma. Method(s): A total of 875 patients were treated for cholesteatoma in our department between 2001 and 2010, 213 pediatric patients. We performed both open and closed and technique, depending on disease extension, bone erosion, and complications, followed by second-look surgery in most of the closed-technique cases. Result(s): The closed technique was the treatment of choice in 69.2% cases, most of them uncomplicated cholesteatomas. In 30.6% we performed open technique for different reasons. Second look surgery was done in 57.3% of cases after 1.5 or 2 years. A total of 27.1% of patients were lost to the follow-up program after the first years. Residual cholesteatomas were noticed in 17% of the cases and the recurrent cholesteatomas were operated in 32% of the cases. After surgery the air-bone gape improved in 67.1% of the cases because of tympanoplasty with autologous graft or different types of prosthesis. In some cases we used the BAHA prosthesis. Conclusion(s): Cholesteatoma is a serious condition which needs surgical treatment. Second-look control in closed technique should be done after one-one and a half year. Closed technique is recommended in order to restore the function of the ear which is very important for a proper development and a good quality of life.

T1  - Staging in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The closed technique is the treatment of choice for middle ear cholesteatoma in the opinion of the author. Several interventions may be required. At the onset, the purpose of the systematic second stage procedure was to verify the absence of any residual cholesteatoma. Experience has shown that the interest of this second intervention lies equally in the opportunity to observe the evolution of the otitis disease process, and the tubal status and in the possibility of restoring transmission under optimal conditions, thanks in particular to the utilization of thick silastic sheeting. This technique necessitates, however, a long-term follow-up. On occasion, a third intervention may be required. Despite the iterative nature of this surgery, it should be considered as a form of a logical progression offering the best chances of a successful anatomic and functional outcome for the patient.

T1  - Atticotomy: a neglected otosurgical technique
AB  - Transmeatal atticotomy was a popular surgical procedure during the turn of the century. Due to its limited success it was replaced by the modified radical mastoidectomy. An investigation of the indications, technique and results of transmeatal atticotomy done at the University of Iowa Hospitals was undertaken. A review of 82 patients with a 12 mth or more followup and 61 patients with a 24 mth or more followup was done. An attempt was made to discuss what factors in the history, physical examination, Xray and audiological exam, operative findings and operative techniques influenced the patient's eventual outcome. The criteria for a successful result were considered to be: no drainage from 8 wk postoperatively; no tympanic membrane perforation; no retraction pocket out of sight or touch with a Day hook; and no residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. The transmeatal atticotomy is primarily used in the extirpation of cholesteatoma confined to the epitympanum. It is occasionally used in the mobilization of ossicles with congenital fixation in the attic. At the institution the indications for atticotomy in patients with cholesteatoma are drainage responsive to medical therapy (aural saline irrigations and antibiotic steroid ear drops); absence of bone erosion on otologic or radiologic examination; minimal hearing loss, e.g., an SRT of 40 dB or better; and absence of complication. Of the cases investigated 73.2% had a clean, dry ear without a retraction pocket, perforation or cholesteatoma, at 2 yr postoperative followup. Of the failures there were 12 cholesteatomas and 2 marginal perforations that occurred. There was therefore a 17.1% incidence of failure of atticotomy resulting in a dangerous ear. Of these 5 required modified radical mastoidectomy for eradication of disease. Examination of the history presented by these patients revealed that those who had a history of drainage had less chance of a favorable result than those who did not. Those whose drainage responded to conservative management did better than those who did not. If longer than 4 mth of medical therapy was required before the drainage stopped then the surgical outcome was not as good. The presence or absence of scutum erosion had no significant effect on the results. The degree of hearing loss had little effect on the results. Those who still had suppuration at the time of surgery did less well than those who did not. The patients who had a small amount of scutum excised at surgery did less well than those who had greater attic exposure. Those patients who had recurrent cholesteatoma tended to have less scutum excised, and had their ossicles left intact more often. Transmeatal atticotomy should be limited to those patients with disease confined to the epitympanum. This may be indicated by a history of drainage that responds well to conservative medical therapy and in a patient demonstrating no evidence of bone erosion in the antrum. The operation should include wide exposure of cholesteatomatous disease with removal of the head of the malleus and the incus whenever there is doubt of the extent of the lesion.

T1  - Long-term outcomes of treating middle ear cholesteatoma with intact-canal wall and scute repairing techniques
AB  - Objectives: Assess the long-term outcomes of treating middle ear cholesteatoma with multiple techniques including intact-canal wall and scute repairing techniques. Method(s): One hundred thirteen patients had been treated between 2001 and 2006. Multiple techniques including harvesting bone chips with air drill, sculpting of autologous bone grafts, chorda tympani nerve tightening prosthesis, preventing adhesion with hyaluronic acid ester membrane, lesion cleaning, reconstruction of ear canal wall, re-gasification of attic and/or mastoid cavity, and early catheterization of the Eustachian tube were performed. Result(s): One hundred twelve ears only received the operation once, and the preoperative air bone conduction gap (ABG) was 33.61 +/- 12.35 dB, which was significantly higher than postoperative ABG (13.58 +/- 9.27 Db, t = 18.35, P < .01 [G1]). Success rate of the treatment was 85.48% (106/124), and the effective rate was 47.58% (59/124). Significant improvement in the bone conduction threshold was also found (17.3 +/- 13 vs 15.15 +/- 11.79 dB, t = 4.77, P < .01). Twenty-one ears (16.93%) had increased bone conduction, 61 ears (49.19%) had decreased bone conduction, and the other 42 ears (33.87) had no change in the bone conduction. The longterm success rate was 83.87% (104/124), and the effective rate was 38.7% (48/124). No significant difference was found in the GAP, GAP change, and AC between the values measured at the last follow-up of the long- and short-term follow-up study (P > .05). Conclusion(s): Treating middle ear cholesteatoma with intactcanal wall and scute repairing techniques is safe. These surgical procedures involve low relapse rate, and treating patients with relapsed cholesteatoma with these procedures could also result in good outcomes.

T1  - Acute mastoiditis and its complications. A problem still with us
AB  - Although it is generally accepted that acute mastoiditis is an uncommon disease, there is evidence that it may be on the increase, although serious complications are still relatively frequent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the causes and the clinical course of 24 cases of acute mastoiditis treated over a 10-year period. Eighteen cases were the sequel of acute otitis media, while six cases developed as a complication of cholesteatoma. There were nine cases with intratemporal complications: eight subperiosteal abscesses and one facial nerve paralysis. Two more patients had intracranial complications: a cerebellar abscess and meningitis. Ten patients recovered with conservative therapy consisting of intravenous antimicrobial therapy, combined with myringotomy in some cases. Fourteen patients were treated surgically by cortical (n = 8) or modified radical mastoidectomy (n = 6). All patients recovered following treatment. The paper discusses the different approaches used in the management of this disorder.

T1  - Recurrent and residual cholesteatoma
AB  - Recurrent cholesteatoma can be prevented by sound surgical judgement in evaluating the function of the eustachian tube in intact canal wall procedures. Residual cholesteatoma can, with rare exceptions, be prevented by the accurate dissection of the cholesteatoma from the mastoid and middle ear and by using a flexible surgical approach which can be altered to permit complete removal of the cholesteatoma at the primary operation. Because of the low incidence of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma, we prefer the wide-open modified radical mastoidectomy, which provides the greatest access for the complete removal of the cholesteatoma in a single operation preparatory to the incontinuity reconstruction of the sound conductive mechanism and the new tympanic membrane, all in a single operation (staging is rare). To avoid postablation cholesteatoma, we do not place the obliterative graft over the site of the pre-existing cholesteatoma and favor peripheral ablation of the cavity.

T1  - Language delay by congenital cholesteatoma
AB  - Introduction: The Congenital cholesteatoma results from embryological inclusion of epidermal debris behind the intact tympanic membrane, is rare and usually presents as an otoscopic or surgical findings. They account for about 30% of cholesteatomas of childhood and should be remembered as a cause of recurrent ear infections and language delays. Objective(s): To call attention to differential diagnosis of middle ear cholesteatoma including the impact these diseases can cause. Resumed Report: J.V.R., 2 years and 1 month, male with maternal report of recurrent fetid otorrhea in the left ear and delayed psychosocial development. First episode after 9 months of age, with a mean of 7 episodes a year. Otoemissions absent in neonatal screening of the 1st month, changes in tympanometry and in physiotherapy and speech therapy since the 3rd month. Treated by pediatric for 2 months as gastroesophageal reflux and with different antibiotics by the otolaryngologist without success, suspecting the presence of chronic otitis. The exam showed fetid otorrhea and left ear polyp. Computed tomography showed cholesteatoma. Indicated and performed mastoidectomy classical radical to remove the disease. Conclusion(s): During the infectious processes of the middle ear, the child receives distorted sound stimuli, explaining the phonetic errors. The first years of life are critical to the development of children's language, the hearing loss even no permanent, can lead to cognitive and social backwardness. Proper treatment in the first three years of life is very important because this is the stage for further development of the language.

T1  - Transcanal endoscopic approach for holotympanic cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: This narrated eight minutes video lecture demonstrates the surgical anatomy and the surgical steps involved in eradication of a holotympanic cholesteatoma through an exclusive transcanal endoscopic approach with preservation of the middle ear space and mastoid antrum and avoidance of a radical mastoidectomy. Objective(s): This narrated surgical video illustrates the transcanal endoscopic approach to a holotympanic cholesteatoma with extension in the sinus tympani and Eustachian tube. This video demonstrates the advantages of the endoscopic approach to visualize and gain access to disease in anatomical subsites that traditionally would have required a posterior tympanotomy and a radical mastoidectomy. Method(s): A pre-operative endoscopic exam and a CT scan of the temporal bone were obtained for surgical planning and assessing extension of the cholesteatoma. The surgery was performed under general anesthesia. Rigid 0 and 30 degree endoscopes, 3 mm in diameter and 14 cm in length were used and connected to a three chip video camera and high definition monitor. The surgical procedure was performed working from the images on the monitor. Result(s): The holotympanic cholesteatoma was removed utilizing a transcanal endoscopic approach by direct visualization and removal of the disease from the retrotympanum, epitympanum, periantral mastoid cells and protympanum. Reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and attic defect was performed with a composite tragal cartilage graft. The mastoid antrum was not involved and was preserved intact. Conclusion(s): Endoscopic ear surgery is a valuable surgical technique and offers wide field visualization of the retrotympanic space, attic, periantral mastoid space and protympanum. In this video a transcanal endoscopic approach is utilized to access and remove cholesteatoma involving the sinus tympani and the Eustachian tube with mastoid preservation and avoidance of a radical mastoid cavity.

T1  - Total tympanic membrane reconstruction: AlloDerm versus temporalis fascia
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients who require surgery for chronic otitis media with perforation and cholesteatoma frequently provide no residual tympanic membrane that is usable in grafting procedures. A novel technique of total tympanic membrane reconstruction (TTMR) is described that maximizes perforation closure rate in these situations while minimizing mucosalization, incomplete healing, and anterior blunting. The specific aim of this report is to assess the safety and efficacy of TTMR and to compare the results obtained with AlloDerm compared with temporalis fascia as a grafting material. METHOD(S): The records of 50 patients operated within the years 1999 and the 2004 were reviewed. TTMR with intact canal wall was performed in all cases. Both clinical and audiometric data were analyzed. RESULT(S): Overall perforation closure rate was 92%. There was no statistical significance in closure rate when grafting with AlloDerm versus temporalis fascia. A statistically significant shortened healing time was observed with AlloDerm grafting. CONCLUSION(S): TTMR is a highly effective and safe technique. Copyright Â© 2005 by the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc.

T1  - The radical mastoid operation
AB  - Radical mastoidectomy is one of the basic surgical procedures in otology. The most common indication is cholesteatoma. Other indications include suppurative granulation disease, mastoiditis secondary to malignant external otitis, tumors of the temporal bone, and trauma to the temporal bone. Important operative details include exenterating all accessible mastoid air cells, removing the tip of the mastoid process, exenterating the contents of the middle ear except for the facial nerve and stapes, and contouring the cavity to allow a minimal sized cavity. Meatoplasty is done in all cases and in selected cases the cavity is obliterated with a free fibromuscular graft obtained from the temporal area. Revision rate was 13% and was indicated for recurrent cholesteatoma, active suppurative granulation disease, and mastoid cyst. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 3%. When properly executed, a safe, dry ear resulted in 77% of the cases. When the cavity was obliterated, an excellent result was obtained in 92% of the authors' cases.

T1  - Acute otitis media: The evolution of surgical management
AB  - Objective: Acute suppurative otitis media has been a common disease since time immemorial and, until the late nineteenth century, was followed by a high complication rate, major morbidity, and frequent mortality. Since then, the overall incidence of the disease has changed little; however, in less than a century, progressively more sophisticated surgery and the introduction of antimicrobials have reduced the mortality, at least in developed countries, to a rarity. Complications such as chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane or cholesteatoma, although much less frequent than in the past, are not uncommon. The evolution of mastoid surgery into the antibiotic era is reviewed. Conclusion(s): There is concern that with the increasing frequency of bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the decreasing familiarity of family practitioners with the clinical presentation of complicated otitis media that we may be faced with a resurgence of mastoid disease.

T1  - Evaluation and management of temporal bone arachnoid granulations
AB  - The diagnosis and evaluation of temporal bone arachnoid granulations (AGs) is based on characteristic bone defects in the posterior or middle fossa surfaces of the temporal bone in adult patients with persistent serous otitis media or septic meningitis following acute otitis media. The cerebrospinal communication caused by AGs should be repaired by a middle fossa craniotomy (middle fossa AGs) or an intact canal wall mastoidectomy (posterior fossa AGs) to preserve normal sound transmission. In adult patients with chronic mastoiditis, the dural defect of an AG may permit intracranial extension of the chronic inflammatory process. This rare extension of disease should be considered in patients who have chronic ear inflammation and severe pain or signs of intracranial disease.

T1  - Long-term outcomes for treatment of middle ear cholesteatomas with intact-canal wall and scutum plasty techniques
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess outcomes for treatment of middle ear cholesteatomas using intact-canal wall and scutum plasty techniques. Method(s): A total of 113 patients (124 ears), with posterior canal walls preserved, were included between September 2001 and January 2006. A successful procedure was considered an air-bone gap (ABG) <20 dB or ABG>20 dB + air conduction threshold < 40 dBHL, while an effective result was defined as an ABG<10 dB or ABG>10 dB + decrease >30 dB. Relapse, successful and effective rates, and outcomes during follow-ups were analyzed. Result(s): The mean follow-up duration was 36.58 +/- 20.47 months. Relapse rate was 4.8%, success rate was 85.48%, and effective rate was 47.58%. Twelve patients underwent re-operations. In the six cases of relapse, five ears had hearing loss and one ear had re-perforation of the tympanic membrane. In the 112 patients that underwent a single operation, postoperative ABG was lower than preoperative ABG (13.58 +/- 9.27 vs. 33.61 +/- 12.35 dB, P<0.01). It was also lower in the 12 ears that underwent re-operations (10.38 +/- 8.99 vs. 38.83 +/- 12.43 dB, P<0.001). In teenagers, the success rate was 100% and the postoperative ABG was 8.80 +/- 5.27 dB. After seven years, 11 ears relapsed (13.7%), corresponding to a success rate of 83.87% and an effective result rate of 38.7%. Conclusion(s): Short-and long-term outcomes of intact-canal wall and scutum plasty techniques for middle ear cholesteatomas were effective, with low relapse rates.Copyright Â© 2019, E-Century Publishing Corporation.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery of the middle ear: reflections on recurrences
AB  - The frequency of recurrences (40%-60%) found during follow-up of closed technique for cholesteatoma surgery suggests that this technique should be systematically carried out in two stages. The greater frequency of recurrence in children indicates the necessity for revision surgery when the closed technique has been used. Where for some reason this cannot be undertaken, the open technique should be chosen at the outset. In case of revision, the safety offered by the closed technique is comparable with that obtained by the open technique and the rate of recurrence would be less than 5%.

T1  - Chronic ear disease in children
AB  - Complications of chronic ear disease in children are still prevalent despite early intervention with antibiotics and surgery. The issue of most concern at present is the emergence of penicillin-resistant pneumococci. This paper describes the child prone to otitis, in whom the early identification of the bacterial cause of middle ear infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important. Several methods for closing perforations, including the use of allografts, tragal perichondrium, and formalin-fixed fascia, are discussed. The 'second look' after intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy is reviewed, and an endoscopic approach is noted. Labyrinthine fistulae still occur as a complication of cholesteatoma or granulation inflammation, and a method of correcting them is described.

T1  - Vascularized reconstruction of partial external auditory canal wall defects using the middle temporal artery flap
AB  - To review indications and surgical outcomes for partial canal wall defect reconstruction using the middle temporal artery (MTA) rotational flap. Retrospective review. Academic tertiary referral center. Adults that underwent attempted reconstruction of various partial canal wall defects with the MTA flap by a single surgeon. Review of demographic data, defect etiology and location, operative technique, subject wound healing risk factors, and time/success of canal wall healing. Rate of complete canal wall healing/epithelialization by 8 weeks postoperation. Eighteen cases were reviewed. Underlying canal wall pathology included the following: cholesteatoma, penetrating trauma, malignancy, osteonecrosis, and canal-mastoid fistula. In all cases, the canal wall was completely healed and epithelialized by 8 weeks postoperation, and there were no flap-related complications. Many cases (56%) involved previous intact-canal wall mastoidectomy surgery in the past with apparent degeneration of thinned canal wall bone. In 2 cases, the MTA pedicle had been violated by previous surgery; however, a smaller vascularized flap based on remnant blood supply was successfully used in each instance. The MTA flap is useful as a thin, pliable flap that can be applied for reconstruction of various partial canal wall defects. This technique may be particularly useful in the settings of osteonecrosis and chronic infection where introduction of vascularized canal wall lining is particularly desirable. Although short-term outcomes are encouraging, the long-term outcomes of this technique are unknown.

T1  - Factors influencing the probability of residual cholesteatoma
AB  - Data from the records of 251 consecutive patients with aural cholesteatoma treated surgically by one surgeon (R.E.G.) between 1962 and 1980, using mainly wide access approaches of atticotomy and attico-antrostomy, and assiduously followed up, formed the basis of an analysis to determine what variables influence the change of residual cholesteatoma. There were 42 cases of residual cholesteatoma: 20 in the mesotympanum (including two annular), 17 in the epitympanum, and five in the mastoid. The most important variables for the prognosis of residual disease included age, thye state of the stapes, the state of the middle ear mucosa, and the number of sites in the middle ear cleft affected by cholesteatoma. A logistic model was constructed to describe the dependence of the probability of residual cholesteatoma on the two determining variables age and state of the stapes. The implications of these findings for the surgical management of cholesteatoma are discussed.

T1  - Frequency of ossicles erosion on mastoid exploration in chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Aim: To assess the frequency of ossicles erosion on mastoid exploration in chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma. Study Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was carried out in the ENT Department, Mayo Hospital, Lahore affiliated with King Edward Medical University Lahore. One year study (10th February 2013 to 10th February, 2014). Method(s): 120 patients were admitted through non-probability purposive sampling technique via outpatient and emergency at the Department of ENT, Mayo Hospital, Lahore. Patients were selected after fulfilling the inclusion criteria. All the data was analysed by SPSS version 18. Quantitative data like age was analysed using mean and standard deviation. Qualitative data including gender and presence or absence of ossicular erosion was analysed using percentages and frequencies. Result(s): A total of 120 patients of chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma were included in this study. Out of these 120 patients 80(66.7%) were males and 40(33.3%) were females. Male to female ratio was 2:1. Mean+/-standard deviation of age group was 21.2+/-11.9 years. Radical mastoidectomy was performed in 112 patients (93.3%) and modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 8 patients (6.7%). Ossicles erosion in chronic suppurative otitis media with middle ear cholesteatoma observed in 102 patients (85%) and 18 patients (15%) had no ossicles erosion. Conclusion(s): Cholesteatoma a non-malignant destructive lesion is the commonest finding in operated cases of chronic suppurative otitis media. Most of the studied cases showed ossicles erosion specially incus. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent intracranial and extra cranial complications. Treatment of cholesteatoma is surgery with the primary goal to eradicate disease and provide a safe and dry ear with hearing improvement. Radical mastoidectomy is a procedure of choice for the treatment of extensive cholesteatoma. It was also observed that cholesteatoma is more common in low socio-economic groups.

T1  - Facial nerve paralysis secondary to chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma
AB  - Numerous papers have been written on facial nerve paralysis caused by chronic suppurative otitis media. However the authors found none documenting the results of therapy in a series of patients in whom facial nerve dysfunction was caused by chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. Thus, there is little factual information available to help select a specific therapeutic plan for such cases. Over the past decade, the senior author has managed five cases (6 ears) of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma in which facial paresis (4 ears) or paralysis (2 ears) developed 10 days or less before surgery. The chronic otitis media involved the mastoid and middle ear in five cases; and the mastoid, middle ear, and petrous apex in one case. Modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in four ears, tympanomastoidectomy with facial recess exposure in one ear, and complete mastoidectomy with middle cranial fossa petrous apicectomy in one ear. Five patients had complete recovery of facial nerve function (House grade I), and one patient had 90 percent recovery (House grade II). The results provide support for semi-emergent surgery in the management of chronic suppurative otitis media when facial nerve paralysis supervenes.

T1  - Pediatric ossiculoplasty: Optimizing outcomes
AB  - Purpose of reviewDespite years of research, pediatric ossiculoplasty remains a challenging surgery with numerous variables factoring into successful outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarize recent publications on surgical technique, timing, and reconstruction materials.Recent findingsThe cause behind ossicular discontinuity does not seem to play a role in hearing results after ossiculoplasty; however, revision surgery is associated with worsening outcomes. The status of the ossicles remains an active area of interest, but the data remain mixed in terms of them playing a role in predicting outcomes in adults and pediatric patients. There remains debate regarding the utility of staging the reconstruction and is often undertaken on a case-by-case basis. Other recent publications highlight positive outcomes associated with canal wall-up procedures, titanium prostheses, and partial ossicular reconstruction prostheses. Endoscopic middle ear surgery in ossiculoplasty has been shown to be successful in monitoring and removal of disease and helpful in reconstruction.SummaryPediatric ossiculoplasty remains a challenging yet rewarding procedure. The bulk of publications are retrospective making much of the literature difficult to interpret. There remains a need for prospective and well controlled studies in both adult and pediatric populations.Copyright Â© 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Role of surgical management in temporal bone fibrous dysplasia
AB  - Conclusion: Surgical treatment of fibrous dysplasia of the temporal bone (TBFD) revealed relatively good outcomes. Also, active surgical intervention is necessary to prevent the formation of secondary cholesteatoma or other complications. In particular, FD involving the inner ear may require greater caution when deciding on the resection area and timing of surgery. Objective(s): The purpose of this study was to analyze clinical manifestations of TBFD and its surgical outcomes. Patients and Methods: Nine patients diagnosed with TBFD after surgery at three tertiary referral centers were included. Pre-and postoperative clinical, audiological, and radiological findings were analyzed retrospectively. Result(s): Most patients (88.9%) showed FD involving the mastoid and adjacent area. Radiological patterns consisted of six pagetoid and three sclerotic forms; seven patients were monostotic, whereas two patients were polyostotic. Canalplasty (CP) was performed in six cases and intact canal wall mastoidectomy was performed in three of them; hearing gain was achieved in five and one patient maintained preoperative normal hearing. Two patients underwent revision CP and showed no recurrence. In addition, one case had secondary cholesteatoma formed by an obstruction of the external auditory canal; another with a fast-growing cystic mass in the petrous bone underwent transmastoid labyrinthectomy and had no recurrence for 11 months.

T1  - Five years experience using the intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma: Preliminary report
AB  - Many advances have occurred in the treatment of acute suppurative inflammation of the middle ear; however, the problem of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma still persists today. This paper deals with the author's experience over 5 years using the intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy treatment in chronic otitis media with particular emphasis on the treatment of cholesteatoma both in adults and children. From May 1, 1976 to May 1, 1981, 204 ears were operated on for chronic otitis media with the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy technique. Of this group, 104 ears were operated on using the intact canal wall technique when there was cholesteatoma present. The major emphasis of this paper will be to evaluate those ears with cholesteatoma. The technique of the procedure used and modifications that have been made are outlined with particular reference as to why modifications were made as problems arose while observing this group of patients. The results of this study suggest that there is a greater incidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma using the intact canal wall technique in children than in adults. It is believed that this higher rate is due to ongoing eustachian tube difficulties present in children. It is also felt that the intact canal wall technique does provide a better chance of auditory functional rehabilitation than an open cavity ear procedure. The problem of residual cholesteatoma still exists using the intact canal wall procedure; however, the problem seems to be well taken care of using a planned two-state procedure. This is particularly necessary because two-thirds of all residual cholesteatoma was found to be in the middle ear. The conclusions of the study suggest that a planned two-stage intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy can accomplish the goals of cholesteatoma surgery, i.e., control of the disease and improved functional results. It is felt that, if cholesteatoma recurs in a child, the revision operation should be converted to a properly performed open cavity procedure. It was felt that the anatomic removal of the posterior bony canal wall in an open cavity procedure does not render an ear safe from further problems.

T1  - Surgical techniques and results in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - A review of 349 patients with cholesteatoma operated between 1980 and 1995 was done. Of 349 patients, 272 cases had documented follow-up for 1 year or longer and were included in the study which consists of the incidence of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma. The most appropriate surgical technique was performed for each individual case. The surgical techniques were placed in two groups. Open cavity technique: 120 radical mastoidectomy, 26 modified radical mastoidectomy; closed technique: 113 intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy, 13 planned two stage procedure. Recurrence rates were 7.5% with open technique and 11.1% with closed technique. Residive rates were 9.6% with open technique and 5.5% with closed technique. Total failure rate was 17% with open technique and 16.6% with closed technique. The mean follow-up period was 30 months. In our series, there was no significant difference in the incidence and total failure rate of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma between open cavity and closed cavity techniques (p > 0.05).

T1  - Clinical markers of cholestetoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of clinical markers, predict underlying cholestetoma in chronic suppurative otitis media. STUDY DESIGN: It is cross-sectional descriptive study. PLACE & DURATION: This study conducted at ENT Department Liaquat National Hospital Karachi from June 2003 to July 2005. MATERIAL & METHODS: Patients presented with history of chronic suppurative otitis media with clinical markers, suspicious of underlying cholestetoma irrespective of age and sex were evaluated by detailed history, otolaryngology examination, ear examination under microscope, hearing loss assessment primarily by tuning fork test and pure tone audiometry. All patients were operated for mastoid exploration by cortical mastoidectomy and then subsequently converted into modified or radical mastoidectomy according to nature and extent of disease. Tissue removed sent for histopathology to confirm the diagnosis RESULTS: Out of 100 patients 48 were females and 52 were males. Fifty-six of patients had nonspecific chronic inflammation and 44% had cholestetoma. Highest prevalence of cholestetoma observed in aural polyps (31.81%), followed by 27.27% in chronic discharging ear with central perforation not resolving with medical treatment, and 18.18% of cholestetoma in patients with attic perforation/retraction pocket, 15.90% in Granulation tissue and the lowest percentage of cholestetoma seen in posterior-superior marginal perforation (6.81%). CONCLUSION(S): Chronic suppurative otitis media with clinical markers, suspicious for underlying cholestetoma, not resolving with medical treatment, have significant percentage of presence of underlying Cholestetoma. It is necessary to evaluate every patient of CSOM carefully for early recognition and treatment, to avoid intra and extra cranial complication.

T1  - Can we reduce rates of residual cholesteatoma by improving the clarity of the operative field? A multivariate analysis
AB  - Learning Objectives: 1) to demonstrate the influence of impaired surgical field clarity due to intraoperative bleeding on development of residual cholesteatoma. 2) To emphasize the importance of implementing methods to minimize surgical site bleeding, such as hypotensive general anesthesia. Introduction: Sites within the middle ear and mastoid with limited visualization are more frequently implicated in residual cholesteatoma. We hypothesize that other factors leading to compromised surgical field visualisation may similarly affect rates of residual cholesteatoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether impairment of surgical site visualisation from intra-operative bleeding contributes to the risk of residual cholesteatoma. Method(s): Data were collected prospectively on a consecutive series of children having intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma at an academic pediatric hospital. Clarity of surgical field was assessed intra-operatively on a six-point rating scale and categorized as minimally compromised (grades 0-I) or significantly compromised (grades II-V). Presence of residual cholesteatoma was assessed at follow up clinical encounters, second stage procedures, and with MRI. Result(s): Surgery was completed on 224 ears, during which 82 (37%) had minimal visual field compromise from bleeding. Residual cholesteatoma was identified in 38 (17%) of ears, with only 8 (9.8%) in cases with minimal bleeding at first surgery, and 30 (21%) in cases with significant bleeding. Predictors of residual disease on univariate regression analysis included severity of bleeding (p= 0.029), extent of cholesteatoma (p < 0.001), years of surgeon's experience (p = 0.0045). Age and type of cholesteatoma were not found to be significant. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the most robust predictor was extent of cholesteatoma (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Impairment of surgical field visualization from intraoperative bleeding is one factor that contributes to the presence of residual cholesteatoma. These findings support the use of techniques, such as hypotensive general anesthesia, that minimize surgical site bleeding and improve surgical field visualization.

T1  - Correlation between MRI findings and second look operation in cholesteatoma surgery: Preliminary results
AB  - Purpose: To compare the MRI findings to the surgical findings of second-look procedures for residual cholesteatoma. Material(s) and Method(s): This was a prospective audit of all patients who underwent intact canal-wall tympanomastoidectomy and had a second-look procedure between 6 and 9 months later. The MRI scan was performed within 1 week of the second-look operation. The scans were obtained on a 3-Tesla Philips Healthcare unit with nonecho planar single-shot water-diffusion sequences. Result(s): 8 MRI scans were obtained for 7 patients (5 females). None of the patients required general anaesthetic.One patient had 2 MRI scans and a third-look procedure. True positive (5/ 8,62.5%) and true negative findings (1/8,12.5%) led to a radiosurgical correlation of 75%.There was one false positive which was found to be a small cyst with a keratin pearl(<3 mm) within the mastoid cavity. One MRI was reported as equivocal although no recurrence was found at second-look. Conclusion(s): Less than 3 mm lesions cannot be detected with the present scanning protocol. Movement artifacts can degrade the quality of scans. Despite growing enthusiasm for MRI scanning,it is not accurate enough to replace the need for conventional second-look procedures.

T1  - A new external canal wall-preserving method for aural cholesteatoma surgery - The osteocutaneous flap
AB  - There are three major results of successful aural cholesteatoma surgery. They are called cavity opened, cavity obliterated and cavity closed (Table 1). Cavity opened or cavity closed, call for the use of canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU), respectively. With an obliterated cavity, either the canal wall down or canal wall up method may be used. An intermediate form for management of the canal wall is called temporary CWD and two methods of this form have been used. One is the temporary posterosuperior canal wall resection method and the other is the one the author describes here, the osteocutaneous flap for wall preservation (Fig. 1). The author used this method after deciding to cut down the canal wall in the case of difficult removal of cholesteatoma in the epitympanum or the middle ear recesses under the CWU procedure. In fifteen cases in the past 2 years this method has been used to complete operations which initially began with the CWU procedure. The results included short healing time, less post-operation care, fair hearing recovery and optimal conditions for a smooth and safe 2nd operation. The osteocutaneous flap method gives us one more choice in the many different methods of cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Complications of otitis media requiring surgical intervention
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the incidence of complications of otitis media that require surgical interventions has decreased substantially over the past few years, it is a prevailing condition for which clinicians should remain vigilant. METHOD(S): We conducted a 3-year review (June 1998-June 2001) in our hospital of surgical records of patients with complications of otitis media that were treated surgically. RESULT(S): There were 16 patients with complications of otitis media, of which nine (56%) were intracranial; brain abscess and lateral sinus thrombosis were the most common intracranial complications. Extracranial complications were present in 15 (94%) of the patients; mastoid abscess (40%) was the most common extracranial complication. Seven (44%) patients had two or more concomitant complications. All patients with intracranial complications recovered well with no neurological deficits after aggressive antibiotic therapy and initial surgical treatment by neurosurgeons. Modified radical mastoidectomy was the most common surgical otological procedure that was performed in these cases. CONCLUSION(S): Aggressive antibiotic therapy and combined management of cases by otologists and neurosurgeons are the key to reducing the morbidity and mortality of the serious complications of otitis media.

T1  - Meeting medical expectations in pediatric cholesteatoma surgery-revisited
AB  - Learning Objectives: to establish realistic expectations in pediatric cholesteatoma in the era of non-EPI-diffusion weighted MRI. Introduction: Cholesteatoma is a struggle for a safe and convenient condition with the least possible surgeries in the presence of a disease that tends to re-create after complete removal due to the compromised ME physiology, as well as the possibility of residual disease. Method(s): Data collected from consecutive pediatric cholesteatoma surgeries performed by a single surgeon (ML) between 2001 and 2005 and between 2011 and 2015. Type and number of surgeries performed in each group over the follow up period before (2001 and 2005) and after (2011 and 2015) the introduction of non-EPI-diffusion weighted MRI were compared. Revision surgery was also performed in both groups at any point when recurrent cholesteatoma is detected by routine follow-up otoscopy (4-6 weeks, 3 m, and every 6 m thereafter). Result(s): There were no significant medical or surgical complications in either group. 54.5% of the children operated between 2001-2005 ended with a CWD mastoidectomy condition (radical cavity) after a mean follow up of 5.8 +/- 3.8. None of the children operated during 2011-2015, after the introduction of routine periodic post-operative non-EPI diffusion MRI follow-up ended at this point or expected to have at any point a radical mastoidectomy. Conclusion(s): Currently, radical mastoidectomy with meatoplasty should not be used as one of the routine surgical options in pediatric cholesteatoma. Follow up (clinical and imaging) after cholesteatoma is absolutely mandatory, without it, children with cholesteatoma are exposed to a very significant and unnecessary risk. In cases of repeated, de-novo re-creation of cholesteatoma, or repeated infection in an existing radical cavity, a CWD mastoidectomy with blind sac obliteration of the EEC and the ME cleft is also a very practical option in certain cases, as it eliminates denovo re-creation of cholesteatoma.

T1  - A comparative study of outcome of ossiculoplasty using cartilage graft, bone and different alloplasts in chronic otitis media
AB  - Objective: The objective was to determine which material, among autologous cartilage, autologous incus and partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), gives better postoperative hearing result in ossiculoplasty. Study Design: Nonrandomized prospective cohort (longitudinal study). Setting(s): Tertiary referral center. Material(s) and Method(s): Patients were selected from outpatients department with the clinical diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma or granulation tissue. Patients underwent necessary preoperative investigations including pure tone audiometry (PTA). Total 67 patients were selected for this study, among them 12 patients did not fit the selection criteria and 5 patients lost during follow-up. Hence, total 50 patients were taken in the study group. Intervention(s): Ossiculoplasty with cartilage, incus and PORP after modified radical mastoidectomy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Hearing results were measured by PTA-air bone gap (PTA-ABG) after 6 months of operation. Result(s): Selecting the criteria <20 dB ABG as success when stapes superstructure is present, cartilage has 60% success rate, incus has 73.68%, and PORP has 56.25% success. Extrusion rate of different prosthesis shows, PORP has 25%, cartilage has 20% extrusion. Incus has the lowest (5.26%) extrusion rate. Conclusion(s): Among the ossiculoplasty materials, autologous incus gives best postoperative hearing gain and lowest extrusion rate.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: Actual situation
AB  - Learning Objectives: Cholesteatoma surgery is always in the edge for different decisions but when the disease takes place in children the situation is critical in many instances; preservation of hearing, surgical approach, surgical technique and diagnostic tools. We will be presenting you, based upon our experience, the actual situation that cholesteatoma in children faces regarding diagnosis, surgical approach and results. 68 consecutive cases of cholesteatoma in children have been studied 71% underwent a closed technique and 29% an open thecnique. The most frequent clincal symptom was otorrhea and hearing loss (54%) followed by otorrhea (28%). 50% of the cases had an attical perforation and 26% a posterior marginal perforation. 83% of the cases had an sclerotic or diploic mastoid. The contralateral ear was normal in 70% of the cases. In the cases of cholesteatoma the mucosa was hiperplasic or polipoid in 92%. Cholesteatoma extended to attic in 79%, antrum 58%, posterior recces 38% and to mastoid 23%. The ossicles where damaged in 92% of the cases, being the incus the most frequently involved (70%). Residual or recurrent cholesteatoma appeared in 37% of the cases of closed surgery and 12% of the cases of open surgery. Recurrence of the cholesteatoma took place between 1 and 2 years postsurgery in 75% of the cases. A critical review of the literature is made regarding diagnostic tools, recurrences in relation with open or closed techniques, functional results and a discussion about wether to perform single or second look surgery in closed techniques.

T1  - Computed tomography scans of middle ear versus surgical findings in chronic otitis media
AB  - Objective: We evaluated the data provided by Computed Tomography (CT) scan reports for assessing otologic disease and planning surgery; we also examined their correspondence with surgical findings. Method(s): We retrospectively analyzed preoperative CT reports of 202 patients (57% men, 43% women) aged between 15 and 78 years, suffering from chronic otitis media and underwent radical mastoidectomy (17%), closed (31%) or open (52%) tympanoplasty at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Federico II University in Naples between January 2003 and October 2010. We then compared 'quantity' and 'quality' of informations contained in CT reports with intraoperative findings. Result(s): Radiologic reports show the presence of cholesteatoma in 28% (intraoperatively found in 69%), defining the remaining 72% as inflammatory tissue. In 50% the involvement of middle ear generally refers to tympanic cavity and/or mastoid, without considerations of single subsites. Ossicular chain is described in 77% (73% intraoperatively), but 69% of reports refer to the whole chain, mentioning each ossicle only in 8%. Alterations in tegmen tympani are overestimated (20% versus 10%), as erosion of labyrinthine structures (18% versus 6%). Involvement of facial nerve canal is underestimated (7% versus 26%). Procidentia of sigmoid sinus is described in 2% (10% intraoperatively); jugular bulb, really high in 2%, is never described. Obstruction of eustachian tube is reported in 3% (21% intraoperatively). Conclusion(s): CT is essential to assess chronic otitis media; however insufficient informations should lead to greater cooperation between surgeon and radiologist through more detailed descriptions of the ear to operate or alternative imaging techniques (Magnetic Resonance).

T1  - Endoscopic transcutaneous mastoidoscopy for evaluation of residual epitympanic/mastoid cholesteatoma
AB  - It is generally agreed that patients subjected to an intact canal wall mastoidectomy to excise mastoid/epitympanic cholesteatoma should undergo a 'second-look' operation to rule out residual cholesteatoma. The morbidity of this second operation can be significantly reduced with endoscopic mastoidoscopy, when compared to the traditional postauricular (open) incision approach. Details, benefits, and limitations of endoscopic mastoidoscopy are discussed.

T1  - Improvement of surgical technique of anterior tympanotomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - Technical improvements in anterior tympanotomy with a transmastoid approach in cholesteatoma surgery are reported. Mastoidectomy must be extended to the root of the zygoma and the space anterior to the malleus head must be opened. For this purpose, the visual axis must coincide with the external meatal axis. In this head position, complete removal of the anterior attic bony plate becomes possible only through the transmastoid approach, without touching the ossicular chain. In the case of the pyramidal type bony plate with a normal ossicular chain, the incudo-malleal joint is temporarily subluxated, as this is more convenient for access and removal of pathology than incudostapedial joint subluxation. Our clinical results on postoperative hearing showed no damage to the inner ear by the improved technique.

T1  - Our experience of unsafe ear
AB  - Aim: To evaluate the commonest presentation and intraoperative findings and significant post operative challenges in patients who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy in Melmaruvathur adhiparasakthi Institute of medical sciences and research. Design(s): Retrospective study. Material(s) and Method(s): Fifty six patients who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy for unsafe ear disease were included in this study. The study period was from 2009 to 2012.The commonest presentation was evaluated with the history taken from the patient's records. The intraoperative evaluation of primary pathology and its anatomic extension and ossicular status were identified. Common problems we faced postoperatively were documented. Result(s): Of the 56 patients,thirty eight(68%) were male and eighteen(32%) were female. The age ranged from nine years -fifty years of age. The commonest presentation in this study was foul smelling scanty discharge (75%) and the primary pathology was isolated cholesteatoma (54%). The involvement of mesotympanum, attic, aditus & antrum with primary disease was more than the isolated involvement of attic,aditus and antrum. Stapes erosion was more common than incus erosion in our study. We faced a very rare postoperative complication of delayed facial palsy in one patient who had no facial nerve dehiscence. Conclusion(s): Good attention given to patients with infrequent, minimal ear discharge helps to identify unsafe ear. In unsafe ear, otologists should be well prepared to face the stapes erosion during surgery. Even though rare, otologists should be aware of delayed facial palsy and be cautious about the past history of herpes simplex and varizella infection and consider antiviral prophylaxis before surgery.

T1  - Cholesteatoma from a general practitioner perspective?
AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media with Cholesteatoma is a benign growth of keratinizing squamous cell epithelium involving the middle ear and mastoid air cells. Presentation is often subtle with mild symptoms. The diagnosis can be challenging, easily missed and often impossible for General Practitioners (GPs) potentially leading to serious complications and medico-legal consequences. Aim(s): To evaluate the different stages of this condition from the time of first presentation to the time of definitive diagnosis and provide a template for GPs in order to reduce the incidence of missed suspicion. Method(s): A retrospective assessment of a series of patients who underwent surgical exploration with modified radical mastoidectomy for middle ear cholesteatoma with particular reference to content of GP letters, presenting signs and symptoms, mode of and duration to diagnosis and eventual surgery. Result(s): 50 patients were identified and their results are presented. Conclusion(s): Definitive diagnosis of cholesteatoma is only made by microscopic assessment either in the clinic or during surgery and therefore from a GP point of view, it is a case of missed suspicion not a missed or delay in diagnosis.

T1  - Management of lateral sinus thrombosis: Update and literature review
AB  - The management of four cases of lateral sinus thrombosis (LST) over a four-year period at the Royal Darwin Hospital is presented in this retrospective review. The patients were aboriginal and presented with otalgia, otorrhoea and sepsis. Two cases had an associated complication of an otitic hydrocephalus and a subperiosteal abscess. Cholesteatoma was found in three cases. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the LST in three cases. Three patients were anaemic and thrombocytopenic. All patients had positive blood cultures. The organisms were predominantly mixed anaerobes and Bacteroides species. Three patients were managed surgically as a two-stage procedure. One patient was managed as a single-stage procedure with a modified radical mastoidectomy. Therapeutic anticoagulation was utilized in one case. There were no deaths. The prognosis of LST is good if treatment is instituted early with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics and surgery. The role of clot removal at surgery and the use of anticoagulation are discussed in this paper.

T1  - Bondy's modified radical mastoidectomy revisited
AB  - The original criteria for modifying a radical mastoidectomy were: (1) an intact pars tensa and a defective pars flaccida with cholesteatoma; (2) normal or near normal hearing; and (3) an intact, functional ossicular chain. We propose a fourth criterion: that the cholesteatoma site be delineated lateral to the body of the incus. Control of the disease process is easily assured if the lesion is in that area. Our recommended fourth criterion is based on the results of a five-year study of fifty-two cases that met the original criteria. The cholesteatoma reoccurred in the middle ear in only one case. In six cases, periodic care is necessary because of retraction to the grafted attic area. The procedure and technique used in these patients and the excellent results are discussed in this article.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric age group
AB  - The diagnosis and management of cholesteatoma in children remains controversial. In the past 15 years, the senior author (S.C.P.) has treated 320 patients with cholesteatoma. Patients 18 years and younger composed 40% (125) of the overall group and are the basis for this report. The patient data were compiled using the history, physical examination, audiograms, radiographs, patient questionnaires, surgical findings, and postoperative observations. The surgical treatment selected was determined by the extent of disease, the configuration of the mastoid, and a clinical assessment of eustachian tube function. A middle ear tympanotomy approach was used in 17% of the patients, a canal wall up procedure in 31%, and a canal wall down procedure in 52.3%. The average clinical follow-up was 3.9 years, with the range being from 3 months to 13.5 years. Hearing was maintained or slightly improved in a majority of cases. Residual disease occurred in 8% of patients, and recurrent disease in only 3%.

T1  - Contemporary concept of cholesteatoma surgical treatment
AB  - The aim of this study is to discuss the contemporary concept of cholesteatoma treatment guided by pathophysiology and disease staging. The pathophysiology of cholesteatoma can be divided into congenital, primary acquired, and secondary to inflammatory process or epithelial metaplasia whose evolution may be different. Clinical and image evaluation can nowadays clarify the genesis of the case. The use of endoscopes complementary to micro-otoscopy is an important tool. We believe that computed tomography (CT) is essential as a primary image study, providing information related to extension of the cholesteatoma and the anatomy of the ear to be treated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be important in cases of suspected recurrence or central nervous system (CNS) complication as meningoencephalocele. The image study can also provide what we call disease extension elucidating all the middle ear regions involved by disease. All of this information obtained in the preoperative evaluation will guide the surgeon to tailor the best surgical approach to control pathophysiological factors, eradicate all diseased tissues and cholesteatoma, and facilitate tympanic-ossicular system reparation. The classic dilemma between closed or open technique can be solved just by analyzing the preoperative data. Our routine for preoperative evaluation, including details of the image studies we considered important for our surgical decision, will be discussed. The use of endoscopes to inspect some blind spaces to the microscope gives better results to the diagnosis of remains of matrix, and in several ways this use helps in tissue preservation, especially in hidden or inaccessible spaces of the middle ear and mastoid.

T1  - Treatment of retraction pockets and cholesteatoma
AB  - Clinicians view cholesteatoma as a middle-ear condition, in which stratified squamous epithelium produces non-self cleansing amounts of keratin. This clinical definition includes retraction pockets as well as big, deep-seated epidermoids. The two may have different origins, and they often require different therapeutic approaches. Clearance and control of shallow retraction pockets may be achieved with suction cleaning. Larger or long-standing retraction pockets, if not too deep, may be excised, and the tympanic membrane grafted. Deep-seated cholesteatomas require more elaborate surgery. This is true whether it concerns advanced retraction pockets, or big and deep-seated middle-ear epidermoids. The intact wall technique (CAT), though elegant, ends with about 50 per cent failure rate, irrespective of the surgeon. The failures are due either to retraction pocket formation, with or without posterior wall atrophy, or to the reappearance of epidermoids (the so-called residual disease). Reconstruction of the bony defect in the scutum does not prevent retraction pocket formation. It is obvious that an approach which envisages successful removal of the matrix as bringing about cure of the disease is too simplified. The CAT operation should at best be reserved for ears with extensive mastoid pneumatization and small cholesteatomas. Most ears with cholesteatoma (85 per cent) are, however, poorly pneumatized and they fare best with a small radical conservative (modified) mastoidectomy. The procedure should aim at creating the smallest mastoid cavity possible. Small mastoid cavities, possessing a tympanic membrane, an adequate meatoplasty and no recess behind the facial ridge, will be found to be dry in about 90 per cent of cases. A technique for achieving a minimal mastoid cavity is described.

T1  - Soft posterior canal wall reconstruction with and without anteriorly based musculoperiosteal flap
AB  - This study was designed reevaluate the outcome of soft wall reconstruction technique for CWD mastoidectomy and to test the validity of anteriorly-based musculoperiosteal flap attachment without oblitrating the mastoid cavity for increasing graft viability. Two methods of reconstruction were used. Soft wall reconstruction method as described previously by Smith et al, were performed on 35 patients (A) , and anteriorly - based musculoperiosteal flap was attached to it in 25 patients (B). Post operative condition of meatal wall, graft failure and canal volume in two groups were documented. In 3 years follow up period no retraction pockets were documented and there was slight increase in canal volume measured by the volume of povidone iodine pouring in the canal. 17% of group A and 8% of group B had graft failure. No significant differences was seen (P > 0.05). There was no recurrent cholesteatoma in the patients on clinical examination. Soft-wall reconstruction method is a safe method for eliminating the problem of radicalized mastoid cavity, and the musculoperiosteal flap attachment had no advantage compared with soft-wall reconstruction.

T1  - Evaluation of outcomes of tympanoplasties with and without cortical mastoidectomy
AB  - Context: Even today well-trained and experienced otologists remain divided as to the importance of combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty in the treatment of chronic non-cholesteatomatous otitis media. We performed a comparison of patients with postinfectious simple tympanic membrane perforations treated with tympanoplasty or with tympanoplasty combined with intact canal wall mastoidectomy, in terms of outcome. Aim(s): The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of tympanoplasties with and without cortical mastoidectomy in terms of graft uptake rate and hearing improvement. Settings and Design: A combination of retrospective and prospective cohort study. Material(s) and Method(s): A total of 65 patients undergoing tympanoplasty with or without cortical mastoidectomy were included in the study and were followed up for a period of one year for the graft uptake and hearing improvement. Statistical analysis used: Fisher's exact test and chi square test. Result(s): In our study, there was no significant difference in the graft uptake rate or the hearing improvement in both these groups. Conclusion(s): As per this study, it can be concluded that the addition of cortical mastoidectomy to type I tympanoplasty did not improve the graft uptake rate or the hearing improvement in cases of chronic suppurative otitis media tubotympanic disease.Copyright Â© 2014 Indian Journal of Otology.

T1  - Surgical obliteration of the tympanomastoid compartment and external auditory canal
AB  - The ideal patient for a radical mastoidectomy with total tympanomastoid cavity obliteration is one with chronic granulomatous otomastoiditis without cholesteatoma, profound sensorineural hearing loss, and a normal ear on the opposite side. A meticulous and thorough classical radical mastoidectomy is required. The resultant cavity is eliminated by filling it with pedicled flaps and/or adipose tissue taken from the abdominal wall. Suturing the skin of the anterior and poterior membranous canal walls completes the procedure. Healing is rapid and requires minimal postoperative care. The absence of a cavity eliminates the necessity of additional otologic care. Swimming, diving, and free participation in all other aquatic sports are important additional benefits. This procedure has been performed in 44 patients, 24 by author HFS and 20 by author JRC.

T1  - Recurrent and residual disease in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - This is an analysis of 1024 primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma operated upon during a 10-year period at the Otologic Medical Group, Inc. Our philosophy of management of the mastoid in these cases has been as follows: avoid an open mastoid cavity when possible; perform the operation in 2 stages if necessary; re-explore the mastoid and middle ear for residual cholesteatoma when indicated. One third of 380 revised cases had residual cholesteatoma, disease left by the surgeon. In 260 cases in which the surgeon felt it unlikely that there was residual disease he found it in 23%. In 4% this residual cholesteatoma was found in the mastoid. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was higher in children and in planned, as opposed to unplanned, revision. Residual cholesteatoma was detected in the middle ear more frequently than in the epitympanum, and in the epitympanum more frequently than the mastoid. Indications for, and timing of, the re-exploration are discussed. Recurrent cholesteatoma refers to a retraction pocket and must be differentiated from residual cholesteatoma; the causes, prevention and treatment are different. Recurrent cholesteatoma was detected in 5%. The commonest complication of the disease was a labyrinthine fistula (10%). Operative facial nerve damage occurred in one case. The commonest postoperative complication was graft failure (3%). Intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy should be performed as a 2-stage procedure in most cases when used in the treatment of aural cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery at the Otologic Medical Group: Residual and recurrent disease. A report on 307 revision operations
AB  - This article is based on our reports at the International Cholesteatoma Conference, in Tel Aviv, March 1981. Included are a review of the evolution of the intact canal wall techique at the Otologic medical Group and a detailed review of the findings at planned and unplanned revisions. We are currently using the intact canal wall procedure in 75 percent of our surgical procedures for cholesteatoma and obliteration technique in 20 percent, and leaving the cavity exteriorized in 5 percent. Seventy-five percent of the procedures are staged. Planned revisions were indicated to obtain an ear free of disease and an ear with satisfactory hearing. Residual disease was suspected in half of the revisions but found in only one-fourth. The middle ear was more commonly involved than the epitypanum or mastoid. A satisfactory functional result was obtained in 80 percent. Unplanned revisions were indicated primarily of an unsatisfactory hearing result. Recurrent cholesteatoma was the indication in only fifteen cases. Residual cholesteatoma was uncommon. The key factor in the understanding of the incidence of residual and recurrent disease, and the functional result, is an understanding of the surgeons' philosophy. Surgeons who vigorously pursue a good functional result in all cases face a dilemma, regardless of how they manage the mastoid. The more persistent they are, the more problems they may encounter. A planned two-stage procedure frequently will be necessary to accomplish the dual objectives of tympanoplasty surgery: an ear free of disease and an ear with a good functional result.

T1  - Surgical management of tubo-tympanitis
AB  - An intact canal wall mastoidectomy with facial recess opening was performed on 41 patients (47 ears) with non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media from January 1986 to July 1992. Full information was available in 32 ears (28 patients). All the patients had a minimum of 12 months continuous mucopurulent otorrhoea despite intensive medical therapy. Twenty-five of the patients had undergone previous, unsuccessful, surgical attempts in order to resolve their middle ear infections. Follow-up ranged from one to five years and the results of surgery, with emphasis on eradication of infection and repair of the tympanic membrane defect, were assessed. Successful treatment of otorrhoea and closure of the perforation was achieved in 30 ears. It is concluded that the essentials of surgery for non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media are exenteration of all mastoid cells and a wide facial recess opening in order to ensure aeration of the mastoid cavity.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the normal hearing ear
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in ears with normal or near-normal hearing represents a challenge, in that complete removal of disease may require sacrifice of the ossicular chain. Our aim was to identify the predictive factors and surgical strategies that favor hearing preservation in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. METHOD(S): Fifty-four procedures were performed in 50 patients with cholesteatoma and a preoperative speech reception threshold or pure-tone average (PTA) of less than 25 dB. Complete audiometric data were available in 51 cases. All patients had complete surgical removal of cholesteatoma. Whenever feasible, ossicular reconstruction was performed at the time of the initial surgical procedure. RESULT(S): The median PTA changed by -3 dB, and hearing was preserved to within 10 dB of preoperative level in 72% of patients. An intact ossicular chain was found in 72% of the cases and could often be preserved at surgery. However, similar hearing outcomes resulted after intact versus reconstructed ossicular chains and in open versus closed mastoidectomies. The recidivism rate was 26%, and recidivistic cases had worse hearing outcomes. Congenital cholesteatomas and Prussak space cholesteatomas had better outcomes with respect to hearing preservation and recidivism. CONCLUSION(S): Cholesteatoma in the normal hearing ear should be treated with the same surgical priorities as all other cholesteatomas. Preventing recidivism has a significant effect on hearing preservation, whereas preserving an intact ossicular chain and maintaining an intact canal wall do not.

T1  - TORPs - How have they fared after five years?
AB  - Thanks to increasing self-criticism amongst otologists and meaningful interpretation of long-term data, there have been substantial improvements in the management of most aspects of chronic otitis media during the past decade. The theoretical, and very possible actual, risks of 'once-only' closed operations for extensive cholesteatomatous disease being more widely accepted, many surgeons have adopted a policy of automatic staging or have reverted to modified radical mastoidectomy combined with tympanic reconstruction. Again, the repair of tympanic membrane defects with underlaid connective tissue grafts has proved effective and reliable in the long-term. The results of ossiculoplasty have certainly improved considerably, especially when the malleus-stapes assembly is used to overcome incus defects. For these, both homologous and autologous ossicular bone grafts have provided consistent and functionally useful long-term results. All of this represents a significant material benefit for the majority of patients affected by loss of hearing caused by partial ossicular defects due to chronic otitis media. What of the remainder?

T1  - Principles of cholesteatoma surgery. [German, English]
AB  - As a potentially life-threatening disease, cholesteatoma of the petrous bone generally requires a surgical approach. Surgery aims to produce an ear that is easy to care for and is free of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. Hearing improvement is of secondary importance. Nevertheless the sound conduction system is generally reconstructed as a single-stage procedure. There are various possible methods of dealing with a cholesteatoma: (i) preserving or reconstructing the posterior meatal wall with an aerated mastoid (closed technique) or obliteration of the mastoid completely or partially after removal of the posterior wall (closed technique); and (ii) leaving the cavity open for inspection (open technique). In our opinion any technique where the mastoid is not open for inspection should be called a closed technique. Both techniques have their specific advantages and disadvantages.

T1  - Combined approach tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma: Rates of recurrent and residual disease
AB  - Objectives: The aims of the study were to report the rate of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma following primary combined approach tympanoplasty surgery and report the rate of conversion to a modified radical mastoidectomy. Method(s): A retrospective review of a single surgeon series between 2006 and 2012. Result(s): In total 132 s look operations were undertaken with a mean interval between primary surgery and second look procedures of 6 months. The rate of cholesteatoma at second look surgery was 19.7%, which was split into residual disease (10.6%) and recurrent disease (9.09%). New tympanic membrane defects with cholesteatoma were considered as recurrent disease whereas residual disease, typically cholesteatoma pearls, was judged to be remaining following the initial surgery. The majority of recurrent and residual disease was easily removed at second look (85.6%). Only four cases were converted to a modified radical mastoidectomy (3.03%) and three cases required a third look procedure (2.27%). Conclusion(s): Combined approach tympanoplasty allows for successful treatment of cholesteatoma with rates of recurrent and residual disease comparable to open mastoid surgery. Early timing of second look procedures allows easier removal of any recurrent or residual disease, which lessens the conversion rate to open mastoidectomy.

T1  - Cholesteatoma-the silent killer
AB  - Objective-Cholesteatoma has been discussed in all International and National conferences periodically because it is an enigma. The treatment options keep on changing due to sustained recurrence even after perfect surgery. It is a silent killer and therefore is of utmost importance to diagnose and treat this condition early to reduce the mortality and morbidity. Method-In this study we discuss in detail about the etiopathogenesis and various modalities of treatment of Cholesteatoma with reference to modern surgical management. This study has been done in our hospital for a cross section of patients attending the outpatient department during the period January 2012 to Sep 2013 with evidence of cholesteatoma. Various aspects of the disease including age, socio economic status, clinical presentation, Per Op findings and complications were also analysed. Results-In this study of 30 patients with cholesteatoma all of them underwent surgery-Modified Radical Mastoidectomy with exenteration of all accessible diseased air cells. The disease was common in middle aged females of lower socio economic class. The incidence of complication due to disease was 30% [n=9]. The Post op follow up showed recurrence in only 20% [n=6]. Conclusion-Cholesteatoma is one of the entities in ear which requires immediate attention to prevent devastating complications. In the present era with the advent of higher antibiotics and advanced surgical methods the incidence of complications has drastically come down and the disease is also managed more effectively with least morbidity. This study aims to be a comprehensive one to throw light on the dimension of this disease and its management.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula and tympanoplasty
AB  - Three interdependent problems have to be solved by a surgeon in each case of middle ear cholesteatoma with a fistula of the horizontal canal: whether the matrix can be safely removed from fistula or should be left in place; if the matrix is removed, whether the fistula should be covered or not and, in the positive case, by which kind of graft; and whether closed or open tympanoplasty should be performed. In well selected cases the matrix can be safely removed from the fistula and some technique of closed tympanoplasty used. Suitable for this type of surgery are cases of superficial fistula of the horizontal canal, with preservation of the endosteal membrane, where complete removal of the matrix from the tympanic cavity is possible. Very poor hearing and obvious middle ear infection are apparent contraindications. Furthermore, this type of surgery should not be performed on a better hearing ear. If any difficulty in removal of the matrix from the fistula is encountered, the matrix should be left in place. Fistula cases which do not fulfill these criteria should be treated either by open tympanoplasty or by modified radical mastoidectomy, leaving the matrix on the fistula. A small series of five consecutive fistula cases treated by closed tympanoplasty, using intact wall technique or reconstruction of the bony canal wall, with removal of the matrix from the fistula, leaving it bare, is reported after a follow up of three to six years. The results indicate that, in selected fistula cases, this type of surgery seems to bring favorable late hearing results and to create good conditions for closure of the fistula, apparently not presenting any risk to the inner ear.

T1  - The behaviour of modified radical mastoidectomy cavities following surgery
AB  - Objectives: The debate over combined approach tympanoplasty vesus modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) is as controversial as ever. MRM is championed as a 'definitive' procedure with the aim of surgery being a stable, self-cleaning mastoid. There is little evidence as to the amount and length of follow-up necessary to achieve this outcome. Method(s): A retrospective case note review was performed of sequential modified radical mastoidectomies for cholesteatoma undertaken by the senior author, between the years of 2004 and 2009 in a tertiary referral center, using a standard technique. The number and interval of postoperative visits and interventions required to achieve a stable mastoid cavity were collected (min. 2 years follow-up). Result(s): Seventy-three patients were identified. After a short initial period of debridement, most cavities settled rapidly. Many patients required further clinical intervention after the cavity was stable, even for prolonged periods of time. After a median period of 49.4 months (IQR = 31.9-70.5), 53 (73%) of patients were left with a dry, self-cleaning cavity, 17(23%) required regular review for removal of wax, with three patients lost to follow up. No surgical revisions were necessary in our series. Conclusion(s): Following MRM, most patients achieved a dry, self-cleaning mastoid cavity after a certain period of time with appropriate care. It is important to note that ostensibly stable cavities may require further periods of debridement before settling in a truly stable way. Data discussed in this study will allow the benefits of a 'definitive' procedure to be put in a more holistic context.

T1  - Current aspects of paediatric cholesteatomas. [German, English]
AB  - Cholesteatomas can be subclassified into genuine and acquired forms. Whilst epidermoid formations are the generally accepted cause of genuine cholesteatomas, metaplasia, immigration, proliferation and retraction pocket theories have all been proposed to explain the development of acquired cholesteatomas. Clinically, paediatric cholesteatomas exhibit more extensive and aggressive growth than those arising in adulthood. Molecular biological differences in terms of angiogenesis, cytokine expression and particularly the more marked inflammatory responses of the perimatrix could potentially explain these clinical differences. The surgical therapy of paediatric cholesteatomas should be adapted to the individual pathological findings, although where possible a canal wall up procedure is preferred during initial surgery. The "inside-out" mastoidectomy tracking-technique combines the benefits of a good surgical overview with those of a physiological postoperative auditory canal.

T1  - Epidemiologic profile of patients with chronic ear in otology service medical of otorrinolaringolgy residency at Feira Santana/Ba
AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media (COM) is a process of inflammatory nature of middle ear and mastoid with or without a tympanic membrane perforation and otorrhea, potentially leading to a conductive or mixed hearing loss. It is estimated that over 20 million people worldwide suffer from COM. The COM can be divided into two groups: simple and suppurative. The latter group is subdivided into noncholesteatomatous (COMNC) and cholesteatomatous (CCOM). The "radical mastoidectomy" surgery is indicated for these cases and constitutes in cleaning and clearing of the mastoid and posterior and superior bony wall of the external auditory canal. Methodology: Study was conducted prospectively with patients COMNC, CCOM and underwent surgery in a medical residency in otolaryngology in Feira de SantanaBA during the period between 2008 and 2014. We monitored the patients for 8 months postoperatively. Result(s): The following surgeries were proposed: radical mastoidectomy (MR), tympanomastoidectomy (TM), and tympanoplasty (TP), 304 surgeries being performed. Among these, 152 were TM, TP 64, and 88 MR. There was a predominance of females in all types of surgeries. The improvement in hearing was assessed subjectively with significant hearing improvement. Discussion(s): The data obtained in this study confirm the benefit of surgery in the treatment of chronic otitis media. Conclusion(s): Other studies correlating both subjective and objective improvement of hearing in the evaluation of patients with chronic otitis media undergoing surgery are needed.

T1  - Endoscopy assisted ear surgery for treatment of chronic otitis media
AB  - Objectives: To analyze the results of endoscopy-assisted ear surgery for treatment of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, adhesion, or retraction pockets. Method(s): Fifty-one patients who underwent otoendoscopyassisted intact canal wall tympanomastoid surgery for chronicotitis media with cholesteatoma, adhesion, or retraction pocket from 2006 to 2013 have been included in this study. Eradication of the disease from the middle ear and mastoid air cells was achieved by combination of the otomicroscopic and otoendescopic approaches. Anatomic integrity rates of the tympanic membrane (TM), the mean gains of air-bone gap (ABG) on puretone audiogram, and recurrence were reviewed parameters. Functional evaluation was made in patients with intact TM. Result(s): Of the 51 patients, the ratios of the chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and isolated adhesive otitis or retraction pocket cases were 74.5% (38/51) and 25.5% (13/51), respectively. Ossicular chain reconstruction was made with partial ossicular replacement prosthesis in 27 cases and total ossicular replacement prosthesis in 20, whereas the ossicular chain was intact in 4. Anatomic integrity rates of the TM were 90.2% (46/51). The overall (n = 46) pre-/postoperative mean ABGs were 28.3 +/- 12.26 and 9.18 +/- 5.68 dB (P < .0001), respectively. The cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 10.5% (34/38) for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma cases. However, there was no recurrence or new cholesteatoma formation in isolated retraction pockets or adhesive otitis cases. Conclusion(s): Otoendoscopic eradication of the residual cholesteatoma or epithelial tissue from hidden area after the removal of all visible cholesteatoma by otomicroscope is an alternative surgical approach with acceptable recurrence rate.

T1  - Combined Heermann and Tos (CHAT) technique in cholesteatoma surgery: Surgical technique and preliminary results
AB  - The combined Heermann and Tos (CHAT) technique is the combination of Heermann's 'cartilage palisade tympanoplasty' and Tos's 'modified combined approach tympanoplasty = modified intact canal wall mastoidectomy'. The first author (Cem Uzun) performed the CHAT technique as a one-stage operation in 15 ears of 15 patients with cholesteatoma. Two patients (one with a follow up of less than six months and one who did not show up at the final re-evaluation) were excluded from the study. Median age in the remaining 13 patients was 37 years (range: 14-57 years). Cholesteatoma type was attic, sinus (Tos tensa type 1) and tensa retraction (Tos tensa type 2) in six, five and two ears, respectively. Cholesteatoma stage was Saleh and Mills stage 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in one, three, four, four and one ear, respectively. The eustachian tube was not involved with cholesteatoma in any ear. After drilling of the superoposterior bony annulus, transcanal atticotomy with preservation of thin bridge and cortical mastoidectomy with intact canal wall, the cholesteatoma was removed, and the eardrum and atticotomy were reconstructed with palisades of auricular cartilage. Type I tympanoplasty was performed in two ears, type II in nine ears and type III (stapes absent) in two ears, with either autologous incus (eight cases), cortical bone (two) or auricular cartilage (one). No complication occurred before, during or after surgery. Oto-microscopy and audiometry were done before and at a median of 13 months after surgery (mean 14 months, range 7-30 months). There was no sign of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in any patient during the follow-up period. At the final examination, all ears were dry and had an intact eardrum except one with a small, central hole, which had been seen since the early post-operative period. Clean and stable attic retraction with a wide access was observed in two ears. Post-operative hearing at the final evaluation was better (change > 10 dB) than the pre-operative one in nine ears and did not change in the remaining four. Pre- and post-operative mean hearing values were, pure-tone average 47 and 35 dB (p = 0.01) and air-bone gap 30 and 20 dB (p = 0.02), respectively. With the CHAT technique, cholesteatoma can be completely and safely removed from the middle ear, and a durable and resistant reconstruction of the middle ear with reasonable hearing can be achieved. However, a further study should analyse long-term results of a larger patient group.

T1  - The Hong Kong vascularized temporalis fascia flap for optimal, mastoid cavity reconstruction, LE LAMBEAU D'APONEVROSE TEMPORALE VASCULARISEE DE HONG KONG POUR UNE RECONSTRUCTION OPTIMALE DE LA LOGE MASTOIDIENNE
AB  - The classical modified radical mastoidectomy offers the advantages of combining the mastoid cavity, the attic and the external canal into one cavity that remains open for inspection. However the ultimate goal to predictably produce well healed, dry and safe mastoid cavities despite receiving much attention has not been fulfilled. By employing basic surgical principles of wide access to facilitate meticulous removal of all cholesteatoma and then eliminating all raw surfaces of the bony cavity with pedicled vascularized deep temporalis fascia, the Hong Kong Flap technique achieves the highest percentage of dry, stable, disease free ears. This living fibrous tissue layer provides the optimal substrate for epithelial resurfacing while separating the mucosa and bone of the middle ear and mastoid from the surface epithelium. Excellent healing even under unfavourable circumstances is ensured by the rich blood supply to the pedicled temporalis fascia flap. Furthermore the technique obviates the need for second look procedures in more than two-thirds of cases as the cavity lining becomes transparent and simple observation is safe. The Hong Kong Flap was used to reconstruct 107 cavities between October 1988 and October 1992. 86 were performed for primary cholesteatoma removal and 21 for revision of discharging cavities. 103 (96%) healed soundly. There were 4 dry perforations. Minor complications occurred in 8 (7%) patients. 84 (78%) required n+o second exploratory operation. This is a straight forward procedure requiring no special technical skills. The concept is rational and provides the ideal management for cholesteatoma by achieving a dry, safe ear with one operation.

T1  - Role of malleus relocation technique in the surgery of cholesteatoma
AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study are to outline the value of malleus relocation technique in the intact canal wall surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma and to assess the hearing results, healing, and rate of recidivism. Method(s): Study design: A prospective clinical study. Setting(s): A tertiary referral center. This is a study of 145 patients who underwent malleus relocation in middle ear cholesteatoma cases operated with intact canal wall surgery with intact malleus from October 2008 to July 2013. Malleus relocation with total and partial ossicular bridging was used according to the status of stapes. Autologous bone graft was used in ossiculoplasty. Air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds at frequencies of 500 to 3000 Hz were reviewed pre- and postoperatively using conventional audiometry. Airbone gap and bone-conduction thresholds were measured. Result(s): A postoperative air-bone gap smaller than 20 dB was obtained in 79.3% of cases. There was no significant change in postoperative bone-conduction thresholds. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 23 months (mean, 15 months). Conclusion(s): This study shows that malleus relocation is a safe, effective ossiculoplasty technique that helps in complete cholesteatoma removal, preventing its recurrence, and doing same-stage ossiculoplasty with good hearing results.

T1  - Paediatric congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear
AB  - Objectives: To review the clinical presentation, surgical treatment and outcome of a single surgeon's experience with paediatric congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear. Material(s) and Method(s): Surgical databases were accessed for the period 1994-2003 to identify those children who had a congenital cholesteatoma. Diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. Details of presentation, surgical management, progress and outcomes were extracted and analysed. Result(s): Fifteen congenital cholesteatomas were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 3.8 years. Two were intra-tympanic and 13 were mesotympanic. Of these, 5 were localised to the antero-superior quadrant. Three initial surgical approaches were utilised - endomeatal for intra-tympanic cholesteatomas, endaural superior tympanomeatal flaps if the extent of spread was thought to be limited to the mesotympanum, and post-auricular approach to mastoidotomy if spread was thought to be beyond the mesotympanum. The 2 approached endomeatally were cured. Of 10 approached via endaural tympanotomy, 8 were cured via this approach, 1 recurred and came to modified radical mastoidectomy for cure, and 1 was converted to post-auricular mastoidotomy. Four were approached via post-auricular tympanotomy. One came to intact canal wall mastoidectomy to encompass spread and was cured, and 3 came to modified radical mastoidectomy for cure. Of the series, 4 eventually came to modified radical mastoidectomy for cure (3 as the initial procedure and 1 to salvage recurrence). All children swim unprotected but only 10 of 15 have normal heating in the operated ear. Conclusion(s): Assessment of the extent of spread determines the choice of initial operative approach. Localised, smaller, and intact lesions do better. Thus early diagnosis is likely to result in better outcomes.

T1  - Mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal wall up mastoidectomy for prevention of retraction pocket
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the surgical outcome in patients who have undergone mastoid and epitympanic obliteration technique. Study Design: Retrospective review. Setting(s): Tertiary care referral center. Patient(s): The study group included 151 patients with cholesteatoma who underwent mastoid and epitympanic obliteration technique. This technique was applied to cases who had a strong chance of recurrent retraction pocket and cholesteatoma formation, including those patients with an adhesive drum indicating poor eustachian tube function (n = 52) and patients with a destructive scutum (n = 68). Thirty-one patients had both an adhesive drum and a destructive scutum. Intervention(s): The connection between the mastoid cavity and the middle ear was blocked by obliterating the epitympanum and antrum with bone pate and the remaining mastoid cavity with abdominal fat. Main Outcome Measure(s): The postoperative drum state, the incidence of retraction pocket formation and cholesteatoma recurrence, the surgical complications of obliteration, and the hearing outcome. Result(s): In 114 of 151 patients (75.4%), the middle ear was well healed and well aerated. The retraction pocket formation or cholesteatoma recurrence did not develop in any subject. Postauricular skin depression was the most common complication of this technique (n = 31 [20.5%]). In three patients (2.0%), the bone pate used for obliteration was infected. Of the 56 cases who underwent a staged operation to regain their hearing, 37 resulted in a postoperative air-bone gap less than 20 dB hearing level. Conclusion(s): Mastoid and epitympanic obliteration is an effective option for preventing a retraction pocket and cholesteatoma recurrence in patients with a poorly functioning eustachian tube or a defective scutum, while preserving the same advantage of the canal wall up technique.

T1  - Massive acquired cholesteatoma of the temporal bone
AB  - Nine patients with massive acquired cholesteatoma of the temporal bone were treated by radical mastoidectomy, facial nerve decompression, and excision of the inner ear. The commonest presenting symptoms were otorrhoea and deafness but otalgia, vertigo, external swelling and facial nerve palsies were also seen. Polytomography was helpful in assessing the degree of bone erosion preoperatively. The large cavity present following cholesteatoma excision was partially obliterated by a superiorly based temporalis muscle pedicle which helped to seal the internal auditory meatus and prevented the development of a cerebral hernia. Those patients with preoperative facial nerve palsies showed evidence of nerve degeneration and had incomplete recovery at a one year follow up.

T1  - Management of otitic cholesteatomas
AB  - When otitic cholesteatomas are removed by a surgical method that preserves or reconstructs the bony canal wall and tympanic membranes, there is a risk of incomplete removal and possible regrowth of the lesion. To study the incidence of this complication, 52 patients with cholesteatoma had elective repeated explorations at various postoperative intervals; 8 (15.4%) had early cholesteatoma regrowth even though there was no clinical evidence of it. Seven of these regrowths were small and were again surgically removed. It is advocated that conservative surgery for cholesteatoma be followed up in 2 yr by another elective surgical exploration to check for and dispose of possible cholesteatoma regrowth. This would provide safety comparable to that achieved with radical mastoidectomy, with far better function and hearing. The method does necessitate patient understanding and cooperation and methods of achieving this are suggested.

T1  - Middle ear ventilation function in patients with myringoplasty alone and myringoplasty plus mastoidectomy
AB  - In this study we investigated the correlation between middle ear pressure changes in patients with myringoplasty alone and together with intact canal wall mastoidectomy. The tympanometric values of 102 patients with myringoplasty alone and 78 patients with myringoplasty plus intact canal wall mastoidectomy were examined by tympanometric analysis in this retro-prospective study. The study population consisted of 130 male and 50 female patients (mean age 25.3+/-7.7). All patients underwent myringoplasty with or without mastoidectomy due to chronic otitis without cholesteatoma. Patients with a value of less than -100 daPa during the postoperative follow-up were considered having normal middle ear ventilation. Independent-samples t-test was used for comparison of the analyses results of groups. Sixty patients with myringoplasty (58.8%) and 55 patients with intact canal wall mastoidectomy (70.5%) had middle ear pressures less than -100 daPa at three months after surgery. The percentage of recovery over the first three years was 70.5% and 76.9% in the myringoplasty and intact canal wall mastoidectomy groups, respectively. The rate of persistent negative pressure is 21.6% and 14.1% in the myringoplasty and intact canal wall mastoidectomy groups, respectively. The number of patients who had negative middle ear pressure in myringoplasty group was higher than the number of those in intact canal wall mastoidectomy group at all intervals. However, when the rate of normalization over time was compared between two groups, no significant difference was found (p>0.05). In first three months, the significantly higher number of patients achieving normal middle ear ventilation in mastoidectomy group compared to the patients without mastoidectomy is a finding which supports the additional effect of mastoidectomy on the pressure normalization function. However, the rate of normalization over time is not different between two groups. Middle ear pressure normalization is a continuous dynamic process and improvements may be seen for up to one year.

T1  - Use of a hyaluronan-based biomembrane in the treatment of chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a hyaluronan-based biomembrane in stimulating the healing process in patients undergoing tympanomastoid surgery. STUDY DESIGN: The trial was an open, two-arm, controlled, randomized, prospective, multicenter study conducted at two different hospitals. PATIENTS: Sixty subjects (18-65 years of age, both sexes) with chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media were enrolled and treated by the "one-stage open technique." Efficacy and safety parameters were assessed at 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 21, and 25 weeks after surgery. Three sets of composite criteria were considered: patient's assessment of quality of healing, otomicroscopy, and audiometry. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 50 completed the study. Subjects treated with the biomembrane had statistically significant better scores than controls (no treatment) for all variables considered, excluding audiometry (no significant differences). No adverse events occurred in treated patients. CONCLUSION: Data demonstrate that the application of a hyaluronan-based biomembrane improves the healing of the mastoid cavity following "open" tympanoplasty. In particular, re-epithelialization was significantly faster after the application of the biomembrane. Moreover, the device neither caused any adverse events nor showed signs of ototoxicity. Re-epithelialization of open cavities and tympanic grafts still represents for surgeons an unpredictable step in the healing process. Hyaluronian-derivates may effectively contribute to the reduction of such variability.

T1  - Chronic otitis media: Surgical failures and management
AB  - Failure of primary tympanomastoid surgery to control chronic otitis is a difficult otologic problem. The facial nerve, middle fossa dura, and inner ear structures are at high risk because of distorted anatomy from the primary surgery and/or recurrent disease. In this article our techniques and experience with 42 revision procedures for recurrent chronic otitis with and without cholesteatoma are presented. Control of ot-orrhea and/or cholesteatoma was achieved in 93% of the cases; however, this might be less after 5 years of follow-up. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 25 dB, and this is a 6 dB improvement from the preoperative level. Revision tympanomastoid surgery was very effective and safe in the management of this difficult problem. For cholesteatoma in particular, the canal wall down technique is our procedure of choice.

T1  - F8.05 surgical management of cholesteatomas extending into the petrous bonE
AB  - Cholesteatomas of the petrous pyramid may be of either the acquired or congenital variety. Big cholesteatomas may develop as an extension from the mastoid into the perilabyrinthine region. They also can be congenital and usually formed at the level of the geniculate ganglion in the supralabyrinthine area of the petrous bone between the semicircular canals and the facial nerve. Exposure is obtained via lateral transtemporal approach and postauricular incision. Initial radical mastoidectomy is followed by labyrinthectomy except in the unusual case of useful hearing. The facial nerve is mobilised. The islhmus of the eustachian tube is obliterated. It is important to emphasise that one must not hesitate to sacrifice the cochlea and transpose the facial nerve in order to gain access to the cholesteatoma in the perilabyrinthine area. Following disease removal, the decision to obliterate and exteriorise the cavity is made. The risk associated with obliterations is profuse CSF leak. Obliteration is done after meticulous removal of cholesteatoma and air cells. Facial function monitoring and assessment is helpful. Close postoperative follow-up is mandatory following surgical removal of the petrous pyramid cholesteatoma. especially if there are new symptoms, such as pain or headache. MRI is useful for follow-up at yearly/two yearly intervals.

T1  - Cholesteatomas with Attic Perforation Closure during Preoperative Treatment
AB  - Four cases of cholesteatoma with attic perforation closure during preoperative treatment are reported. Though the tympanic membrane findings after the closure of the perforation appeared similar to those during the healing process of cholesteatoma, we confirmed the presence of cholesteatoma behind the tympanic membrane because of findings before the closure. All cases were treated by intact canal wall tympanoplasty and the cholesteatoma was removed. The conditions that allow the perforation to close easily are small perforation, difficultly in removing the polyp and localized inflammation in the perforation. To avoid overlooking a cholesteatoma when the perforation has closed, careful observation and treatment under a microscope from the initial examination is most important.

T1  - Functional middle ear and mastoid surgery (FMMS)
AB  - Objective: To present a new surgical concept, functional middle ear and mastoid surgery (FMMS), which is aimed to improve the results of chronic ear surgery in the 21st century. Setting: Tertiary Care Center Study Design: Clinical Prospective Study. Methods: A surgical roadmap, based on a new clinico-radiological staging system (TMC) of middle ear cholesteatoma, is outlined. Patients: 120 patients of tympanomastoid cholesteatoma were included in this study. They were preoperatively staged, operated by (FMMS) system, followed up and results reported. Results: Anterior tympanotomy was done in all the cases. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy was done in 79 percent, while open mastoidectomy was performed in 11 percent, and no mastoidectomy was required in 10 percent of the cases. Residual and recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 6.7 percent (6/95) of cases, all after Intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy.The overall (n=120) pre- and post-operative (at least 12 months after surgery) four frequency PTA-AB6 were 33.40 Â± 7.22 dB and 12.42 Â± 5.6 dB. Conclusions: Due to the changing trends in the presentations of chronic ear disease, as well as the advances in its diagnosis and treatment, FMMS presents a logical surgical solution for tympano-mastoid cholesteatoma in the 21st century It stresses the fact that the middle ear should be the primary target of otosurgeons to clear pathology and reconstruct the hearing mechanism. Mastoidectomy is performed, only if necessary, to approach the middle ear posteriorly and to clear pathology extensions if needed.

T1  - Clinical aspects and surgical outcomes of congenital cholesteatoma in 93 children: Increasing trends of congenital cholesteatoma from 1997 through 2012
AB  - Background and Objectives: The recent increase in the reported incidence of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) may be secondary to the widespread use of otoendoscopy as well as an increased awareness of these lesions among primary care physicians. However, little research about CC has been conducted in a large group of patients. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of CC including the annual number of patients, symptoms, age at diagnosis, stage and type of disease, surgical techniques, recurrence, and postoperative complications. Subjects and Methods: Retrospective chart review was performed for patients who met the inclusion criteria between January 1997 and June 2012. Results: Ninety-three patients underwent surgery for CC. The age at operation ranged from 12 months to 17 years (mean age, 6.1 years). The number of patients was less than 4 per year until 2005, but increased to more than 10 per year since 2008. CC was most commonly reported as an incidental finding (58.1%). The operative procedures included the transcanal myringotomy approach (46.2%), canal wall up mastoidectomy (37.6%), tympanoplasty (8.6%), and canal wall down mastoidectomy (7.5%). The recurrence rate was 20.4% and the complication rate was 12.9%. No patients with stage I CC had complications. Conclusions: This study showed that the incidence of CC has recently increased notably. Most patients with stage I and II CC were completely cured by transtympanic surgery, and complication and recurrence rates increased according to the extent of disease. Early detection of CC is important to facilitate minimally invasive surgery and to reduce complication and recurrence rates. Â© 2016 The Korean Audiological Society.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration with silicone blocks after canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - Objectives. To evaluate the usefulness of silicone blocks as graft material for mastoid cavity obliteration in the prevention of problematic mastoid cavities after canal wall down mastoidectomies.Methods. Retrospective evaluation of 20 patients who underwent mastoid obliteration with silicone blocks between 2002 and 2009 at the Chonnam National University Hospital. The cases consisted of 17 patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and 3 patients with adhesive otitis media. The postoperative follow-up period was an average 49 months (range, 6 to 90 months). The surgical technique used at our institution composed four major steps: First, the canal wall down mastoidectomy was performed and the middle ear procedure was completed. The silicone blocks were used to fill up the mastoidectomized cavity. Then, a cortical bone pate was used to cover the surface of the silicone blocks. Finally, temporalis fascia and a split musculoperiosteal flap were used to surround the bone pate for reinforcement of the reconstructed canal wall. We examined postoperative success rate and hearing outcomes.Results. In 19 cases (95%), the reconstructed canal wall maintained a cylindrical shape and the ear drum healed without perforation. In only 1 case (5%), the reconstructed canal wall was destroyed with ear drum perforation. The mean improvement in air-bone gap was about 12 dB (P<0.05), and the mean improvement in air-conduction was about 16 dB (P<0.05).Conclusion. We suggest that silicone blocks could be valuable resources as graft materials for mastoid obliteration after canal wall down mastoidectomies.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Comparison between canal wall-down and canal wall-up techniques in surgery for chronic otitis media
AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media (COM) is an inflammatory condition associated with otorrhea as well as large and persistent perforations of the tympanic membrane in some cases. COM can also lead to cholesteatoma. Surgical treatment with canal walldown and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is considered for both types of illness. The choice of technique is controversial and is dependent on several factors, including the extent of disease. Objective: We aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes in COM patients with and without cholesteatoma treated with canal walldown and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Disease eradication and post-operative auditory thresholds were assessed. Method: Patient records from the otorhinolaryngology department of a tertiary hospital were assessed retrospectively. Results: Patients who underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy had a higher rate of revision surgery, especially those with cholesteatoma. However, there were no statistically significant differences in post-operative hearing thresholds between the two techniques. Conclusion: The canal wall-down technique is superior to the canal wall-up technique, especially for patients with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Prospective study of the mastoid plasties using resorbable bioceramic MBCPÂ® in surgery of cholesteatoma
AB  - Tympanoplasty is the reference for cholesteatoma treatment in ENT surgery, with the realization of a closing technique, which preserves the external auditory canal. An insufficient pneumatisation is an element favoring the occurrence and recurrence of cholesteatoma. In a prospective clinical pilot study, we have realized the reconstruction of the mastoid cortical bone by a Micro Macroporous Biphasic Calcium Phosphate bioceramics disks (MBCPâ¢ Biomatlante France) using the closed technique, in order to maintain or increase the mastoid pneumatization. Eleven patients were used for this study, and some of them have a sample collection for histomorphometry and histopathological analysis. Bone regeneration at the expense of the bioceramic was observed. The size and shape of the disk was not preserved due to the large resorption and bone ingrowth at the expense of the implant. However 6 patients presented cholesteatoma recurrence. The MBCPâ¢ disks are able to reconstruct the mastoid cortical and maintain the mastoid pneumatization contrarily to the technique of filling the mastoid cavity. However, the high rate of cholesteatoma recurrence observed in our study, confirmed the interest to fill mastoid that suppress airspace posterior cavities. Â© 2017 Trans Tech Publications.

T1  - CO2microlaser treatment for post operative complication following radical middle ear surgery
AB  - It has been difficult to treat chronic otorrhea of post-operative complication following middle ear surgery. Low power CO2 microlaser surgery was applied in 14 cases of infectious chronic otorrher assocoated with radical mastoidectomy of middle ear cholesteatoma. Laser was irradiated at the low level from 1 to 5 watts by defocused beam.Otorrhea was completely stopped in 7 cases and remarkedly decreased in 6 cases. This treatment showed remarkable improvement of infectious region in the middle ear cavity and induced good reepithelization within 3 weeks without any operative complication. This results indicated low power CO2laser treatment was very safe and usefull for removal infectious soft tissue as well as wound healing in the opened middle ear cavity compared with conventional treatment.

T1  - MRI as an Alternative to Second Look Mastoid Surgery
AB  - The main goal of surgery of cholesteatoma is eradication of the disease and revision surgery is indicated when a dry and safe ear has not been achieved. Residual cholesteatoma usually occurs at the sites that are difficult to reach with an operating microscope, such as posterior tympanum and anterior epitympanic recess. Computed tomography can be performed to delineate the extent of disease. High-resolution computed tomography scanning is important for planning for surgery and is indicated for all revision mastoid operations. Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computed tomography in tissue characterization for diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma. To evaluate the cases of recurrent cholesteatoma comparing the intraoperative surgical findings with the preoperative MRI radiological findings and if the preoperative MRI can replace the second look surgery for cholesteatoma. This study was applied on 60 patients that have a recurrent cholesteatoma after previous mastoid surgery. A preoperative radiological evaluation was done by Magnetic resonance, surgical management was done by canal wall up or canal wall down mastoidectomy to exclude residual disease. Then, radiological, and surgical findings correlation was done. Diffusion-weighted MRI successfully detected 42 cases out of the 45 cases of surgically proved cholesteatoma, it has accuracy 95%, sensitivity 93.33%, specificity 100%, PPV 100% and NPV 83.33%. MRI is better than CT in tissue characterization for diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma, and can replace the unnecessary second look surgery of cholesteatoma Â© 2018, Association of Otolaryngologists of India.

T1  - Posterior Canal Wall Defect After Intact Canal Wall Tympanoplasty. âAnalysis of Findings in Two Stage Operationsâ
AB  - The incidence and location of the posterior canal wall defect were studied in 175 ears of 167 patients who underwent planned two-stage tympanoplasty by the intact canal wall technique during the last ten years. Of the 84 ears with intact scutum, the bony defect was present in 14 ears at the first operation, and in 12 of these at the second operation. Ten ears developed bony defects between the first and second operations, although the canal wall had been primarily preserved. This was ascribed to atrophy of the posterior canal wall. Of the 91 ears with destruction of the scutum, bony defects other than of the scutum were present in 12 ears at both operations. Canal wall atrophy was present in 16 of the 91 ears. Canal wall defects were listed according to Weinberg's classification. In the canal wall atrophy group, Type A lesions (a round hole in the middle of the canal wall) were seen in 20 ears;Type B lesions (a semicircular defect in the interior wall) in 3 ears;Type C lesions (a semicircular defect in the exterior wall) in 3 ears. Type D lesions (bony destruction along the entire length of the posterior wall) were not seen. Â© 1991, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Retrospective analysis of the middle ear diseases operated
AB  - The clinical records of 223 patients of the middle ear diseases, excluding the malignant tumors, operated on at the Department of Otolaryngology of University of Tsukuba Hospital from March 1988 to March 1998 were reviewed. Two hundred and seventy-six ears underwent the ear surgeries, including 8 of staged surgery and 23 of revision. The majority of patients (132 ears; 47.8%) were diagnosed as chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, and 58, 40 and 12 ears were diagnosed as chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, ossicular fixation or discontinuity and otosclerosis, respectively. Myringoplasty, tympanoplasty, stapes sugery, radical mastoidectomy and others were performed in 17, 202, 25, 18 and 14 ears, respectively. Columellization from the head of stapes was performed in 104 ears and from the footplate in 26 ears. Of the 188 ears, a trimmed tragal cartilage were used in 154 ears for the reconstruction of the ossicular chain and an artificial ossicular reconstructive prosthesis (PORP or TORP) was used in 28 ears. The overall success rate as to an improved hearing was 81.8%; there was no significant difference between the cases of chronic otitis media with (78.4%) and without cholesteatoma (78.0%), nor between the intact canal (88.0%) and canal down (75.3%) cases operated on for the surgical treatment in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Preventive Measures of Recurrent Cholesteatoma
AB  - Recently, there seems an increasing criticism against the use of intact canal wall technique for cholesteatoma cases due to a high incidence of recurrent diseases. In order to study possible causes and effective preventive measures of recurrent cholesteatomas the author has reviewed 426 revision cases operated on during the past 9 years, 121 of which were with cholesteatoma, and 37 âstaged tympanoplasty. cases, 17 of which were with recurrent cholesteatoma. The conclusions drawn were ; 1. Combined approach tympanoplasty should be performed by a well trained and skilled otologic surgeon. 2. Although one stage combined approach tympanoplasty may be possible for cases where non-infected cholesteatoma is restricted in the attic, staged tympanoplasty should be used for extensive, infected, or child cholesteatomas. 3. Combined approach tympanoplasty should be avoided in cases where cholesteatoma has extended into the tympanic sinus. 4. In combined approach tympanoplasty the posterior bony wall should not be too thinned because it may be absorbed later. 5. The defected lateral wall of the attic should be reconstructed with cartilage and a silastic sheet should be used to prevent adhesions of the tympanic membrane. Gelfoam should not be used in the middle ear in large amount. 6. Combined approach tympanoplasty should not be used for cases with eustachian tube dysfunction.

T1  - Clinical usefulness of modified bondy operation for management of cholesteatomas
AB  - Background and Objectives: Bondy operation is a type of modified radical mastoidectomy whose operation window is through an external auditory canal via removal of superior and posterior walls without management of the middle ears. However, the usefulness of this operation is unclear. This study aimed to review our clinical experience of modified Bondy operations and to clarify its usefulness. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patients underwent a modified Bondy operation at the Department of Ajou University Hospital between 1996 and 2010. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed including age, gender, chief complaint, diagnosis, pure tone average (PTA, a mean threshold of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz before and 3 months after the operation), otoscopic finding, temporal bone computed tomography, and recurrence rate. Results: The mean age of the 15 patients was 35.3Â±14 (range 18-65) years. Post-operative diagnosis of all cases was cholesteatoma (nine attic, three external auditory canal, one sinus, and two recurrent). Pre- and postoperative PTAs were 27.4Â±18.3 dBHL and 26.0Â±10.7 dBHL, respectively (p=0.72). No postoperative recurrence or complications were noted over at least a 3- month follow-up. Conclusions: Modified Bondy operation is a good option to preserve hearing and prevent recurrence after operations in cases of cholesteatoma with relatively preserved middle ears.

T1  - A Study of Middle Ear Surgery âConducted in the Past Few Yearsâ
AB  - The outcome of operations on 68 ears, which we performed between 1986 and 1988 was reviewed. We carried out pure-tone audiometory in these cases. Surgery was done for cholesteatoma in 44.1%; for chronic suppurative otitis media in 55.9%; and for the second time in 11.8%. Especially 8.8% had both operations done by us. Thirty two ears underwent intact canal wall tympanoplasty; 30 ears, classical tympanoplasty; and 6 ears, radical mastoidectomy. Postoperatively hearing was improved in 52.5 % of the ears in which the tymponoplasty was carried out. Â© 1989, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Mastoid cavity obliteration with cartilage graft; evaluation of 35 patients
AB  - Objective: Cartilage is a rigid material that is highly resistant to infection and retraction and is tolerated well by the middle ear. The purpose of this study was to review retrospectively the results of cases of mastoid cavity obliteration with cartilage performed after canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy and to discuss the literature. Method: Of 983 patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media between January 2000 and June 2012, 54 patients who underwent CWD mastoidectomy plus mastoid cavity obliteration with cartilage and who were followed up regularly were selected from the database and invited for re-evaluation. All patients who came for a follow up after the invitation were examined and their data were evaluated retrospectively. Results: Thirty-five of the patients who accepted the invitation were included in the study. All of the patients in the study underwent mastoid cavity obliteration with conchal and/or tragal cartilage grafts. The duration of follow up ranged from 21 to 41 months (average, 27.3 months). Epithelization occurred in all patients with dry cavity, except one who had residual cholesteatoma and underwent revision surgery. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that cartilage can be preferred for obliteration of mastoid cavity after CWD mastoidectomy. Â© Istanbul Medeniyet University Faculty of Medicine.

T1  - F5.04 otosurgical concepts for otogenic complications
AB  - Otogenic complications are rare. We report our experience with 42 patients (31 male, 11 female; 11 of the patients were children) with severe complica-lions of cases of acute or chronic otitis media. We observed 24 cases of acute mastoiditis, 5 cases of temporal brain abscesses. 8 cases of meningitis. 9 cases of facial nerve palsy and 6 cases with a labyrinthine fistula. The reasons for the complications were in 74%, an acute or subacute mastoiditis; in 19%. an untreated cholesteatoma; and in 7%, a tumorous lesion. All patients were operated on by mastoidectomy or radical ear operation. Four patients died due to intracranial problems, whereas in 90.4% healing of the patients followed. The analysis shows that otogenic complications should be handled immediately and with care. Otogenic intracranial complications can he dramatic and need otosurgical intervention. CT and MRI are helpful in early diagnosis and should be used early in cases of suspected complications of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Long-term outcomes from blind sac closure of the external auditory canal: Our institutional experience in different pathologies
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study reports long-term results of blind sac closure of the external auditory canal performed for various pathologies, compares the complication rates and the need for revision surgery. MATERIALS and METHODS: This study is a retrospective review. Ninety-six cases of blind sac closure performed for various pathologies were included in this study. The primary pathologies included extensive mucosal disease in an open mastoid cavity, cholesteatoma, skull base lesion, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and osteoradionecrosis of the temporal bone. Preoperative history, postoperative complications, and the need for revision surgery were evaluated. RESULTS: The most common indication for blind sac closure in our series involved skull base lesions (62.5%). The mean follow-up period was 46 months (4 months â 20 years). The total complication rate related to blind sac closure was 10.4%. The median time between surgery and long-term complications was 5.5 years. Patients with chronic mucosal disease had the highest rate of complications. CONCLUSION: Blind sac closure of external meatus can be effectively performed for different pathologies. Long-term follow-up with patients is necessary. Patients with chronic mucosal disease have the highest complication rates. Â© 2020, AVES. All rights reserved.

T1  - Does Endoscopic Surgery Reduce Recurrence of the Petrous Apex Cholesteatoma?
AB  - The aim of this study is to present the clinical symptoms, complications and treatments of the petrous apex cholesteatoma and is to describe the current role of oto-endoscopy. This was a retrospective non-randomized study of 14 petrous apex cholesteatoma surgeries performed between 1994 and 2012. Petrosectomy was performed according to the location of the cholesteatoma, hearing level of the patients and facial nerve function. Oto-endoscopy was used in the petrous apex and the cerebellopontine angle for residual cholesteatoma. 14 patients, seven were men and seven women were included in this study between 1994-2012. The most common symptom was hearing loss (85.7 %) and tinnitus (50 %) at the presentation. During the surgeries, it was observed that cholesteatoma involved most frequently facial nerve, dura and labyrinthines. Labyrinthectomy, middle cranial fossa approach and petromastoidectomy was performed to these patients. Four of six patients operated without the endoscope assistance between 1994-2006 had recurrences after the operation. These patients were re-operated and in the follow up, there was no recurrence. In the endoscopy assisted surgery, there was no recurrence observed (significance level p = 0.014). The most common complication after the surgery was hearing loss (42.8 %) but it was not significant after surgery (p > 0.05). The petrous apex and mastoid cavity was obliterated with fat tissue in eight patients while six patients were exteriorized to follow the recurrence and it was insignificant in recurrences (p > 0.05) Conclusion: Endoscope-assisted surgery allows to remove residual the cholesteatoma around the carotid artery, dura and facial nerve in the petrous apex resulting in less invasive surgery and less recurrence in blind spots.

T1  - Obliteration of radical cavities and total reconstruction procedure without staging after canal wall down mastoidectomy: Long-term results
AB  - Objectives. We evaluate the long-term surgical and hearing results using a canal wall down mastoidectomy technique followed by cavities obliteration, canal wall reconstruction and ossiculoplasty without staging. Methods. A total of 44 patients between January 2002 and October 2009 were selected and 27 of them were revision cases. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone average (PTA) and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed and compared 1 and 4 years after surgery. Results. The middle ear was well healed and aerated in 40 patients (90.9%) and the tympanic membrane was intact in 42 patients (95.5%). Recurrent cholesteatoma was found on postoperative follow-up in two of the revision patients (7.4%) but none in the primary patients. Seven patients were found to have partial canal bone absorption, but revision surgery was not required. Over 86.4% of all cases were water resistant. Long-lasting improvement and/or preservation of hearing, with maintenance of PTA-ABG closure in 63.7% of all cases within 20 dB, were obtained. Conclusion. The efficacy of our technique after a canal wall down mastoidectomy is satisfactory, and the rate of complication is acceptably low. We believe that our technique could be a convenient method in disease control and providing an excellent basis for hearing restoration simultaneously.

T1  - Blind sac approach using silastic block for cochlear implantation in patients with cholesteatoma
AB  - Cochlear implant (CI) surgery in cholesteatoma is challenging because of the risk of residual or recurrent infection. Although CI could be done with subtotal petrosectomy in single or staged surgery, this surgery needed additional surgical procedures to obliterate the mastoid cavity. This paper describes a new surgical technique for CI surgery in cholesteatoma without external auditory canal closure. Â© 2017 The Korean Audiological Society and Korean Otological Society.

T1  - Clinical Study on the Pre-Operative Hearing in the Radical Mastoid Operation
AB  - Clinical observation was made on 112 cases of middle ear infection treated by radical mastoidectomy. The air and bone conduction audiometry were done before and after the operation. Objects were divided into five different groups from the degree of the pre-operative air conduction hearing. In each group, the changes of the post-operative bone and air conduction were studied, and the relationship between the changes of hearing and the state of the tympanic membrane, the impairment of auditory ossicles, the existence of cholesteatoma, and the duration of otorrhoea, were observed. From the results, the author stated that the pre-operative hearing of chronic suppurative otitsl media treated by radical mastoidectomy was mainly influenced by the state of the perforation of the tympanic membrane, the bone conduction hearing, and the sound transmitting ability of pathologicai conductive apparatus including the ossicles and healty tissues of the middle ear.

T1  - Histological Studies of the Regenerated Mucosa in the Mastoid Cavity after Tympanoplasty
AB  - To observe mucosa regeneration in the mastoid cavity after tympanoplasty using silicone sheeting was examined in 31 patients with cholesteatoma and 7 with chronic otitis media who were operated on with the technique of staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty. In the first operation, the surface of the denuded bone was covered with 0.2-0.5 mm silicone sheets. At the second operation 5-14 months after the first operation, 38 specimens from the anterior or posterior wall, and 25 specimens from the innermost wall of the mastoid cavity were taken and studied histologically. The specimens were histologically divided into four groups: granulation tissue, mixed tissue of granulation and scar, scar tissue and normal mucous membrane. Of the 38 specimens from the anterior or posterior wall, three showed granulation tissue, 16 mixed tissue of granulation and scar, and 19 scar tissue; normal mucous membrane was not found. In 8 patients who were operated on about 12 months after the first operation, only the single or multi-layered flattened epithelium had regenerated over the scar tissue. Of the 25 specimens from the innermost wall, 14, which had been attic type cholesteatoma, had normal mucous membranes. In 5 of the normal mucous membrane specimens, ciliated cells were observed on the free surface of the mucous membrane. These results suggest that more than one year is required for regeneration of the mucous membrane in the mastoid cavity after tympanoplasty. Â© 1986, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Surgery for chronic otitis media and mastoid air cell systems
AB  - In reviewing a history of surgery for middle ear inflammation from the primitive simple mastoidectomy to the latest tympanoplasty, opening and eradication of the mastoid air cell systems are essentially performed. In radical mastoidectomy, the mastoidectomy cavity was widely opened to the external auditory meatus, and this procedure results in destroying the air cell systems and forming abnormal anatomical structure. Several surgical techniques were proposed to manage the mastoidectomy cavity. Mastoidectomy preserving posterior wall of external auditory meatus, so called âclosed methodâ of tympamoplasty, was one of the technique to dissolve the problem. In this method, the mastoidectomy cavity opened to the tympanic cavity instead of external auditory meatus. Increased aeration volume of the middle ear cavity was supplied only through the Eustachian tude, and its dysfunction induced tympanic membrane retraction and cholesteatoma formation. Importance and necessity of the air cell systems were observed by clinical examinations and experiments using piglet, whose middle ear has air cell systems resembling to human middle ear, and our results showed that the mucosa of air cell systems performed active gas-exchange and maintained middle ear pressure. According to these results, an importance of preserving gas-exchange capacity of the air cell systems in the mastoid surgery was described. Â© 1997, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo.

T1  - Intentional Residual Cholesteatomas in Planned Staged Tympanoplasty
AB  - We treated 187 primary cases of cholesteatoma by mastoid surgery between 1985 and 1990. Of 187 cases, 137 cases underwent tympanoplasty. Although we performed radical surgery on cases which had the matrix tightly adhering to the foot plate, we have recently carried out planned staged tympanoplasty with an intact canal wall technique. In 4 cases, we have intentionally left a tiny part of the matrix during the initial surgery to avoid surgical damage to the inner ear. Each remnant of the matrix had formed a keratin-containing cyst resembling a pearl by the time of the second surgery and in all the cases, these cysts could be easily removed without causing any inner ear damage.

T1  - Recent Trends in Surgery of Chronic Otitis Media
AB  - Purpose of the present study is to learn the recent trends in surgery of chronic otitis media, particularly of cholesteatoma, in various areas of the world by sending questionnaires to otologic surgeons in the US, Europe and Japan.<BR>This study which was confined to those cases operated on during the year of 1977 revealed that:<BR>1. Frequency of mastoidectomy in non-cholesteatoma while it was over 60% in Japan.<BR>2. The homograft tympanic membrane is used more frequently in Europe than in the US.<BR>3. Frequency of radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 11% in Europe, 18% in the US and 21% in Japan.<BR>4. The frequency of modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 26% in the US, 23% in Europe and 15% in Japan.<BR>5. The frequency of tympanoplasty.without mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 13% in the US and Europe while it was 6% in Japan.<BR>6. Frequency of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 43% in the US, 53% in Europe and 58% in Japan.<BR>7. In the US and Japan the frequency of tympanoplasty with removal (without reconstruction) of the posterior canal wall was about 45% to 50% of all tympanoplaty cases for cholesteatoma while it was 29% in Europe.<BR>8. Reconstruction after removal of posterior canal wall in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma was more frequent in Europe than in the US or in Japan.<BR>9. In intact canal wall technique for cholesteatoma, it is a recent trend in the US and Europe that a greater number of tympanoplasty are performed as staged operation.

T1  - A post-tympanoplasty evaluation of the factors affecting development of myringosclerosis in the graft: A clinical study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Myringosclerosis (MS) is a pathological condition characterized by hyaline degeneration and calcification of the collagenous structure of the fibrotic layer of the tympanic membrane, which may develop after trauma, infection, or inflammation as myringotomy, insertion of a ventilation tube, or myringoplasty. The aim of our study was to both reveal and evaluate the impact of the factors that might be effective on the post-tympanoplasty development of myringosclerosis in the graft. MATERIALS and METHODS: In line with this objective, a total of 108 patients (44 males and 64 females) aged between 11 and 66 years (mean age, 29.5 years) who had undergone type 1 tympanoplasty (TP) with an intact canal wall technique and type 2 TP, followed up for an average of 38.8 months, were evaluated. In the presence of myringosclerosis, in consideration of the tympanic membrane (TM) quadrants involved, the influential factors were analyzed in our study, together with the development of myringosclerosis, including preoperative factors, such as the presence of myringosclerosis in the residual and also contralateral tympanic membrane, extent and location of the perforation, and perioperative factors, such as tympanosclerosis in the middle ear and mastoid cavity, cholesteatoma, granulation tissue, and type of the operation performed. For statistical analysis of data, independent samples t-test was used. RESULTS: Our study comprised 44 male and 64 female patients. Median postoperative follow-up period was estimated as 38.8 months. The rate of postoperative development of myringosclerosis in grafts was significantly higher in patients with already existing sclerotic foci in TM (p=0.001). The location of the perforation had no effect on the postoperative development of MS in the graft (p=0.521). No statistically significant difference was detected between the size of the perforation and formation of MS (p=0.581). Statistical analysis of both groups could not discern any significant intergroup difference as to the impact of the presence or absence of cholesteatoma on the development and extent of MS (p=0.604). Impact of tympanosclerosis on the postoperative development and extent of MS in the graft was significant (p=0.001). Presence or absence of granulation tissue on the development or extent of myringosclerosis was not detected (p=0.697). Myringosclerotic foci in the contralateral ears had a statistically significant effect on the postoperative development and extent of MS in the grafts (p=0.001). Type of surgery performed did not exert any significant effect on the development or extent of myringosclerosis (p=0.765). CONCLUSION: We have determined that the presence of myringosclerosis in the residual membrane and in the contralateral tympanic membrane and tympanosclerosis in the middle ear have a significant role in the development of postoperative myringosclerosis in the tympanic membrane, contrary to the type of the surgical intervention, location and extent of perforation, presence of cholesteatoma, and granulation tissue.

T1  - Labyrinthine Fistula-Our Experience at a Tertiary Hospital
AB  - This study has aimed to determine the anatomical site of labyrinthine fistula in patients of chronic suppurative otitis media at our centre. Labyrinthine fistulae (LF) are caused by abnormal communications between the inner ear and surrounding structuresÂ resulting in perilymph leakage and hearing loss. Labyrinthine fistula represents as erosive loss of the enchondral bone overlying the semicircular canals without loss of perilymph. The manifestations of fistula like vertigo, hearing loss vary in severity and complexity, commonly ranging from very mild to incapacitating. Cholesteatoma induced fistula most commonly involves lateral semicircular canal probably because of its close proximity to the middle ear, but can involve other semicircular canals and rarely cochlea. This is a retrospective analysis of 36 patients of chronic suppurative otitis media with history of vertigo undergoing tympanomastoid surgery in whom there was an evidence of labyrinthine fistula on HRCT scan of temporal bone. The incidence of patients with labyrinthine fistula presenting with vertigo, nystagmus, sensorineural hearing loss, history of vertigo were analysed. The anatomical location of the fistula was supported by Radiological evidence. Patients underwent either canal wall down mastoidectomy or cortical mastoidectomy. The anatomical site and length of the labyrinthine fistula were analysed. Amongst the 36 patients of chronic suppurative otitis media with labyrinthine fistula 22 (61.1%) patients had atticoantral disease, 4 (11.1%) patients had chronic otitis media with extensive granulation, 2 (5.5%) patients had Tubotympanic disease with polyps, 4 (11.1%) patients had Tuberculous otitis media, 1 (2.77%) patient had Tubotympanic disease with extensive tympanosclerosis eroding the dome of lateral semicircular canal, 1 (2.77%) patient had extensive cholesteatoma with cerebellar abscess, 1 (2.77%) patient had fistula in the promontory following trauma, 1 (2.77%) patient had extensive tympanosclerosis with erosion of promontory. It was noticed that, in 14 (38.88%) patients the fistula was at the centre, in 17 (47.22%) patients the fistula is towards the ampullary end of horizontal semicircular canal and in 5 (13.88%) patients the fistula was towards the non ampullary end of lateral semicircular canal. The maximum length of fistula noticed was 6Â mm and the minimum length of the fistula noticed was 2Â mm. Labyrinthine fistula are most commonly noticed in the ampullary end of the lateral semicircular canal. The average length of the fistula was found to be 4Â mm. Careful elevation of the cholesteatoma matrix over the endosteal membrane and immediate placement of temporal fascia over the exposed fistula is important to avoid injury to the inner ear. Maximum number of fistula were seen in the atticoantral type of Chronic suppurative otitis media. Prior knowledge of anatomical location of the fistulous tract in HRCT temporal bone is important to address the fistula. Â© 2020, Association of Otolaryngologists of India.

T1  - Factors affecting success and results of cartilage- perichondrium island graft in revision tympanoplasty
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The chance of complete postoperative healing of the tympanic membrane is relatively low due to poor blood supply of the graft in patients who undergo revision tympanoplasty. The aim of this study is to assess postoperative healing and the factors affecting closure of the tympanic membrane and hearing gain after revision tympanoplasty with cartilage-perichondrium island graft. MATERIALS and METHODS: This study was conducted as a retrospective review of charts of patients who underwent revision tympanoplasty with composite cartilage-perichondrium island graft at our clinic. Patients who underwent radical or modified radical mastoidectomy for the treatment of cholesteatoma and who had stapes fixation were excluded. All grafts were placed using over-under technique. Ossiculoplasty and mastoidectomy were performed as needed. Closure of the tympanic membrane and hearing thresholds were evaluated at the end of postoperative year 1. RESULTS: Thirty-three cases, 14 females and 19 males with mean age 37.5Â±12.7, were included in the study. Ossiculoplasty was performed in 8 cases, and mastoidectomy was added to tympanoplasty in 12 cases. Tympanic membrane was intact in 29 cases (87.4%) in the 12th postoperative month. Large perforation, adhesive tympanic membrane, and especially hypertrophic middle ear mucosa were found to have negative impact on success of graft (p<0.01). The success of graft in patients with mastoidectomy was lower than without mastoidectomy (p<0.001). Age (p=0.491), gender (p=0.567), surgical approach (p=0.378), and the number of operations (p=0.283) did not contribute to the success of the graft. Average improvement of postoperative air conduction hearing threshold was 13.2Â±5.5 dB, and average decrease in air bone gap was 11.7Â±5.5 dB. CONCLUSION: Postoperative closure rate of the tympanic membrane was high and audiologic improvement was satisfactory with cartilage-perichondrium island graft in revision tympanoplasty. Cartilage-perichondrium island graft may be preferred for reconstruction of the tympanic membrane because of its resistance to inflammation and poor feeding in revision tympanoplasty.

T1  - Outcome of Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy: A Retrospective Review
AB  - A canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM) is an effective technique for eradication of chronic suppurative otitis media (atticoantral disease) or cholesteatomas. A retrospective study was conducted at R.D. Gardi Medical college between 2015 and 2017 to evaluate the outcome of CWDM for patients with atticoantral type of CSOM. All new cases of MRM/RM which fulfilled the selection criteria were reviewed. The main outcome measures were the hearing outcome and status of dry ear postoperatively. 60 patients of CWDM (32 male, 28 female) were included for analysis. All patients in our study were between 7 and 52Â years with mean age 28.38Â years. The ossicular chain was eroded in all the cases. Improvement in AirâBoneâGap was seen in 11 (18.33%), no change in 38 (63.33%) and 11 (18.33%) had deteriorated. In post operative outcome study of our 60 patients, 76.66% of the patients had dry healed cavity and non healed cavity was found to be in 23.33% of the patients. On analysis of data and comparison with other studies it was found that there are three important factors which influence hearing results and the outcome of surgeryâstatus of ossicular chain, presence or absence of cholesteatoma, recurrence or residual disease.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula secondary to cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media
AB  - Objective: To analyze clinical presentation, preoperative diagnostic methods, surgical treatment and postoperative outcomes of labyrinthine fistula (LF) secondary to cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media. Materials and Methods: Of 582 mastoid surgeries performed, a retrospective review of 33 patients with LF secondary to cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media was performed. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Interventions: Audiologic evaluation with pure tone bone conduction average (PTA-bone) and radiologic imaging studies with temporal bone computed tomography (CT) scanning were evaluated. Open technique with a removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and sealing the fistula site with connective tissue was preferred. Main outcome measures: Auditory results were evaluated as a function of LF size and site. Results: Incidence of LF was 5.7 % (n:33). Isolated fistula of the lateral semicircular canal was found in 25 patients (75.7%), and isolated involvement of the oval window was found in one patient (3%). Multiple fistulas were detected in 7 patients (21.2%). In 31 patients (88.2%), the cholesteatoma was completely removed, and the fistula was sealed; and in 2 patients (5.8%) the matrix was left intact after exteriorization. One patient (3%) presented with anacusis. Postoperatively, hearing remained in the same range in 24 patients (72.7%). In 8 patients (24.2%) a reduction of PTA-bone was observed, and 2 patients (6%) presented with postoperative anacusis. Vertigo improved or disappeared in 14 (42.4%) cases, and remained unchanged in 4 (12.1%) cases. Conclusion: LF is an aggressive complication of cholesteatomous chronic otitis media. The postoperative prognosis is correlated to the size and location of the LF. Copyright 2005 Â© The Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology.

T1  - The intact canal wall approach to tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy
AB  - The last word had not been written concerning the treatment of aural cholesteatoma. Long-term results could change our favorable opinion about the intact canal wall procedure. We have not solved all the problems; indeed, we may not even be aware of some that will develop. Continued study and discussion of the technique should eventually help us reach a relatively unanimous opinion regarding the best method of treatment.

T1  - Modified after palva
AB  - In Aalborg - during 20 months - 93 cases of simple and radical mastoidectomy have been done for acute and chronic otitis media. In the material the chronic cases dominate, especially the very chronic. Totally 43 simple and 50 radical mastoidectomies of varying radicality have been made, cholesteatoma was found in 31 cases (33% fistula of the external canal in 11 cases (12% and in 52 cases (56% the ossicular chain was found interrupted most often by ostitic destruction of crus longum incudis. Great care has been made to remove ostitic bone as thoroughly as possible. In all but 3 cases a muscle obliteration of the cavity has been done. In 83 cases was used a retroauricular muscle flap a little modified after Palva's method. In 3 cases an anteriorly based flap from the temporal muscle and in 4 cases a combination of different muscle flaps were used. The material was evaluated 1-22 months after the operation. It is concluded that muscle obliteration of the cavity after Palva is an easy and technically attractive method in order to obtain a complete or partial obliteration of the cavity. The muscle flap is broadly based, always viable and little bleeding. In no case necrosis or pockets of infection have developed, and the postoperative reactions have been minimal. The simple mastoidectomies almost all have healed up quickly and neatly, and two thirds of the radical cavities have become dry and covered by epithelium. As a whole the methods has given fine results. However, the retroauricular muscle flap seldom will fill out more than half of the cavity. On the medial side of the flap granulation tissue often forms, delaying the final healing. A definite drawback with the method is its weakening of the cover of soft parts over the retroauricular, often very big cavity. Even if we have not had lasting retroauricular fistulae the thin cover has been suspicious in some cases. Â© 1967 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

T1  - Pneumocephalus associated with otogenic meningitis
AB  - Ventricular pneumocephalus was found in a 38-year-old male with cholesteatoma of the middle ear when he developed acute meningitis. The ventricular pneumncephalus became a intracerebral pneumocephalus in about 30 days. Radical mastoidectomy revealed a bone defect at the roof of the antrum exposing the dura mater and a fistula extending into the brain tissue. A pathway into the intracranium at the antrum is considered to be very rare. Culture of the otorrhea did not reveal any gas-producing microorganisms. Granulation tissues were found extending from the orifice of Eustachian tube to the aditus ad antrum. The authors discussed the etiology of the pneumocephalus.

T1  - A Long-Term Follow-Up Study of Middle Ear Surgery âConducted in the 11 years from 1968 to 1978â
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of the long-term follow up of the 325 ears operated upon during the 11 years from 1968 to 1978. According to the 166 patients who answered our questionnaire, ear discharge was complained of in 45 percent of the cases and hearing deterioration in 65 percent thereof. In a total of 115 ears, on which we were able to carry out otoscopic examination and pure-tone audiometry, 49 percent underwent surgery for cholesteatoma; 42 percent, for chronic supperative otitis media; 4 percent, for tuberculosis of the middle ear; and 5 percent received surgery a second time on the middle ear. Of those, 46 ears underwent intact canal wall tympanoplasty; 32 ears, classical tympanoplasty; 19 ears, modified radical mastoidectomy; and 18 ears, radical mastoidectomy. Recurrence of perforation of the reconstructed ear drum was found in 44.7 percent and recurrence of ear discharge was present in 43 percent of the total; in 61 percent of the ears that had received radical mastoidectomy, in 47 percent of those with modified radical mastoidectomy in 56 percent of those with classical tympanoplasty and in 24 percent of those with intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Long-term hearing results were unsatisfactory; only 18.4 percent of the patients experienced improvement in postoperative hearing but postoperative hearing was depressed in 40 percent of the cases.

T1  - Cartilage Island graft tympanoplasty in advanced middle ear disease: Anatomic and audiologic results
AB  - Objective: To present the experience in cartilage island graft tympanoplasty for advanced middle ear pathologies and evaluate its success rate and audiologic results. Materials and Methods: The charts of patients who underwent cartilage island graft tympanoplasty for advanced middle ear disease from September 2006 to March 2009 were reviewed and only oto-endoscopy assisted intact canal wall (ICW) / type 3 tympanoplasty procedures have been included in this study. Reviewed parameters were graft take, change between the preand post operative pure tone average air bone gap (PTA-ABG) and complications. Audiologic evaluation was made among the patients whom complete ear drum closure was achieved Results: Of the 36 procedures, 63.9% were for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, 11.1% for chronic otitis media with polyp, 25% for adhesive otitis/retraction pocket with or without cholesteatoma. TORP was used in 14 cases and PORP in 22. Graft take was achieved 88.9% of the patients. There were two attic perforation with cholesteatoma and two anterior perforation. The overall pre-and postoperative PTA-ABG were 28.91Â± 8.73 dB and 10.42Â±6.10 dB. PORP subgroups had a statistically signifcant better hearing results at 0.5 kHz, 4.0 kHz and average. Conclusion: Results in our study indicate that cartilage island graft is a reliable material in advanced middle ear pathologies with satisfactory anatomical -functional outcomes and it reduces the risk of retraction pockets which can lead to recurrent cholesteatoma.

T1  - Preservation of labyrinth and facial function in extensive cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgery for cholesteatoma is a challenge, especially in extensive cholesteatomas with invasion around the facial nerve and the labyrinth. Presence of facial weakness, vertigo and deafness together with chronic discharge from the ear usually indicates a more advanced disease. One hundred and twenty ears with cholesteatoma were reevaluated; in seventy-two patients an open technique was used and in forty-eight a closed technique. In two patients there was a preoperative facial paresis and one suffered from facial tics preoperatively. The facial function was more frequently deranged in patients with labyrinth erosion than in patients without. In the group of patients where the labyrinth was involved the bone conduction remained unchanged postoperatively, except for a few patients where a slight improvement was noted at frequencies of 500 and 2000 Hz. The improvement of bone conduction in some of the patients is probably dependent on recovery of the inner ear mechanism. A rather high proportion of fistulae patients had an exposed facial nerve and or a preoperative facial dysfunction, which, however, returned to normal postoperatively. As a conclusion, ears with cholesteatoma combined with labyrinthine symptoms are more frequently associated with a dehiscent facial nerve than other ears and disturbed facial function is then more common. During surgery it is important to be aware of the risk of an uncovered facial nerve. Â© 2003, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

T1  - Tympanoplasty
AB  - The study comprises of 164 ears of modified radical mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty performed as one stage operation in our hospital. The ears were followed up for 5 years. Out of these 164 ears, postaural approach was performed in 90 ears and endaural with removal of bone from inside out in 74 ears. Tympanoplasty was performed in all the cases as one stage operation with incus transposition in 42 cases, autogenous cortical bone columella between malleus handle and stapes head in 80 cases, between stapes footplate and graft material in 30 cases and preserved homograft ossicles between stapes footplate and graft in 12 cases. Dry ears with graft take up occurred in 92% cases within 6 to 10 weeks. No recurrence of cholesteatoma was seen. Ossiculoplasty using autogenous cortical bone columellas resulted in somewhat greater improvement in the post operative airbone gap than ossiculoplasty with auto or homograft ossicles. Similarly the post operative gap improved more with an intact stapes superstructure than in ears where the stapes superstructure was absent. The use of a cortical bone can be recommended in cases where the patient's own ossicles are affected by disease and cannot be used. Â© 1988 Association of Otolaryngologists of India.
