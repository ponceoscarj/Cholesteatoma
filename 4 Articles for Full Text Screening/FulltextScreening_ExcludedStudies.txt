T1  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration versus canal wall up mastoidectomy in primary cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to compare disease recidivism rates between canal wall up mastoidectomy and a canal wall down with obliteration technique.METHODS: Patients undergoing primary cholesteatoma surgery at our institution over a five-year period (2013-2017) using the aforementioned techniques were eligible for inclusion in the study. Rates of discharge and disease recidivism were analysed using chi-square statistics.RESULTS: A total of 104 ears (98 patients) were included. The mean follow-up period was 30 months (range, 12-52 months). A canal wall down with mastoid obliteration technique was performed in 55 cases and a canal wall up approach was performed in 49 cases. Disease recidivism rates were 7.3 per cent and 16.3 per cent in the canal wall down with mastoid obliteration and canal wall up groups respectively (p = 0.02), whilst discharge rates were similar (7.3 per cent and 10.2 per cent respectively).CONCLUSION: Our direct comparative data suggest that canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration is superior to a canal wall up technique in primary cholesteatoma surgery, providing a lower recidivism rate combined with a low post-operative ear discharge rate.

T1  - Identification of risk factors for residual cholesteatoma in children and adults: a retrospective study on 110 cases of revision surgery
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Residual disease after cholesteatoma removal is still a challenge for the otorhinolaryngologist. Scheduled "second-look" surgery and, more recently, radiological screenings are used to identify residual cholesteatoma as early as possible. However, these procedures are cost-intensive and are accompanied by discomfort and risks for the patient.OBJECTIVE: To identify anamnestic, clinical, and surgery-related risk factors for residual cholesteatoma.METHODS: The charts of 108 patients, including children as well as adults, having undergone a second-look or revision surgery after initial cholesteatoma removal at a tertiary referral hospital, were analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS: Gender, age, mastoid pneumatization, prior ventilation tube insertion, congenital cholesteatoma, erosion of ossicles, atticotomy, resection of chorda tympani, different reconstruction materials, and postoperative otorrhea did not emerge as statistically significant risk factors for residual disease. However, prior adenoid removal, cholesteatoma growth to the sinus tympani and to the antrum and mastoid, canal-wall-up 2 ways approach, and postoperative retraction and perforation were associated with a statistically higher rate of residual disease. A Type A tympanogram as well as canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach for extended epitympanic and for extended epitympanic and mesotympanic cholesteatomas were associated with statistically lower rates of residual disease. A score including the postoperative retraction or perforation of the tympanic membrane, the quality of the postoperative tympanogram and the intraoperative extension of the cholesteatoma to the sinus tympani and/or the antrum was elaborated and proved to be suitable for predicting residual cholesteatoma with acceptable sensitivity and high specificity.CONCLUSION: Cholesteatoma extension to the sinus tympani, antrum and mastoid makes a residual disease more likely. The canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach seems safe with similar rates of residual cholesteatoma and without the known disadvantages of canal-wall-down surgery. The described score can be useful for identifying patients who need a postoperative radiological control and a second-look surgery.

T1  - Canal wall down versus canal wall up surgeries in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Background/aim: To compare outcomes of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) techniques in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma.Materials and methods: Medical records of 76 patients who had a primary surgery due to middle ear cholesteatoma between July 2015 and November 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Hearing thresholds, speech discrimination scores (SDS), recurrences, and revision surgeries of CWU and CWD surgeries were compared.Results: Of 76 cholesteatoma cases, 40 (52.6%) had a CWU and 36 (47.4%) had a CWD operation. Postoperatively, the mean air conduction thresholds were significantly better in CWU compared to CWD surgeries (P = 0.016). The presence of the stapes and the type of reconstruction material used did not have a significant effect on auditory success rates (P = 0.342 and P = 0.905, respectively). Auditory success was affected by the status of the middle ear mucosa as well. The recurrence and revision rates did not differ between the surgical techniques (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Status of the middle ear mucosa and external auditory canal are important factors affecting the outcomes in cholesteatoma. Instead of a CWD surgery, a CWU surgery seems applicable in cases of cholesteatoma when the bone in the external auditory canal is not eroded by the disease.

T1  - Trans-canal endoscopic ear surgery and canal wall-up tympano-mastoidectomy for pediatric middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical parameters, outcomes and complications of transcanal endoscopic ear surgeries (EES) and canal wall-up tympano-mastoidectomy (CWU) for middle ear cholesteatoma in children and to compare between the two surgical approaches.METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all children (< 16 years) who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma involving the middle ear only with a minimal follow-up period of 12 months. Demographic features, site and extent of disease, outcome and complications were reviewed and compared between the groups.RESULTS: Thirty EES and 19 CWU were included. The overall disease relapse rates in the EES and CWU groups were 20% (n = 6, residual rate = 10%, recurrence rate = 10%) and 47% (n = 9, residual rate = 11%, recurrence rate = 37%), respectively (p = 0.04), with mean duration of follow-up of 32.6 and 37.2 months, respectively. In the EES and CWU groups, the most common site of residual disease was the mastoid cavity/antrum (n = 2, 66% and n = 2, 100%, respectively). Most recurrences involved the epitympanum and extended into the tympanic cavity (n = 2, 66%) in the EES group and into the tympanic cavity, posterior mesotympanum and mastoid cavity/antrum (n = 3, 43%, each) in the CWU group. The overall complication rates in the EES and CWU groups were 10% (n = 3) and 11% (n = 2), respectively (p = 0.61).CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ear surgeries in children were found to be an acceptable and safe technique for the treatment of cholesteatoma limited to the middle ear cavity. A better overall success rate and a similar complication rate were found in the EES group when compared to CWU.

T1  - Surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome: a multicenter experience
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: As in other syndromes characterized by craniofacial anomalies, middle ear cholesteatoma is known to have a high prevalence in Turner syndrome. The aim of this study was to review a multicenter experience with the surgical management of middle ear cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome.METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed sixteen girls with Turner syndrome who underwent otologic surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma between January 2000 and December 2012. Surgery was performed in 3 tertiary care otologic centers. Four patients had bilateral disease, resulting in a total of 20 ears treated. The following data were recorded: age, history of ventilation tube insertion, status of the controlateral ear, cholesteatoma location and extension, and surgical technique involved. Cholesteatoma recidivism, stable mastoid cavity and hearing levels were the main outcomes measured.RESULTS: Follow-up ranged from 3 to 15 years (mean 7 years). Fourteen ears underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy: no cases of recurrent cholesteatoma were observed in these cases; revision mastoidectomy with cavity obliteration was needed in 2 ears (14.3%) for recurrent otorrhea. In the remaining 6 ears a staged canal wall up mastoidectomy was performed: 1 child showed a recurrent cholesteatoma and required conversion to canal wall down mastoidectomy. A postoperative air-bone gap result of 0 to 20 dB was achieved in 6 ears (30%); in 9 ears (45%) postoperative air-bone gap was between 21 and 30 dB, while in 5 (25%) was >30 dB. Bone conduction thresholds remained unaffected in all cases.CONCLUSIONS: Cholesteatoma in children with Turner syndrome is a challenging entity for the otologic surgeon. Although not mandatory, canal wall down mastoidectomy should be regarded as the technique of choice to achieve a safe and dry ear in TS children with middle ear cholesteatoma. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy should be adopted only in appropriately selected patients such as those with limited attic cholesteatoma that can be regularly followed-up.

T1  - Prognostic Factors of Pediatric Revision Ossicular Chain Reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) is a surgical method used to repair conductive hearing loss. In children, up to 40% of OCRs will require revisions. In this study, our aims were to validate improvement in hearing outcomes following revision OCR and identify prognostic factors for successful revision OCRs.DESIGN: Retrospective review at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 2003 to 2014.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Pediatric patients undergoing multiple OCRs who had demographic, operative, and pre- and postoperative audiogram data. Patients included in our study had >= 2 OCR procedures to the same ear. Forty-three of 123 patients met inclusion criteria.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative audiograms were used to compare the changes in pure-tone averages (PTA), speech recognition thresholds, and air-bone gaps following OCR surgeries.RESULTS: Revision OCRs significantly improved PTA, speech recognition thresholds, and air-bone gaps (p values= 0.003, 0.004, 0.005, respectively) and seven patients (14%) had return of normal hearing (PTA < 25 dB). Cholesteatoma at the time of first revision was associated with additional OCR revisions (hazard ratio [HR]: 10.3; p=0.013), while patients who had canal wall down or no mastoidectomy during first OCR revision were less likely to require additional revision compared with patients who had canal wall up mastoidectomy (HR: 0.170, p = 0.041 versus canal wall down; HR: 0.242, p = 0.041 versus no mastoidectomy).CONCLUSIONS: Revision OCR(s) are an acceptable method to improve residual conductive hearing loss following primary OCR surgery in pediatric patients. Patients with cholesteatoma and canal wall up at the time of revision OCR have increased chances of requiring further revision.

T1  - Anatomical and frequencies-specific hearing results of retrograde mastoidectomy
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term anatomical and frequency-specific hearing results of canal wall down (CWD) and canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy by retrograde mastoidectomy (RM) surgical method.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent CWU and CWD procedures with method of RM, 53 and 59 patients between January 2010 and June 2015 were evaluated retrospectively. The pre- and post-operative pure tone average air-bone gap (ABG) values of these patients were recorded in detail at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4kHz. Pre and post-operative ABG were evaluated in detail in each group in each frequency. In addition, at least two years follow-up recurrence rates were evaluated.RESULTS: In the CWU method, post-operative ABG decreased significantly at low-frequencies compared to pre-operative ABG (p<0.05), especially at 2kHz (p<0.001). But, auditory improvement was not achieved at 4kHz. In the CWD procedure, auditory improvement was not achieved both 1kHz and 4kHz. CWU and CWD recurrence rates were respectively 9.4% and 10.1%.CONCLUSION: Postoperative hearing results of both surgical methods provide good auditory outcome at low-frequencies. This improvement is evident in CWU especially at 2kHz. This may be related to the protection of the external ear canal. In both surgical methods of RM, a satisfactory anatomical success was achieved with recurrence rates of around 10%. RM is a good surgical technique alternative to classical canal wall down procedure with both auditory results and low recurrence rates. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy for Cholesteatoma in Children: Audiometric Results
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the audiometric outcomes of tympanomastoidectomy in children with cholesteatoma and to evaluate factors that may affect outcomes.METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. All pediatric patients diagnosed with cholesteatoma who underwent primary canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy with or without ossicular reconstruction from 2009 to 2016 at a tertiary university-affiliated pediatric medical center were included. Pure tone average (PTA) and air-bone gap (ABG) at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were compared before and after surgery.RESULTS: The cohort included 100 children (104 tympanomastoidectomies) of mean age 10.35 +/- 3.6 years. The mean duration of follow-up was 35.4 +/- 24.1 months. At surgery, 22 patients (21.2%) had intact ossicular chains, and 82 (78.8%) had ossicular discontinuity. Fifty-three patients (51%) underwent ossicular reconstruction, either partial (34 patients [64.1%]) or total (19 patients [35.8%]). In comparison with preoperative audiometry, there was a statistically significant improvement in PTA-ABG at the first postoperative examination (27.5 +/- 12.7 vs 21.1 +/- 11.1 dB, P = .001) and at the end of follow-up (20.2 +/- 12.7 dB, P = .003) . Overall, values of less than 20 dB were measured in 34% of patients preoperatively and 73% postoperatively. On subgroup analysis, in patients who underwent any ossicular reconstruction, PTA-ABG was significantly improved relative to the preoperative value (28.1 +/- 14.7 dB) at both the first (19.1 +/- 11.9 dB, P = .006) and last (22.4 +/- 15.1 dB, P = .011) audiometry examinations.CONCLUSIONS: Hearing outcomes after pediatric cholesteatoma surgery are diverse and related to several factors. The authors found that ossicular reconstruction improves audiometric outcomes, and the changes remain stable over time.Level of evidence: iib.

T1  - Single-Stage Mastoid Obliteration in Cholesteatoma Surgery and Recurrent and Residual Disease Rates: A Systematic Review
AB  - Importance: The ideal surgical treatment of cholesteatoma has been subject to discussion for years because both traditional surgical techniques (canal wall down [CWD] and canal wall up [CWU] tympanoplasty) have their own advantages and disadvantages. A more recently propagated surgical approach, to combine the CWD or CWU tympanoplasty technique with obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanum, is showing promising results.Objective: To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates after single-stage CWU and CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration.Evidence Review: A systematic search of literature was performed to identify relevant publications in multiple electronic databases. The initial search was conducted in December 2016 and was updated in July 2017. Each study was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers on predetermined eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was determined using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale, and the relevance to the current topic was determined using a 4-criterion checklist.Findings: The searches identified a total of 336 potentially relevant publications; 190 articles were excluded based on title and abstract. The full-text articles of the remaining 146 citations were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 22 articles. After assessing these remaining articles for methodological quality and relevance to the current topic, another 8 studies were excluded, and a total of 13 studies (1534 patients) were included. Of the 1534 patients who underwent CWD or CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, the rate of recurrent disease was 4.6%, and the rate of residual disease was 5.4%. In CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, these rates were 0.28% and 4.2%, respectively and in CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, 5.9% and 5.8%, respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: We show the recurrent and residual disease rates after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration to be qualitatively similar to, if not better than, previously reported rates of for nonobliterative techniques. In this study, the lowest recurrent and residual rates were reported when combining the CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, on average 0.28 and 4.2%, respectively.

T1  - Treatment of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain: anatomic and functional results
AB  - SUMMARY: In case of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain, the primary aims of surgery are complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and reconstruction of a dry and safe middle ear; if possible, ossicular chain continuity and therefore the preoperative hearing must be preserved. The aim of this retrospective study is to present the experience of the U.O.C. Otorinolaringoiatria Universitaria of University of Bari "Aldo Moro" in treatment of intact ossicular chain cholesteatoma with Bondy modified radical mastoidectomy (BMRM) and canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT). The study group was composed of 65 subjects affected by cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain. Mean age was 40.7 years (range 6-79), with 42 males and 23 females. 30 patients were treated by a BMRM and 35 by CWUT, in 22 cases without mastoidectomy and in 13 cases with mastoidectomy. Mean follow-up was 24.25 months. In the BMRM group, no cases of residual cholesteatoma located in the middle ear space were detected; at follow-up, 1 patient developed a retraction pocket (3.33%), 1 patient showed a small epidermal cysts of the tympanic membrane (3.33%) and 3 patients (10%) experienced otorrhoea. In CWUT, residual cholesteatoma was detected in 2 cases (5.7%); at follow-up, 3 patients presented recurrent cholesteatoma (8.57%; 2, 6 and 8 years after surgery), 3 cases a retraction pocket (8.57%) and one case otorrhoea (2.86%). Statistical analysis showed a significant higher number of residual cholesteatoma in CWUT (p 0.005) and differences in terms of long-term complications. No significant changes in hearing occurred post-operatively or at 1 year follow-up in either group. The current trend in our centre is to perform BMRM when indicated and CWUT preferably without mastoidectomy in case of mesotympanic cholesteatoma with normal OC.

T1  - Facial canal dehiscence rate: a retrospective analysis of 372 chronic otitis media cases
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the rate and location of facial canal dehiscence (FCD) observed during surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) with or without cholesteatoma.MATERIAL AND METHOD: Operative details of 1296 patients who underwent chronic otitis media surgery from January 2000 to January 2017 by the same surgeon were included in this retrospective study focusing on intraoperative observations of FCD.RESULTS: Because of the type of the surgery, the Fallopian canal could not be seen completely, so 924 of the cases which only involved performing a tympanoplasty were not included in the study. A total of 372 patients (196 males and 176 females) who had a canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy were included in the study. A CWD mastoidectomy was performed on 250 patients, while 122 patients underwent a CWU mastoidectomy. The prevalence of FCD was 11.29% (42/372 patients). The dehiscence was more common in patients with cholesteatoma (n = 37; 88.1%) than those with non-cholesteatoma (n = 5; 11.9%). The tympanic segment (n = 32; 76.19%) was the most common location for FCD. When we compared the ossicular erosion results of the cases that had FCD, erosion in three ossicles together was more statistically significantly frequent than the other possibilities.CONCLUSION: It is possible to see FCD because of COM, especially with cholesteatoma. FCD is most commonly seen around the oval window. If stapes or all three ossicles are eroded, the surgeons must be more careful regarding FCD to be more effective in preventing facial nerve damage.

T1  - Endoscope affects decision making in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of intraoperative otoendoscopy as a factor that could influence surgical decision-making in cholesteatoma surgery.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The material of this study included 82 ears with acquired cholesteatoma that were operated on. They were divided into 4 groups according to the surgical technique chosen and the use of the endoscope. Group I included 22 ears that underwent canal wall-down (CWD) tympanomastoid surgery, group II included 20 ears that underwent CWD tympanomastoid surgery with intraoperative use of endoscopy, group III included 20 ears that underwent canal wall-up (CWU) tympanomastoid surgery, and group IV included 20 ears that underwent CWU tympanomastoid surgery with intraoperative use of endoscopy. Endoscopy was used as a complementary tool to microscopy. The follow-up period ranged from 12 to 48 months.RESULTS: Intraoperative remnants of cholesteatoma matrix were detected during both CWU and CWD by the use of the rigid endoscope. However, its incidence was higher in the CWU group (50%) than in the CWD (30%) group. Most of these remnants were in the sinus tympani (37.5%). The mean duration of follow-up was 18.19 (+/-8.7) months. Postoperative residual cholesteatoma was much higher in the CWU group (25%) than in the CWD group (5%). All residuals were from groups of patients in whom intraoperative endoscopy was not used in the primary surgery.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the use of the endoscope gave the surgeon better control over the pathology, thus achieving better eradication. Stated differently, the use of the endoscope raised the surgeon's confidence level about total removal and thus encouraged the surgeon to keep the canal wall intact while removing cholesteatoma in hidden areas. Therefore, the use of endoscope could be considered an additional tool that may affect decision-making in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Recent outcome of tympanoplasty in the elderly
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the outcome of tympanoplasty in the elderly (patients older than 60 years) compared with younger patients.PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of 87 (28.3%) older patients among a total of 307 patients with chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma who were surgically treated at a university hospital by the senior author. Follow-up was systematically provided at the same institution.INTERVENTIONS: Surgery included tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy performed as the primary procedure in 358 ears. Tympanoplasty was performed with canal-wall-up or canal-wall-down with canal wall reconstruction, ossiculoplasty with autologous or homologous ossicle interposition or columella. Mean follow-up was 30 months (range, 12-70 months).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative air- and bone-conduction thresholds were calculated as an average of three speech frequencies (0.5, 1, and 2 kHz). Analysis was subsequently carried out on the postoperative air-bone gap, hearing gain, and postoperative problems such as elevation of the bone-conduction threshold, delayed epithelialization, and reperforation of the eardrum. Statistical analysis was performed by chi-square or Student's t-test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTS: Compared with results from younger patients, there was no particular disadvantage in postoperative hearing results and complications in the elderly, although preoperative bone-conduction thresholds were gradually worsened with age.CONCLUSIONS: There is no contraindication for tympanoplasty in older patients if their physical status is the same or better than what is normal for their chronological age.

T1  - Mastoid obliteration with hydroxyapatite--the value of high resolution CT scanning in detecting recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Mastoid obliteration carries a risk of enclosing cholesteatoma within the mastoid cavity. Using temporal bones obliterated with either muscle or hydroxyapatite granules, the value of high resolution CT scanning in the early detection of 'epithelial pearls' was studied. The results showed that scanning was effective in detecting small epithelial pearls within the cavity obliterated with hydroxyapatite, but not so effective when muscle was used. This is explained by the difference in the CT density between epidermoid cysts and hydroxyapatite allowing the cysts (dark shadows) to be identified easily within a white background. The authors also studied scans performed on 31 ears following mastoid obliteration with hydroxyapatite. There was no residual cholesteatoma in the obliterated area but there was an area of abnormality identified within the obliterated area in one patient due to a cholesterol granuloma.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: a comparison of closed and open techniques in a follow-up of 164 ears
AB  - In the Malmo community (230,000 inhabitants) 188 ears with cholesteatoma were operated on during 1975-1981. This number corresponds to an incidence of 12 cholesteatomas per 100,000 inhabitants a year. A detailed follow-up was possible in 164 ears. The primary operation was performed with an intact canal wall technique (CAT) in 148 ears and a radical operation in 40 ears. A planned second look was performed in 138 of the CAT ears and residual cholesteatoma was found in 41 or 30%, mainly in the epitympanic space. An initially good healing and hearing result was obtained in 71% but in the course of time several ears developed new retractions and a new mastoid cholesteatoma. The number of ears with perfect hearing tended to decrease with time, but about one-third of CAT ears remained intact with good hearing. The CAT technique is preferable in ears with a large mastoid air cell system and when the cholesteatoma is easily accessible by the approach. A planned second look should be performed including ossiculoplasty and obliteration of the antrum. In the remaining cases a radical operation including middle ear reconstruction and obliteration of the mastoid cavity is preferred.

T1  - Surgery for chronic ear disease in a non-university hospital: open cavity, obliteration and intact canal wall techniques
AB  - The long-term results of surgery for chronic suppurative middle ear disease at a non-university ENT-clinic (Vasa Central Hospital, Finland) are reported. The material consisted of 273 ears, 65 of which had been operated on by open cavity techniques, 178 by the original Palva obliteration method, and 30 by the intact canal wall method. Post-operative cholesteatoma occurred equally frequently with the two canal wall down methods (7.7 and 7.3%, respectively) but was more frequent after intact canal wall surgery (23.3%). Hearing was better and the infection rate lower with obliteration than with open cavity techniques. Post-operative infection was the least frequent and the hearing result best in the intact canal wall ears, but compared to the other two groups the extent of disease found at surgery was considerably less in this group. The obliteration operation proved to be a safe method in the hands of a practising otologist outside university clinics.

T1  - One-stage revision surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma: long-term results and comparison with primary surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies report on revision surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma, even if most studies of primary surgery show high recurrence rates. We present independently evaluated long-term results of revision surgery and compare the results with those of primary surgery.METHODS: The series consisted of 42 consecutive pediatric (age <16 years) cholesteatoma revision operations in the Helsinki University ENT Department. The primary and revision surgery was non-staged, all mastoids were obliterated and the bony ear canals were reconstructed. The preoperative, surgical and annual control data were recorded in a database. The last control was independently performed (J.S.) with an average follow-up of 4.3 years and 87% attendance.RESULTS: The recurrence rate for revision operations was 38%. A retraction process developed in 38% of the ears and 67% of these retractions turned into active cholesteatomas. There was a non-significant difference for these figures as compared with primary surgery. Postoperative discharge and poor middle ear ventilation were associated with recurrence. The following factors showed significant differences between primary and revision surgery: increased number of bare facial nerve in the revision group, lower recurrence rate for experienced surgeons (as for both groups together) and improved hearing results for ears without recurrence in the revision group.CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent disease after revision surgery appears either in the attic or in the mesotympanum, or develops from a retraction pocket in a similar manner as was seen in patients receiving primary surgery. Recurrence is associated with discharging and poorly ventilated ears. Pediatric cholesteatoma surgery should be done or be supervised by experienced surgeons. The present operation methods result in many recurrences after primary and revision surgery. New surgical methods are needed to create additional aeration pathways to the epitympanum in order to improve middle ear aeration and to prevent some of the retractions.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: techniques and results
AB  - A retrospective analysis of the medical records of all cases of cholesteatoma in children treated between 1981 and 1996 was performed. The charts of 59 children with cholesteatoma were reviewed. A total of 62 ears received surgery over 15 years. The median follow-up period was 5 years. There were 132 operations. An intact canal wall (ICW) procedure was performed in 29% of the ears in the first stage, a canal wall down (CWD) procedure in 37%, a transmeatal atticotomy (TA) in 21%, a tympanoplasty (T) in 6.5% and a myringoplasty (M) in 6.5% of the ears. The ICW procedure had a higher rate of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma than did CWD (P=0.8), TA (P=0.4), T (P=0.5), and M (P=0.05). The CWD procedure had a lower rate than TA (P=0.7), but a higher rate than T (P=0.6) and M (P=0.09). Lastly, TA had a higher rate than T (P=0.7) and M (P=0.1). Auditory results were similar for type II and type III reconstructions (P=0.5). An air-bone gap of less than 20 dB was achieved in 51% of the ears, and 80% had a gap of less than 40 dB. We found a clear difference, although not statistically significant, in the personal rate of recurrent cholesteatoma. It was 26% for surgeons who had performed more than 350 otological surgeries and fell to 15% for the most-experienced surgeon (1715 operations). It rose to 34% for the less experienced surgeons (P=0.8). We recommend that surgery for children with cholesteatoma be reserved for experienced surgeons.

T1  - Long-term results of surgery for childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - The study includes 54 cholesteatomatous ears in 50 children aged 16 years or less. The mean follow-up period after surgery was 7.1 years. In 26% of the ears the cholesteatoma was 'huge' involving the middle ear and the attic and filling the entire mastoid air cell system. A patient had lateral sinus thrombophlebitis. Patients with large cholesteatomas underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty and, in most cases, cavity obliteration. Limited cholesteatomas were removed using either intact canal wall mastoidectomy or tympanotomy approach. Recurrence rate (including both residual and recurrent cholesteatomas) for the total series was 15% and 12% for the 50 cases undergoing one-stage surgery. Serviceable hearing (< or = 30 dB) was achieved in 57% of the ears. A reoperation was necessary in 26% and a third operation in 2%. At last follow-up examination, 94% of the ears had intact tympanic membranes but 4 patients (8%) suffered from cavity-related problems. Possible reasons for the disappointing results of surgical treatment for childhood cholesteatoma are discussed.

T1  - [Surgical evaluation and clinical features of cholesteatoma in children]
AB  - There are two types of cholesteatoma in children, congenital and acquired. The pathogenesis of each type is thought to be different. The pathogenesis of congenital cholesteatoma is thought to be the embryonic inclusion of squamous epithelium, whereas acquired cholesteatoma is thought to develop from various factors including recurrent otitis media and tubal insufficiency. We reviewed a series of 23 patients with congenital cholesteatoma and 27 patients with acquired cholesteatoma, aged 2-15 years, who were operated on at our institution between January 1981 and December 1990. Planned staged surgery was performed in all patients. In the first-stage operation, the canal-wall-up technique was used in all cases. About 12 months after the first operation, the second-stage operation was performed to investigate the course of the disease. The presence of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma was evaluated at this time. In the congenital cholesteatoma series, 11 cases of residual cholesteatoma (48%) were detected at the second-stage operation. Since recurrent cholesteatoma was not observed in the series of congenital cholesteatoma cases, the prognosis of these cases was considered to be good. On the other hand, in the acquired cholesteatoma series, 9 cases (33%) of recurrent cholesteatoma and 13 (48%) of residual cholesteatoma were detected at the second-stage operation. For the second-stage operation, the canal-wall-up technique was performed on 18 patients with no recurrence, whereas the canal-wall-down technique was used on all 9 patients with recurrence. Additional mastoid obliteration was performed on 7 of these 9 patients. The prognosis of the patients who underwent obliteration was good, and there was no recurrence of cholesteatoma after the second operation. From these observations, it was concluded that planned staged tympanoplasty was useful for eliminating recurrent and residual cholesteatoma. It is also apparent that, in order to prevent recurrent cholesteatoma, it is necessary to reduce the air space to compensate for poor eustachian tube ventilation.

T1  - Causes of failure of mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media
AB  - The operative findings of 66 patients who underwent revision mastoid surgery for recurrent chronic otitis media were analyzed for the causes of failure of the primary procedures. Recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 41% of the canal wall down and 70% of the canal wall up procedures requiring revision. Additional causes of failure included granulation tissue in unexenterated cells, particularly in the tegmental cells (41% of all cases and 64% of cases without cholesteatoma) and cells of the sinodural angle (38% of all cases and 58% of cases without cholesteatoma). The need for thorough exenteration of cells, particularly the tegmental cells and cells of the sinodural angle, mastoid tip, and facial recess, and the importance of lowering the facial ridge in canal wall down procedures were stressed. Following these principles, the success rate in creating a dry ear in 48 patients who had undergone from one to three previous mastoid procedures was 85% (mean follow-up three years).

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: the influence of the canal wall
AB  - Although there is an increasing awareness of the risks of complications following intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) for cholesteatoma, long-term evidence to support a preference for alternative techniques in which the canal wall having been removed, the resultant cavity is obliterated, is comparatively scarce. In order to clarify this uncertainty, long-term results with both operations have been analyzed to determine incidence rates for postoperative complications and functional results. Recurrent cholesteatoma (retraction pocket) has occurred in 14% of ICWT ears and 1% of ears with mastoid obliteration and tympanic reconstruction. The incidence of clinically detected residual disease with both operations has been extremely low so far, in spite of greater than 20% incidence of epithelial pearls at the second stage of separate planned two-stage procedures with each technique. It is concluded that reduction to the greatest degree possible of cholesteatomatous complications from tympanoplasty necessitates removal of the canal wall.

T1  - Results in resident cholesteatoma surgery: a review of 85 cases
AB  - A review of all patients with cholesteatoma operated on by the residents of the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary under the attending supervision of the Otology Service between 1980 and 1984 was done. Of 130 resident cases, 85 had documented follow-up 1 year or longer and were included in the study. Recurrence rates were 18% with canal wall down (CWD) and 43% with canal wall up (CWU) techniques. Considering other forms of failure (such as precholesteatoma, tympanic membrane perforation, and chronic infection), overall failure rates were 33% (CWD) compared with 82% (CWU). Cholesteatoma recurrence failure rates were higher in patients under the age of 20 (33%) than over the age of 20 (19%). Overall failure rates were 61% and 37% for younger and older patients, respectively. Due to the high failure rate with canal wall up techniques in resident hands, it is recommended that resident service cases be treated with canal wall down technique, especially in the younger age group.

T1  - Treatment of sinus cholesteatoma. Long-term results and recurrence rate
AB  - We classified cholesteatomas as attic cholesteatoma, developing from Shrapnell's membrane; tensa cholesteatoma, originating in pars tensa, which is subdivided into tensa retraction cholesteatoma involving the entire pars tensa, and sinus cholesteatomas, developing from a posterosuperior retraction (perforation). From 1964 to 1980, one-stage operations were carried out on 271 ears with sinus cholesteatomas. Follow-up included 90% of the patients, and the median observation time was 9.75 years. The recurrence rate was 10%. The recurrence rate was found to be independent of the mastoidectomy type employed. The best hearing results were obtained in ears with intact ossicular chain. We conclude that, wherever possible, sinus cholesteatoma should be removed through the auditory canal without mastoidectomy just as an intact ossicular chain should be preserved. "Canal wall up" and "canal wall down" appear to be equally valuable mastoidectomy types, and both methods must be employed to obtain optimum results.

T1  - Predictors of residual-recurrent cholesteatoma in children
AB  - The aggressive nature of childhood cholesteatoma has generated much controversy regarding the optimal management of this challenging disorder. To identify potential predictors of residual-recurrent disease, we studied 232 children (244 ears) treated with 427 surgical procedures between 1973 and 1990. Cause of the primary cholesteatoma was congenital in 43 patients (18%), acquired in 83 (36%), and unknown in 106 (46%). Of 90 patients with residual-recurrent disease, 21 (23%) instances were detected during a second-look surgical exploration. The 3- and 5-year residual-recurrence rates were 48% and 57%, respectively. Development of residual-recurrent disease was associated with ossicular erosion (Cox regression) but not with status of the canal wall (up vs down) during tympanomastoidectomy. This study suggests a need for intense and prolonged postoperative follow-up of children with cholesteatoma, especially those with ossicular erosion.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - The 65 cholesteatomas operated on in children showed a more expansive and rapid growth than those in adults. In one fifth of the cases cholesteatoma filled the whole air-cell area, which was wide in half of the children. Fifty-two ears of these children had an attic or a posterosuperior perforation. One case was complicated by a fistula in the horizontal semicircular canal, and the ossicular chain was unbroken in 23 cases (35%). Thus, the findings support the idea of the primary soft-tissue spread of cholesteatoma in children. Five ears (8%) discharged postoperatively, and three ears (5%) were reoperated on and showed residual tympanal cholesteatoma. Cavity obliteration with canal wall down technique proved safe, even in the cases of the most extensive and active cholesteatoma.

T1  - Extensive cholesteatoma: long-term results of three surgical techniques
AB  - During the years 1979-81, three different surgical techniques were used in the treatment of 87 ears with extensive cholesteatoma. All procedures were performed in one stage by the same surgeon. Ten to 13 years after the operations about 70 per cent of ears operated on by the canal wall up technique had developed a new cholesteatoma, which in most cases was recurrent, or a deep retraction pocket. A modification of this technique with mastoid obliteration resulted in a similar failure rate. In contrast, ears operated on by the canal wall down technique (in most cases with mastoid obliteration) had acceptable stability with a long-term recurrence rate of about 15 per cent. Most patients in the canal wall down group had a dry ear without significant cavity problems. Hearing in these patients was as least as good as hearing in patients with a preserved canal wall. We conclude that a meticulous one-stage canal wall down technique in ears with extensive cholesteatoma results in a high percentage of unproblematic, stable ears with satisfactory function. In contrast, if the posterior canal wall is preserved, recurrent cholestealoma is the rule more than the exception.

T1  - Tensa retraction cholesteatoma: treatment and long-term results
AB  - To obtain the best possible results of treatment of acquired cholesteatoma, we made a subdivision of cholesteatoma types into attic and pars tensa cholesteatomas, and subdivided the latter further into tensa retraction cholesteatoma and sinus cholesteatomas. Tensa retraction cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the whole pars tensa, whereas sinus cholesteatoma is defined as arising from a retraction or perforation of the postero-superior part of the tensa. We present the long-term results obtained in tensa retraction cholesteatomas treated with one stage surgery from 1964 to 1980. Median observation time was 9 years, range 2 to 19 years. Sixty-one ears were treated without mastoidectomy, whereas 71 ears had canal wall-up mastoidectomy and 64 ears had canal wall-down mastoidectomy. The total recurrence rate was 13.3 per cent; 17 ears had residual cholesteatoma, and nine ears had recurrent cholesteatoma. The best results were obtained in ears with an intact ossicular chain where mastoidectomy was not performed. In 49 per cent of the cases, the cholesteatoma was confined to the tympanic cavity without reaching the aditus, antrum or mastoid process. About one-third to one-quarter of the ears had tympanoplasty only, with removal of the cholesteatoma through the ear canal.

T1  - Surgical treatment of chronic middle ear disease. II. Canal wall up and canal wall down procedures
AB  - Results of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoid one-stage surgery were evaluated in 268 ears. In the CWU group of 121 ears, 50 ears (41%) had clinical cholesteatoma, whereas cholesteatoma was present in all 147 ears operated upon by the CWD technique. The disease was much less severe in the former group, which, for instance, showed no labyrith fistula, as compared with 17 (12%) in the latter group. Extensive disease also accounts for the larger number of complications seen in the CWD group. Average hearing levels postoperatively in the CWU group were significantly better than preoperatively. In the CWD group the preoperative levels were maintained. Recurrence of cholesteatoma was noted in 2% in the CWD group, while one implantation cholesteatoma occurred in the CWU group. Of the many surgical procedures available, the one offering the best means of curing the disease should of course be chosen. Ossicular repair with bone offers good prospects of a successful one-stage reconstruction.

T1  - Surgical treatment of chronic middle ear disease. III. Revisions after tympanomastoid surgery
AB  - Revision surgery was performed in 185 ears which had earlier undergone a total of 276 tympanomastoid operations. An open cavity had been made in 98, obliteration in 44 and canal wall up surgery in 43 ears. All ears were now operated upon by the open method combined with ear canal reconstruction and mastoid obliteration. Mastoid cholesteatoma was found in 50% of the open cavities and in 63% of intact canal wall ears, while 80% of the obliterated ears showed mastoid retraction pockets with cholesteatoma. Semicircular canal fistulae occurred in all groups, most frequently in open cavities (11%). During the follow-up period after revision (average 5 years) 3% were reoperated upon because of a new cholesteatoma. In the whole series, average hearing levels were slightly better postoperatively and in 34% of the ears the A-B gap was 20 dB at most. The main reason for failure after primary surgery was inadequate mastoid and epitympanic bone work and failure to obliterate the medial parts of the cavity thoroughly.

T1  - Residual cholesteatoma revealed by endoscopy after microsurgery
AB  - Residual cholesteatoma revealed by endoscopy after microsurgery.OBJECTIVE: To endoscopically examine common sites of residual cholesteatoma occurrence after microscopic ear surgery.METHODS: Thirty patients (15 men and 15 women; age range: 7-81 years) who underwent treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma (20 patients with pars flaccida :holesteatoma and 10 patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma) were selected. Following the removal of the cholesteatoma matrix via microscopy, residual matrix presence was assessed using an endoscope system. Additional resection was performed if the residual matrix was detected. Sites of residual matrix and their rates of incidence were then investigated.RESULTS: Residual matrix was observed in nine out of the 30 (30%) patients by endoscopy after microscopic surgery. Residual matrix was observed in eight out of the 20 (40%) patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma and in one out of :he 10 (10%) patients with pars tensa cholesteatoma. Residual matrix was observed in six out of the 14 (43%) patients who underwent canal wall up (CWU) tympanomastoidectomy and in three out of the 13 (23%) patients who underwent -anal wall down (CWD) tympanomastoidectomy. Sites of residual matrix included the tegmen tympani in two patients, he medial scutal surface in three patients, the tympanic sinus in two patients and the anterior epitympanic recess in three patients. The risk of residual matrix was greater in patients with pars flaccida cholesteatoma than in those with pars tensa :holesteatoma. The attic, tympanic sinus and anterior epitympanic recess are common sites of residual cholesteatoma.CONCLUSION: Endoscopy is advantageous for the assessment of residual cholesteatoma in hidden areas.

T1  - [Clinical characteristics in children with cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma]
AB  - Objective: To summarize the characteristics of children diagnosed as cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma. Methods: There were five middle ear cholesteatoma cases who had previously received cleft palate repairment surgery. All of the patients were followed up for 17 to 47 months. Median follow-up time was 31 months. Results: There were three males and two females with three to eleven years old , and the average of age was seven years and ten months. The time of cleft palate repairment surgery was from six months to four years, and the average age was one year and nine months. No history of grommet insertion. Three cases were unilateral choleateatoma (right ear in two cases and left ear in one case, of which two cases of contralateral ear with secretory otitis media) and two cases were bilateral choleateatoma. Five cases(seven ears) received surgeries. Radical mastoidectomy + canal wall down tympanoplasty were performed in three ears, in which we found stapes disappeared. Radical mastoidectomy + canal wall up tympanoplasty were performed in four ears, in which we found intact foot plate, with recurrence occurred in one case nine months after the first surgery. No recurrence occurred after the second canal wall down tympanoplasty. The postoperative average hearing thresholds of air conduction were improved in different degrees. Conclusions: There may be a relationship between cleft palate associated with middle ear cholesteatoma and no grommet insertion history. The incidence of bilateral cases is relatively high, and otitis media with effusion may occur because of poor Eustachian tube function in the unilateral cases. Choice of surgical methods should be decided basing on combination of decreasing the recrudescence and improving the hearing.

T1  - Significance of intraoperative findings in revision tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - PURPOSE: The study was designed to assess correlations between intraoperative findings in revision tympanomastoidectomy as predictors of cholesteatoma recurrence.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-institution cohort of 101 patients who underwent surgical treatment for recurrent chronic otitis media in a tertiary referral otology centre.RESULTS: Out of 101 patients, 65 had canal wall up and 36 canal wall down revision surgery. There were 35 cholesteatoma recurrences. Sites most commonly associated with recurrent disease were residual facial ridge cells in 46 (45.5%), ossicular chain sites in 46 (45.5%) patients, posterior external auditory canal wall erosions in 38 (37.6%) patients and mastoid apex recurrence in 35 (34.7%) patients. Ossicular and posterior external auditory canal wall erosion and incomplete removal of mastoid apex cells correlate well with cholesteatoma recurrence accompanied by canal wall up surgery (p=0.009). Residual mastoid apex cells, posterior external auditory canal wall erosion and presence of residual facial ridge cells were identified as the strongest positive predictors of cholesteatoma recurrence, identifying high risk patients associated with canal wall down procedures (p=0.0036).CONCLUSIONS: Correlations between intraoperative findings and cholesteatoma recurrence could improve preoperative and intraoperative planning and reduce the rates of postoperative failures1 due to mismanagement of high risk areas.

T1  - Mastoid Obliteration with Autologous Bone in Mastoidectomy Canal Wall Down Surgery: a Literature Overview
AB  - Introduction The objectives of mastoidectomy in cholesteatoma are a disease-free and dry ear, the prevention of recurrent disease, and the maintenance of hearing or the possibility to reconstruct an affected hearing mechanism. Canal wall down mastoidectomy has been traditionally used to achieve those goals with greater or lesser degrees of success. However, canal wall down is an aggressive approach, as it involves creating an open cavity and changing the anatomy and physiology of the middle ear and mastoid. A canal wall up technique eliminates the need to destroy the middle ear and mastoid, but is associated with a higher rate of residual cholesteatoma. The obliteration technics arise as an effort to avoid the disadvantages of both techniques. Objective s Evaluate the effectiveness of the mastoid obliteration with autologous bone in mastoidectomy surgery with canal wall down for chronic otitis, with or without cholesteatoma. Data Synthesis We analyzed nine studies of case series comprehending similar surgery techniques on 1017 total cases of operated ears in both adults and children, with at least 12 months follow-up. Conclusion Mastoid Obliteration with autologous bone has been utilized for many years to present date, and it seems to be safe, low-cost, with low recurrence rates - similar to traditional canal wall down procedures and with greater water resistance and quality of life improvements.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Comparison between canal wall-down and canal wall-up techniques in surgery for chronic otitis media
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic otitis media (COM) is an inflammatory condition associated with otorrhea as well as large and persistent perforations of the tympanic membrane in some cases. COM can also lead to cholesteatoma. Surgical treatment with canal wall-down and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is considered for both types of illness. The choice of technique is controversial and is dependent on several factors, including the extent of disease.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes in COM patients with and without cholesteatoma treated with canal wall-down and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Disease eradication and post-operative auditory thresholds were assessed.METHOD: Patient records from the otorhinolaryngology department of a tertiary hospital were assessed retrospectively.RESULTS: Patients who underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy had a higher rate of revision surgery, especially those with cholesteatoma. However, there were no statistically significant differences in post-operative hearing thresholds between the two techniques.CONCLUSION: The canal wall-down technique is superior to the canal wall-up technique, especially for patients with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Clinical Significance of beta-Tricalcium Phosphate and Polyphosphate for Mastoid Cavity Obliteration during Middle Ear Surgery: Human and Animal Study
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mastoid obliteration is used to obliterate the mastoid cavity following a mastoidectomy or to prevent the formation of a retraction pocket. This study evaluated the effectiveness of beta-tricalcium phosphate and polyphosphate (beta-TPP) for mastoid obliteration in middle ear surgeries in prospective human and animal studies.METHODS: Twenty patients with chronic otitis media underwent mastoid obliteration using beta-TPP after a intact canal wall mastoidectomy or simple mastoidectomy. The clinical data were prospectively evaluated including: the diagnosis, temporal bone computed tomography (TBCT), otoscopic findings, pure tone audiogram, and complications. In the animal experiment, beta-TPP was applied into the right bulla in five rats, and the opposite bulla was used as the control in the non-obliterated state. The skulls of five other rats were drilled out and the holes were obliterated with beta-TPP. TBCT were obtained at 3, 6, and 9 months after the obliteration and histologic analysis was done at 3 and 9 months after surgery.RESULTS: In the human study, fourteen TBCTs were obtained at 12 months after the surgery. All demonstrated no bone resorption in the obliterated mastoids. Among the 15 cases displaying retracted tympanic membranes preoperatively, 11 showed no retraction, 2 showed retraction postoperatively, 1 was lost to follow-up and 1 was a case of postoperative wound infection. Among 20 cases, one case developed a postoperative infection that necessitated a second operation. Sixteen underwent ossiculoplasty; hearing improvements were obtained in 15 cases and 1 case showed decreased hearing. In the animal study, new bone formation without significant bone resorption in the radiologic and histologic findings were noted in both the skull and bulla groups.CONCLUSION: Although beta-TPP is a foreign material having the possibility of infection, mastoid obliteration with it can be a treatment option in middle ear surgeries to prevent retraction pockets or the recurrence of diseases.

T1  - Chronic suppurative otitis media following paediatric cochlear implantation
AB  - The objective of this study was to report and discuss the management of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) following cochlear implantation in children. The study was a retrospective review of 650 patients receiving an implant at two paediatric tertiary referral centres for cochlear implantation. Nine patients were identified who developed CSOM following cochlear implantation (incidence 1.38%). The mean time interval between implantation and symptom development was 3.66 years (range 2-8 years) and the mean time interval between implantation and CSOM surgery was 5.02 years (range 2.2-8 years). All patients presented with otorrhoea and/or abscess formation over the implant site. Two patients underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy and seven underwent a combined approach tympanoplasty, three of whom required posterior canal wall reconstruction with cortical bone and one with cartilage. In four cases it was possible to remove the cholesteatoma without removing the implant. All but two patients were fitted with a contralateral implant. In the explanted ears the cochlear implant electrode was cut at the cochleostomy site, which was then covered with muscle. Chronic suppurative otitis media following cochlear implantation may occur either as a result of a posterior canal wall defect related to surgery or possibly de novo. Attempts should be made to save the implant, but explantation with reimplantation of the contralateral ear may be the only option. In these cases the intracochlear part of the electrode array should be left in situ to facilitate possible future reimplantation. Surgical options for management of CSOM should be individualized and may include both canal-wall up and canal-wall down techniques. To reduce the incidence of CSOM following implantation the authors recommend: (1) prompt treatment and careful follow-up of patients with a history of otitis media with effusion, (2) avoidance of excessive thinning of the posterior canal wall during mastoidectomy and (3) reconstruction of any accidental trauma to the annulus or posterior canal wall during posterior tympanotomy.

T1  - Recidivous cholesteatoma: DWI MR after canal wall up and canal wall down mastoidectomy
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between preoperative non-echo planar diffusion-weighted (non-EPI DWI) MR imaging with surgical findings of recidivous middle ear cholesteatoma after canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy.BACKGROUND: The detection of recidive cholesteatoma after CWU and after CWD procedures, when the trepanation cavity is spontaneously closed by soft tissue, is possible by second-look and revision surgery. However, many cases prove to be negative of the disease. To avoid unnecessary operational risks we adopted a novel imaging method to evaluate its potential in the detection of recidivous cholesteatoma.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The prospective study included 27 cases. Fifteen cases were revised after CWD and 12 cases were second-look surgeries after CWU procedures. All patients underwent the MR protocol: T2-weighted, T1-weighted and non-EPI DWI. The finding on MR correlated with peroperative presence of cholesteatoma.RESULTS: Non-EPI DWI sequence showed an increased signal intensity in 16/27 (59 %) cases. This correlated with surgical findings in all 7 patients after CWU and in 8 patients after CWD. The overall sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of non-EPI DWI were 83.3 %, 88.8 %, 93.8 % and 72.7 %, respectively. DWI presented a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 85.7 % in the subgroup of patients after CWD mastoidectomy.CONCLUSION: Residual and/or recurrent cholesteatoma can be accurately detected by DWI MR. It can be used as a screening method to select patients, who are indicated to second-look or revision surgery after CWU and CWD mastoidectomy (Tab. 1, Fig. 3, Ref. 49).

T1  - [Analyses of the operative efficacy of 102 cases of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of operations of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma.METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 102 patients whom received tympanoplasty with CWU or CWD with mastoid obliteration in our hospital between January 2014 and December 2014. Patients were divided into different groups according to types of the cholesteatoma as well as the different surgical procedures. Patients were followed up for 12-24 months, the pre and post-operative PTA was performed and evaluated. The post-operative hearing was assessed in terms of average ABG.RESULTS: The average dry ear time was (5.4+/-1.7)weeks. The dry ear time of patients of attic cholesteatoma was shorter than those of tensa cholesteatoma[(4.9+/-1.7)weeks vs(6.1+/-1.5)weeks, t=-3.52, P=0.001]; the dry ear time of patients underwent CWU was shorter than those underwent CWD with mastoid obliteration[(2.3+/-0.5)weeks vs(5.8+/-1.4)weeks, t=-8.43, P=0.000]. Mean pre and post-operative air bone gaps in 93 ears underwent ossiculoplasty were (34.2+/-11.8)dB and (19.0+/-5.5)dB respectively and these differences were statistically significant. Both the pre and post-operative air bone gaps of ears of attic cholesteatoma were smaller than those ears of tensa cholesteatoma(P<0.05). In the patients who underwent ossiculoplasty with CWD with mastoid obliteration, the post-operative air bone gaps of attic cholesteatoma were smaller than those of tensa cholesteatoma(P<0.05). Both the pre and post-operative air bone gaps of ears underwent CWU were smaller than those underwent CWD with mastoid obliteration(P<0.05). The post-operative air bone gaps of ears underwent PORP with CWD with mastoid obliteration were smaller than those underwent TORP with CWD with mastoid obliteration(P<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Both the hearing loss and the outcome of tensa cholesteatoma are worser than attic cholesteatoma. The outcome of PORP is better than TORP. The patients who will accept CWU should be selected more carefully and be followed up regularly.

T1  - Cost analysis and outcomes of a second-look tympanoplasty-mastoidectomy strategy for cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To analyze cost and compare cholesteatoma recidivism and hearing outcomes with single-stage and second-look operative strategies.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review and cost analysis.METHODS: Adult and pediatric patients who underwent a tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma with a single-stage or second-look operative strategy were identified. Variables included procedure approach, residual or recurrent cholesteatoma, ossicular chain reconstruction frequency, and operative complications. Audiologic outcomes included pre-/postoperative air bone gap (ABG) and word recognition score (WRS). Cost analysis included charges for consultation and follow-up visits, surgical procedures, computed tomography temporal bone scans, and audiology visits.RESULTS: One hundred and six patients had a tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma, with 80 canal wall-up procedures (CWU) as initial approach. Of these, 46 (57.5%) CWU patients had a planned second look. Two (4.3%) CWU patients had recurrent cholesteatoma and 20 (43.4%) had residual identified at second look. Four (11.7%) single-stage CWU strategy patients developed recurrent cholesteatoma. There was no significant difference in pre-/postoperative ABG and WRS between second look and single stage (P > 0.05). Compared to second-look patients, single-stage patients had significantly fewer postoperative visits (6.32 vs. 10.4; P = 0.007), and significantly lower overall charges for care ($23,529. vs. $41.411; P < 0.0001).CONCLUSION: The goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to produce a safe ear, and a second-look strategy after CWU has historically been used to evaluate for recurrent or residual disease. The cholesteatoma recurrence rate at a second look after a CWU tympanoplasty-mastoidectomy is low. Costs of operative procedures are a significant proportion of healthcare resource expenditures. Considering the low rate of cholesteatoma recurrence and relatively high cost of care, implementation of a second-look strategy should be individually tailored and not universally performed.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

T1  - A retrospective study on post-operative hearing of middle ear cholesteatoma patients with labyrinthine fistula
AB  - CONCLUSIONS: There is no significant change in bone conduction threshold after operation, so the tympanoplasty can be done to maintain hearing when conditions allow.OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of surgical treatment on hearing of cholesteatoma patients with labyrinthine fistula.METHODS: The clinical data of 35 patients (35 ears) with labyrinthine fistula, which were caused by cholesteatoma, were analyzed retrospectively. The hearing of 21 patients was followed up.RESULTS: Three months to 5 years follow-up of 21 patients were accomplished by pure tone audiometry and other details. There was no recurrent cholesteatoma in the patients. Compared with pre-operative average bone conduction at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz, 12 cases had a difference less than 5 dB, three patients' hearing improved (more than 10 dB), and five cases declined (more than 10 dB). One patient received cochlear implantation 3 months after the surgery. The average bone and air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz had no obvious change (p > 0.05) in 11 patients managed by a canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty.

T1  - [Our surgical treatment results in pediatric cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate surgical techniques and obtained outcomes in pediatric cholesteatoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 62 patients (41 males, 21 females; mean age 13 years; range 3 to 17 years) diagnosed as pediatric cholesteatoma between January 1998 and December 2014 were enrolled into the study. Of the patients, canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy was performed in 31, canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy in 13, inside-out (ISO) mastoidectomy in eight, and tympanoplasty in 10. Surgical approaches, staging, hearing outcomes, relapse status, and surgical data were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Cholesteatoma recurred in seven patients (11%). Recurrence rates for CWU and CWD mastoidectomies were 31% and 6%, respectively. While the number of patients with good serviceable hearing (pure-tone average >=25 dB) was 10 preoperatively, it became 16 postoperatively. Ossicular erosion was higher in CWD group. Twenty-nine patients (47%) had extensive disease and CWD mastoidectomy was performed in 86% of these. Number of patients not requiring care was 45 (72.6%).CONCLUSION: In this study, we observed no differences in terms of good serviceable hearing between CWU and CWD mastoidectomies. The preferred method was mainly CWD in patients with extensive disease and ossicular erosion. Recurrence rates were higher in CWU group. Therefore, ISO or CWD mastoidectomy come to the forefront as appropriate treatment options in the treatment of pediatric cholesteatomas according to the extensiveness of disease.

T1  - Long-term surgical and functional outcomes of the intact canal wall technique for middle ear cholesteatoma in the paediatric population
AB  - In this paper, we report the postoperative outcomes in canal wall up procedures with second stage surgery in 40 children undergoing intervention for cholesteatoma of the middle ear. The residuals, recurrences and the hearing results were analysed. All 40 patients had a follow-up of at least five years. Of the 39 patients who underwent two staged surgery, 18 (46.1%) had a residual lesion that was identified and excised during the second surgery. Over a five year follow-up period, there were five (12.5%) patients with recurrences, all belonging to the group in whom a residual cholesteatoma was identified during the second staged surgery. The rate of residual cholesteatoma tends to decrease as age increases. The type of cholesteatoma, acquired or congenital middle ear, were not statistically related to the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Hearing analysis showed that hearing recovery was excellent with canal wall up procedures and remained stable over five years.

T1  - Relationships between facial canal dehiscence and other intraoperative findings in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between facial canal dehiscence and intraoperative middle ear and mastoid findings in patients operated on for cholesteatoma.METHODS: We examined retrospectively 334 patients who had been operated on for cholesteatoma in Izmir Katip Celebi University, Ataturk Research and Training Hospital, ENT Clinic, between April 1997 and April 2010. The patients were examined for facial canal dehiscence according to age, gender, side of the ear, surgery type, first or revision surgery, localization of the facial canal dehiscence, spread of the cholesteatoma, with the presence of lateral semi-circular canal (LSCC) fistula and any defect in the ossicle chain, and destruction in the posterior wall of the external auditory canal(EAC).RESULTS: Of the patients, 23.6% had facial canal dehiscence and detected most commonly in the right ear 28.9% and tympanic segment, 83.5%. Facial canal dehiscence was found to be 24.2-fold more common in patients with LSCC fistula and 4.1-fold more common in patients with destruction in the posterior wall of the (EAC). In patients located cholesteatoma in tympanic cavity+antrum and the tympanic cavity+all mastoid cells and with incus and stapes defect, increased incidence of dehiscence. Age, first or revision operation and canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWDT) or canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT) did not affect the incidence of dehiscence.CONCLUSIONS: That the likelihood of facial canal dehiscence occurrence is increased in patients with LSSC fistulas, destruction in the posterior wall of the EAC, or a stapes defect is important information for surgeons.

T1  - Cholesteatoma recidivism: comparison of three different surgical techniques
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cholesteatoma recidivism rates after exclusive transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal and mastoidal technique (TCM, both subsets of intact canal wall technique, ICW), and canal wall down surgery (CWD).STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review and clinical case studySETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: 406 cholesteatoma surgeries (2007-2009), 116 ears in clinical re-examination at least 1 year postoperatively.INTERVENTION: Sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM, or CWD.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cholesteatoma recidivism, residual and recurrent disease, localization of recidivism, validity of clinical findings.RESULTS: Out of 406 patients, ETC was performed in 227 (56%), TCM in 122 (30%), and CWD in 57 (14%) cases. Recidivism rates after ICW (15%) and CWD (16%) were almost similar. Recidivism was more frequent after ETC (11%) than after TCM (25%). Residuals were observed in 2% after ETC, 6.5% after TCM, and 7% after CWD. Incidence of recurrent disease was 9% for ETC, 18% for TCM, and 9% for CWD. Preferred localization of recidivism was the tympanic cavity after ETC (92%) and CWD (56%) and the mastoid cavity after TCM (53%). The clinical re-examination showed no further recidivistic disease.CONCLUSIONS: Sequential surgery is an effective and successful strategy in cholesteatoma eradication, providing a similar recidivism rate compared to following cholesteatoma retrograde and resection of the posterior canal wall. Lower recidivism after ETC was observed as a consequence of limited disease and the postoperative middle ear status determined the higher rate of recurrence after TCM. Therefore, the restricted visualization of the middle ear during ICW surgery does not increase the rate of recidivism, compared with CWD, as described in other studies. Cholesteatoma recidivism is mainly attributed to the surgeon's experience that outweighs the chosen strategy.

T1  - [Acquired pediatric cholesteatoma: predictive factors of recurrence. A retrospective study of 11 years]
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To define the predictive factors of recurrence of the pediatric acquired cholesteatoma in order to improve the long-term results, to restore a good hearing function and to prevent the complications.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study concerning all cases of pediatric acquired cholesteatoma, treated during the period 1997-2008 in our center, and followed up for at least one year. A description of the parameters concerning the patients, disease and treatment as well as a univariate analysis were undertaken in order to determine the recurrence predictors. The recurrence-free survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: 26 ears were studied and followed over a mean period of 62 months after the first intervention. The mean age was 12 years (11.7 years) with a 2.7 sex-ratio. The main clinical presentations were otorrhea (65%) and hypoacusia in 42% of cases. Fifteen cases (57.7%) presented an extension to the mastoid, 50% of the ears had an ossicular erosion and 11 cholesteatomas revealed a local or regional invasion. Almost 3/4 (73%) of the cholesteatomas were treated using a canal wall up surgery. The cumulative rate of recurrence was 53.8% and the rate of recurrence-free survival was 84%, 56%, and 44.7% at 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. Only the extension of the cholesteatoma to the mastoid, and the local and regional invasion (sinus tympani, lateral semi-circular canal, facial nerve recess, etc.) of the cholesteatoma at diagnosis, showed a significant higher risk of recurrence (p < 0.05).CONCLUSION: In our study, the extent of the disease at diagnosis is considered as the major predictive factor of recurrence in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma population raising the problem of delayed diagnosis.

T1  - Alternative to canal wall-down mastoidectomy for sclerotic mastoid cavities: epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Surgical procedures for chronic ear disease can be grossly divided into two tympanoplasty procedures: canal wall-up and canal wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomies. The choice depends on the surgeon's preference. Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration (EMO) has shown postoperative results similar to those of CWD mastoidectomy with long-term follow-up. In this study, we compared the outcomes of EMO and CWD mastoidectomy in preoperatively sclerotic mastoid cavities with cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media with poor eustachian tube function, or adhesive otitis media. The operations were performed by the same surgeons in order to eliminate any effect of surgeon preference on the surgical outcomes.METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty with EMO (EMO group) or CWD mastoidectomy (CWD group) and followed them for more than 28 months. The postoperative outcomes were analyzed and compared.RESULTS: The EMO and CWD groups comprised 132 and 110 ears, respectively. In both groups, the air-bone gaps were significantly reduced after operation. The relapse rates of the groups were similar. Cavity problems were the most common complication in the CWD group. The overall complication rate in the EMO group was significantly lower than that in the CWD group (p = 0.044).CONCLUSIONS: Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration can be considered an alternative procedure to CWD mastoidectomy in patients with preoperatively sclerotic mastoid cavities. It gives similar surgical results and has fewer complications.

T1  - Management of acquired cholesteatoma in children: a 15 year review in ENT service of CHNU de FANN Dakar
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze the epidemiology, diagnosis, management and the prognosis of cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children.METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 15 years (from 01 January 1995 to 31 December 2009) for patients aged 0-15 years admitted in ENT ward of FANN hospital for chronic otitis media complicated with cholesteatoma The parameters studied were epidemiology, clinical presentation, disease progression and management.RESULTS: Sixty-six participants were included. We noted a slight male predominance with a sex ratio of 1.44. The average mean age was 10 years. Most patients presented with signs of complications (69.7%) and mastoiditis was the most common complication (63.6%). The otorrhea was noted in almost all patients: n = 64 (97%) and deafness in 49 patients (74, 2%). There was a slight predominance of cholesteatoma on the right side (51.5%). Schuller's view of the mastoid cells was done in 21.2% of patients (n = 14) and showed sclerotic mastoid air cells for all them. Eighty-two percent (82%) of patients presented with conductive hearing loss. A radical mastoidectomy was performed in 66.7% and modified radical mastoidectomy in 33.3% of cases. Mean follow-up was 6 months. Recurrence of cholesteatoma was noted in 13% of cases.CONCLUSIONS: ENT ward of Hospital Fann is one of the two centers in Senegal where cholesteatoma of the middle ear are treated. This low number of cholesteatoma in children in a developing country is in relation to the fact that patients only present when complications develop: 70% of cases. The reason for this in our setting include insufficient human and manpower resources necessary for prompt management of the disease and also lack of awareness among the populace. In these settings we advocate canal wall down mastoidectomy (radical or modified radical) as the treatment of choice. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

T1  - [Application of the endoscopy in the middle ear surgery]
AB  - Endoscopy is used in the middle ear surgery for above twenty years when decrease of cholesteatoma recurrence due to employing endoscope was revealed in comparison to standard microscopic only visualisation. Endoscopy may be the only way of visualisation in transcanal myringoplasty for the retraction pocket, stapedoplasty and transcanal ossiculoplasty. In canal wall up or second look tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy endoscopy may serve as an additional point of view supported the classical microscopical technique. In result of many manners in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media, there are very concept for endoscopy application. In the ENT Department at Medical University of Warsaw were performed 53 procedures by aid of endoscopy in period from September 2009 to December 2010. In this study there were 18 canal wall up tympanoplasties, 12 second look tympanoplasties and 8 canal wall down tympanoplasties. According to authors' experience endoscopy is the most useful in: There were three cases of cholesteatoma recurrence in the study found only due to endoscope support. In authors' opinion, the endoscopy is the useful tool in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media. Application of endoscopy during the middle ear surgery results in decrease in frequency of cholestatoma recurrence and increase in the effectiveness of the ossiculoplasty.

T1  - Clinical indications for canal wall-down mastoidectomy in a pediatric population
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish clinically derived indications for performing canal wall-up or canal wall-down surgery when treating children with cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review.SETTING: Tertiary care academic pediatric otolaryngology practice.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 420 children who underwent 700 procedures for cholesteatoma between 1996 and 2010.RESULTS: The canal wall was preserved in 89.5% of cases. Common reasons for removing the canal wall were to provide access to the disease, extensive erosion of key structures, and the desire to avoid further surgery. The mean pure-tone average (PTA) for the canal wall-up group was 30 dB, whereas the canal wall-down group had a mean PTA of 45 dB. A matched-pairs analysis demonstrated that the better performance of the canal wall-up group was independent of preoperative hearing levels. Furthermore, although the presence of the stapes did influence hearing results, the canal wall-up procedure yielded better results even when the condition of the stapes was taken into account. The number needed to treat with canal wall-up to prevent 1 case of hearing loss (ie, mean threshold >30 dB) would be around 6. The need for revision surgery was higher in the canal wall-up group (51%) compared with the canal wall-down group (21%).CONCLUSION: In the setting of adequate follow-up and open access to surgical resources, most children with cholesteatoma can be managed with an intact canal wall technique. The authors believe that the better audiometric outcomes and easier postoperative care outweigh the need for revision surgery in this group.

T1  - Type III tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis: anatomic and functional results
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate anatomical and functional results using titanium prostheses in cartilage palisade tympanoplasties.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. Data were collected from patients' charts and clinical review.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.INTERVENTION: Cartilage tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis after tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy in patients operated on between July 1998 and February 2006.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anatomical results (closure of the perforation, rate of retraction pockets, recurrent cholesteatoma, and extrusion and re-perforation rates) were clinically evaluated. Pure-tone averages of air and bone conduction were analyzed. A postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) of 20 dB or less was taken to represent successful hearing.The hearing outcomes of canal wall up (CWU), canal wall down (CWD), primary and revision surgeries, and 2 groups of a short-term (<12 mo) or long-term (>24 mo) follow-up (f-u) were assessed and compared.RESULTS: Ninety-four cases were observed during the visiting period: 43 (45.7%) underwent primary procedures and 51 (54.3%) underwent revision surgeries. Closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 98.9%.Postoperative ABG was 20 dB or lower in 62 (66%) of 93 cases, between 11 and 20 dB in 33 cases (35%), and 10 dB or lower in 29 cases (31%).All cases undergoing CWU had a mean +/- SD postoperative ABG of 14.59 +/- 11.28 dB. There were no statistically significant differences (independent-samples t test, p = 0.5) between these patients and those receiving CWD surgery (15.95 +/- 10 dB).Thirty-eight (68%) of 56 CWD and 24 (64%) of 37 CWU cases achieved a postoperative ABG between 0 and 20 dB (chi = 0.08, p = 0.7, correlation = 0.031).Thirty-three (64.7%) of 51 who underwent revision surgeries and 29 (69%) of 42 who underwent primary procedures had a postoperative ABG between 0 and 20 dB. The difference between the groups was not significant (chi = 0.3, correlation = 0.058, p = 0.5).The mean ABG in the short f-u group was 12.38 +/- 7.34. There was no significant difference regarding long-term f-u after 24 months (11.76 +/- 8.9; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.7).We compared the mean postoperative ABG in low hearing frequencies (500 and 1,000 Hz) and high hearing frequencies (2,000 and 4,000 Hz). A better sound transmission was achieved in high frequencies (10.32 +/- 10.6 versus 20.61 +/- 13.73 dB, respectively); the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001, paired-samples t test).CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that tympanoplasty with titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis reconstruction offers a stable improvement of the ABG less than 20 dB in 66% of cases, in both short-term and long-term f-u. There were no differences in the results between CWU and CWD or between primary and revision surgery. The titanium prosthesis achieves the best acoustical results for sound transmission at high frequencies (2,000 and 4,000 Hz).

T1  - Results of primary ossiculoplasty in ears with an intact stapes superstructure and malleus handle: inflammation in the middle ear at the time of surgery does not affect hearing outcomes
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether any factors are predictive of success or failure in primary ossiculoplasty employing autologous bone in Austin-Kartush Group A (stapes and malleus handle present) ears.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of a single-surgeon case series.SETTING: Two District General Hospitals in the United Kingdom.PATIENTS: Of 135 patients undergoing primary repair, 116 had sufficient data for analysis (mean follow-up 33 months).MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED: Postoperative air-bone gaps (pABG) in patients with differing qualities of middle-ear mucosa (active versus inactive), differing pathologies (mucosal versus squamous) and differing surgical procedures [canal-wall up (CWU) versus canal-wall down (CWD)].SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE: 'Belfast Rule of Thumb' (operated ear hearing brought to 30 dB or better or to within 15 dB of contralateral ear).RESULTS: Postoperative ABGs were closed within 10 dB in 37%, 20 dB in 74% at latest follow-up. The only significant factors predicting hearing outcomes were the status of the canal wall (CWU = 14.1 dB, CWD = 24.7 dB: significant, P = 0.00) and whether surgery was primary or revision. Mean ABG was 14.7 for inactive middle ear mucosa, 17.2 for active middle ear mucosa (not significant, P = 0.25). Excluding CWD procedures from the analysis improved outcomes to 80% (within 20 dB) and 41% (within 10 dB) overall, and the mean for active and inactive ears to 14.2 and 14.0 dB respectively. Postoperatively, 82% of patients fulfilled the 'Belfast Rule of Thumb'.CONCLUSION: The most significant prognostic factor affecting hearing outcomes - status of the canal wall - is independent of staging. The factor most associated with staging - the status of the middle ear mucosa - is only weakly associated with a successful functional outcome.

T1  - [Techniques end results of surgical treatment cholesteatoma of middle ear]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Basic surgical techniques in the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma include the intact-canal-wall and canal-wall-down tympanoplasty and combined method, i.e. the "mobile-bridge" tympanoplasty. The techniques including reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal are combination of formerly mentioned methods. These tympanoplasty procedures involve a partial or complete removal of the posterior bone wall of the meatus. Subsequently, after the elimination of pathological process, the reconstruction of the middle ear is performed.MATERIAL AND METHODS: 200 patients with middle ear cholesteatoma, who had undergone various microsurgical procedures, were monitored and evaluated in the period 1998-2006. The aim of this study was to present the main principles of tympanoplasty and outcomes of middle ear cholesteatoma surgery through a comparative analysis of the applied tympanoplasty techniques. The closed ICW and open CWD tympanoplasty were compared with the combined mobile-bridge technique with the reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal.RESULTS: The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techniques with radical trepanation of the temporal bone were 6% and 10%, respectively. In cases of combined mobile-bridge tympanoplasty with the reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the auditory canal the incidence of residual cholesteatoma was 2%. The postoperative rejection of the replanted bone was observed in 2% of. the patients.CONCLUSION: The selection of the appropriate surgical procedure is determined by the type and extent of pathological process, anatomic features of the pneumatic space of the middle ear, available microsurgical equipment and otosurgical skills of the surgeon.

T1  - Mastoid and epitympanic bony obliteration in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of cholesteatoma surgery is complete eradication of the disease. To lower the recurrence rate in the pediatric population in canal wall up techniques and to avoid the disadvantages of canal wall down techniques, the bony obliteration technique with epitympanic and mastoid obliteration has been developed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical outcome and recurrence rate of this technique in children.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.SETTING: : Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Fifty-two children (<16 yr) were operated on in 90.4% (n = 47) for a primary or recurrent cholesteatoma and in 9.6% (n = 5) for an unstable cavity.INTERVENTION: In all cases, we closed the tympanoattical barrier and the posterior tympanotomy with sculpted cortical bone and then completed obliteration of the epitympanum and mastoid with bone pate. A reconstruction of the middle ear was performed by means of an allograft tympanic membrane including the malleus handle and a sculpted allograft malleus or incus for columellar reconstruction.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recurrent rate; residual rate; functional outcome; hygienic status of the ear; long-term safety issues.RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 49.5 months (range, 12-101.3 mo). Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in 1.9% (n = 1). Residual cholesteatoma was detected in 15.4% (n = 8) of the cases. Postoperative hearing results revealed a median gain on pure-tone averages of 14.3 dB and a median postoperative air-bone gap of 25.6 dB.CONCLUSION: The mastoid and epitympanic BOT is an effective technique to lower the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma in the pediatric population. Follow-up by magnetic resonance imaging provides a safe, noninvasive method for postoperative detection of residual cholesteatoma.

T1  - Audiologic results of surgery for cholesteatoma: short- and long-term follow-up of influential factors
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the audiologic results in a cohort of patients surgically treated for cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of patient records.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: A retrospective study of patients operated on for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma during the period 1990 to 2002 was performed. A total of 758 patients were followed during a short-term period, and 611 patients were followed during a long-term period. The patients were divided into 3 age groups: children, adolescents, and adults. The localization of cholesteatoma was classified as attic, sinus, or tensa.INTERVENTIONS: Closed tympanoplasty was always performed as the single procedure of choice on all the children, and reoperation or conversion to open tympanoplasty was made later if needed. Adult patients were treated with single classic canal wall up, or wall down (CWD), according to the propagation of disease and condition of middle ear.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and pure-tone average were compared after short-term and long-term follow-up.RESULTS: Average hearing improvement (reduction of ABG) amounted 20.0 dB for short-term and deteriorated to 18.0 dB during long-term analysis for all the patients. Preoperative hearing level was significantly worse for CWD than for intact canal wall technique. The ABG closure was much better in the group with attic cholesteatoma. Both preoperative and postoperative hearing levels were worse for children than for adolescents or adults. Revision operations and bilateral cholesteatoma gave worse total postoperative hearing. The long-term results of primary operations, when recurrent cholesteatoma did not occur, were stable. Damage to auditory ossicles correlated well with total preoperative and postoperative results. The most hearing improvement was verified for the frequencies between 500 and 3,000 Hz, and there was no sensorineural hearing loss.CONCLUSION: The audiologic results of cholesteatoma surgery are preserved during long-term follow-up. We found that recurrent cholesteatoma was associated with diminished postoperative hearing. Poorer preoperative hearing level, CWD tympanoplasty, younger age, bilateral cholesteatoma, and ossicular damage, as well as revision surgery, were associated with reduced gains in hearing with surgical management. Surgical experience was important for ICW technique and for advanced damage of auditory ossicles. Recurrent cholesteatoma resulted in significantly worse hearing results for each analyzed parameter.

T1  - The investigation of the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: Three hundred forty-five patients with middle ear cholesteatoma operated on by the same surgeon between 1987 and 2002.METHODS: The cumulative recurrence rate of cholesteatoma during a 5-year follow-up period was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.RESULTS: The overall 5-year recurrence rate was 11.8%. The recurrence rate increased with the follow-up time. The 5-year recurrence rate was 3.9% in patients treated with canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWDT) and 16.7% in patients treated with intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall reconstruction (CWR) after CWDT with a significant difference (p < 0.01). The 5-year recurrence rate was 26.0% in patients operated on between 1987 and 1996 and 0.7% in patients operated on between 1997 and 2002, again with a significant difference (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis should be used for calculating the recurrence rate of cholesteatoma. Although this analytic method further demonstrates that CWDT is a more reliable surgical method than ICWT/CWR in reducing cholesteatoma recurrence, clinical judgment should be exercised, and we continue to recommend that a flexible approach should be adopted in deciding whether to perform CWDT or ICWT/CWR for individual cases.

T1  - Residual cholesteatoma: incidence and localization in canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence and localization of residual cholesteatomas in canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction with results with the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty or canal wall up tympanoplasty.DESIGN: Retrospective case-series study.SETTING: Tertiary care university hospital.PATIENTS: Eighty-five patients (85 ears) with fresh extensive cholesteatomas who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction as first-stage surgery and a second operation after 1 year to confirm residual cholesteatomas and perform ossiculoplasty.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The incidence and localization of residual cholesteatomas in the middle ear were compared between surgery using the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty and canal wall up tympanoplasty. Possible technical causes of the residua were reviewed in a retrospective videotape analysis of the first-stage operations.RESULTS: Of the 85 ears operated on, 18 had residual cholesteatomas, for an overall incidence of 21%, with 1 residuum per ear. Six cholesteatomas were located in the epitympanum (33%), 3 in the sinus tympani (17%), 3 in the antrum (17%), 2 on the stapes (11%), 2 on the tympanic membrane (11%), 1 on the tympanic portion of the facial canal (6%), and 1 just under the skin of the external auditory canal (6%). The retrospective videotape analysis revealed that the main cause of residual cholesteatomas in the epitympanum and sinus tympani was incomplete removal of the matrix under an indirect surgical view because of insufficient drilling. Residual matrix in a bony defect in the middle cranial fossa or facial canal was the cause of residual cholesteatomas in the antrum or facial canal. Inappropriate keratinizing epithelium rolling during tympanic membrane or external auditory canal reconstruction was the cause of residual cholesteatomas in the tympanic membrane or external auditory canal.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of residual cholesteatomas in patients who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction was similar to that in patients who underwent surgery involving the canal wall down and open tympanoplasty or canal wall up tympanoplasty. In terms of localization, with canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction, there is the possibility of residua not only in the tympanic cavity but also in the antrum or mastoid cavity, as with the canal wall up method. Results of this study suggest that in patients with extensive cholesteatoma, canal wall down tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction should be followed by a second procedure to detect any residual cholesteatomas in the tympanic cavity, antrum, or mastoid cavity.

T1  - Managing chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma report of 223 patients seen in a 5-year period
AB  - BACKGROUND: To assess the clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of patients having chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma seen in the ENT/Head and Neck Surgery Clinic at the University Clinical Center, Prishtina, Kosovo.METHOD: A systematic review of the medical records of all patients admitted to the ENT clinic having COM with cholesteatoma between January 1999 and December 2003.RESULTS: During this period, 223 patients suffering from COM with cholesteatoma underwent surgical treatment. There were 123 (55%) male and 100 (45%) female patients. Their mean age was 30.7 years, ranging from youngest patient (7-year-old girl) to oldest (73-year-old lady). Thirty-three patients developed complications: 17 patients extracranial complications (EC) and 16 intracranial complications (IC). Leading pathogens in this series were Proteus mirabilis in 52% of cases, Proteus vulgaris in 14% and Staphylococcus aureus in 12%. All patients underwent surgical treatment: 10 patients (4.5%) a canal-wall up (CWU) procedure and 213 (95.5%) a canal-wall down (CWD) procedure. No deaths occurred in this series.CONCLUSION: Because of possibility of developing life-threatening complications, patients with COM with cholestatoma must diagnosed in time and followed as soon as possible to the center that performs ear surgery, as only adequate treatment option for these patients.

T1  - [Surgical strategy for treatment of cholesteatoma otitis media]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the otologic surgical procedures for cholesteatoma otitis media and improve the surgery results and living quality of patients following the operation of tympanomastoidectomy.METHODS: Two hundreds and sixty-six cases (269 ears) of tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma otitis media followed up for more than 3 years between 1994 to 2003 were analyzed retrospectively. The long-term results of recurrence and hearing level was discussed on the procedure of canal wall up (CWU), canal wall down (CWD) and modified intact-bridge tympanomastoidectomy (IBM).RESULTS: On the contrast of improved hearing level, there were not significant difference between CWU group and CWD group (F = 3.686, P>0.05), but the results of IBM group was significantly better than others (F = 125.167 and 59.438, P <0.05). On the contrast of duration of getting dry ear, IBM and CWU groups [(5.0 +/- 1.9) weeks and (6.0 +/- 1.6) weeks respectively] were significantly shorter than CWD group [(9.0 +/- 2.8) weeks; F = 56.32 and 30.639, P <0.05]. As the recurrence rate, IBM group and CWD group were significantly lower than CWU group (CWU: 24.6%; CWD: 6.0%; IBM: 7.0%) chi2 = 6.162 and 6.007, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: With the modified IBM technique, cholesteatoma could be removed completely and safely from the middle ear and a reasonable reconstruction of middle ear with approved hearing level could be achieved. The surgical procedure usually began with CWU and should be change according to the pathological founding of middle ear during operation. Modified IBM was a valuable choice for the surgical treatment of cholesteatoma otitis media.

T1  - Tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy, is highly effective for treatment of chronic otitis media in children
AB  - CONCLUSION: The overall success rate of tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy, in the treatment of chronic pediatric otitis media, was high and did not depend on patient age, the status of the contralateral ear, the inclusion or absence of surgical mastoidectomy, or the method of mastoidectomy (when this procedure was employed). Tympanoplasty may be expected to improve hearing in cases of chronic otitis media accompanied by perforation, but not in cases of cholesteatoma.OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the clinical features of pediatric patents with chronic otitis media undergoing tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy. Follow-up data were examined to determine the effectiveness of these procedures on the course of the patients' conditions.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 111 children (a total of 119 ears were treated from this group) aged 15 years or less, who underwent surgical treatment for pediatric chronic otitis media. The subjects were composed of children suffering from chronic otitis media with perforation (COMP) (63 ears), and patients presenting chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (COMC) (56 ears). The mean follow-up period was 40 months. Preoperative and postoperative (at the final follow-up) audiometry and otologic examinations were performed. Data from postoperative otologic examinations and audiometric measurements were accompanied by examination of both the operative ear and the contralateral ear. Surgical success was defined as the presence of an intact tympanic membrane without perforation, retraction, or evidence of recurring cholesteatoma.RESULTS: The mean ages at the time of operation were 11.1+/-3.3 years for COMP patients and 9.7+/-3.0 years for COMC subjects. Surgical treatments for pediatric COMP and COMC patients included tympanoplasty only in 45 ears (38% of ears treated) and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy in 74 ears (62%). Most of patients with COMC received tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. No patient with COMP underwent canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Mean pre-operative air-bone gaps (ABGs) and post-operative ABGs were compared. Significant improvement in ABG was evident in the COMP group, but not in the COMC group. Surgical success rates at follow-up after 6 months and 12 months were 97% and 95%, respectively, in the COMP group. In the COMC patients, surgical success rates at follow-up after 6 months and 12 months were 98% and 93%. There were no significant relationships between surgical success rate and patient age, the status of the contralateral ear, or the extent of surgery.

T1  - Follow-up of cholesteatoma surgery: open versus closed tympanoplasty
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no universally accepted opinions about the choice of surgical technique and outcome of surgery for cholesteatoma in different age groups and localizations.METHODS: A prospective study of 758 patients with cholesteatomas was performed. They were divided into three age groups: children younger than 9 years, adolescents aged 10-16 years, and adults. Cholesteatoma was classified as: attic, sinus and tensa cholesteatoma. Classical canal wall-up or wall-down tympanoplasty was performed in all the cases, and reoperation was done later if needed. Anatomical and functional results were followed up regularly, and evaluated 3 years after the operations.RESULTS: During the postoperative course, after 3 years, retraction of the neomembrane was found in 23.8% of younger children, 27.6% of adolescents, and in 9.9% of adults. Recurrent cholesteatomas were more than twice as frequent in children (19.0%) as in adults (9.4%). Reoperation was performed in 38.1% of children and in 9.4% adults. In one fourth of pediatric cholesteatoma reoperations, conversion to open tympanoplasty was done. Retraction and recurrent disease were present in about 10% of attic and sinus cholesteatomas, and in 15.5% of tensa cholesteatomas.CONCLUSION: Postoperative audiological results of cholesteatoma surgery in children are comparable to adults. Retraction pockets, recurrent cholesteatomas and reoperations are twice as frequent in the pediatric group as in adults. The worst anatomical and functional results are achieved in tensa cholesteatomas. The age of the patient and localization of cholesteatoma are very important factors that determine the type of surgical procedure and the results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. A closed technique is better for attic and sinus cholesteatomas, while in tensa cholesteatomas, an open technique seems more appropriate. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

T1  - [Tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma in pediatric patients]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discuss the best strategy in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma in pediatric patient. Both intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (ICW) and canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (CWD) were the basic technique for cholesteatoma in pediatric patient. The outcomes of ICW and CWD as comparisons of different surgical technique were assessed.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric primary acquired cholesteatoma aged 4-14 years old between April, 1997 and October, 2003 was conducted. The follow-up information was completed. Forty-two patients (45 ears) were treated and followed from 1 to 7 years [ the average is (3.6 +/- 2. 6) years].RESULTS: ICW was the primary surgical treatment in 20 patients (20 ears) initially, the recidivism rate was 30% ( 6/20), the achieved rate of pure-tone threshold average (PTA) was 77% (13/17); Twenty-five (two) patients (45 ears) underwent CWD, the recidivism rate was 4% (1/25), the achieved rate of PTA was 72% (18/25).CONCLUSIONS: ICW had the advantage which could preserve the physical structure of the external acoustic meatus and had more profits for the treatment of cholesteatoma in pediatric patients, but it should be done for planned second stage surgery as a routine method that could get over the defect of recrudescence . If the function of eustachian tube was still not normal when planned second stage surgery operation was done, the CWD was suggested instead.

T1  - [Long-term results of functional surgery for attic cholesteatoma]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the long-term results of functional surgery for attic cholesteatoma.PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we presented the results of 81 patients (42 males 39 females; mean age 34 years; range 8 to 59 years) who underwent functional surgical techniques for attic cholesteatomas between January 1992 and January 1998. All the patients were followed-up for at least five years.RESULTS: For eradication of attic cholesteatoma, canal wall-down technique tympanoplasty was required in the majority of the patients. After surgery there was a statistically significant hearing improvement in all but four cases. In the postoperative period, residual cholesteatoma and graft perforation were found in five and six patients, respectively. Two patients required revision meatoplasty for problems related with cavity clearance.CONCLUSION: Apart from satisfactory hearing improvement with functional surgery, a successful self-clearance was obtained in mastoid cavities with saucerization and meatoplasty. Canal wall-down tympanoplasty is associated with very low incidences of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in the majority of patients.

T1  - [Studying the effect of surgery for cholesteatoma in children]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of surgical treatment on hearing for cholesteatoma in children.METHOD: The retrospective survey was carried out in 62 children with cholesteatoma treated surgically over a 5-year period. Sixty patients had acquired cholesteatoma and two had congenital cholesteatoma. Forty-eight patients had extensive invasion that required canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Twelve patients with attic cholesteatoma underwent canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and 2 patients with cholesteatoma localized to the middle-ear space were adequately treated with tympanic exploration.RESULT: Hearing was improved in 42 cases, preserved in 13 cases, became worse in 7 cases. A secondary surgical procedure for recidivistic (recurrent or residual) disease was performed in 3 cases. Facial paralysis was noted in 2 patients before surgical operation, and 2 patients had sensorineural hearing loss.CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma in children and demonstrated the need for careful preoperative evaluation, meticulous surgical technique, and prudent postoperative follow-up.

T1  - Surgical management of sinus tympani cholesteatoma
AB  - OBJECTIVE: the aim of this study is to describe the extension of unsafe middle ear disease in the sinus tympani and to review the methods of surgical access to remove the disease from this area.METHODS: Of the 164 operated ears with unsafe chronic suppurative otitis media 64(39%) ears had variable disease extension into the sinus tympani and were included in the study. Sixty two ears underwent canal wall down (CWD) procedure while remaining two underwent tympanoplasty with bone work.RESULT: Five operated ears had deeper extension of the disease into the sinus tympani. And despite of different maneuver the complete removal of the disease could not be confirmed. Six ears (9.4%) had recidivism.CONCLUSION: The study emphasizes on the greater incidence of this disease extension into this difficult anatomical area and their complete removal may not be always possible. But one should require thorough knowledge and surgical expertise to work in this difficult area of posterior mesotympanum.

T1  - Closed tympanoplasty in middle ear cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of closed tympanoplasty surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma and to compare the postoperative results with the outcomes of canal-wall-down mastoidectomy.METHODS: Seventy patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were involved in the study. Pneumo-otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry, anamnestic and clinical data were evaluated before the surgery. Modified radical mastoidectomy was performed for 31 patients. Thirty-nine patients were treated with closed tympanoplasty surgery, including intact canal wall mastoidectomy, endaural atticotomy, lateral attic and aditus wall reconstruction and tympanoplasty. The follow-up examination was carried out 12 months after the surgery. The recurrence of cholesteatoma, otorrhea and hearing level were evaluated postoperatively.RESULTS: Otorrhea was estimated in 4 cases (10.3%) after closed tympanoplasty surgery and in 6 cases (19.4%) after modified radical mastoidectomy. Among the patients who were operated using closed tympanoplasty technique the middle ear cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 12.8% and among those, who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy recurrent disease occurred in 9.7% of the cases. The hearing improvement was found in 15 cases (38.46%) after closed tympanoplasty, while there was no hearing improvement after modified radical mastoidectomy.CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that despite the fact, that cholesteatoma recurrence rate after closed tympanoplasty is relatively high, this surgical method permits to preserve adequate hearing level and releases from postoperative cavity care problems as compared with modified radical mastoidectomy.

T1  - Impact of mastoidectomy on simple tympanic membrane perforation repair
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Mastoidectomy has long been identified as an effective method of treatment for chronic ear infection. The effect of mastoidectomy on patients without evidence of active infectious disease remains highly debated and unproven. The objective in the study was to examine the impact of mastoidectomy on the repair of uncomplicated tympanic membrane perforations.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of patients at tertiary referral center.METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four patients who underwent surgical repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations were identified and reviewed in a retrospective manner. Simple tympanic membrane perforations were defined as tympanic membrane perforations of any size and location without any of the following confounding variables: 1). active infection (active otorrhea, abnormal middle ear mucosa, or granulations tissue); 2). ossicular abnormalities (ossicular fixation, ossicular discontinuity, ossicular malformation, or ossicular absence); 3). cholesteatoma; or 4). prior attempt at tympanic membrane repair (prior tympanoplasty or mastoidectomy). Surgical outcome and clinical course were assessed to compare results of tympanic membrane perforation repair with and without canal wall up mastoidectomy.RESULTS: Tympanic membrane repair was equally effective in both groups at 91%. Hearing results were comparable. Development of persistent ipsilateral otological disease requiring a subsequent ipsilateral procedure was approximately twice as common in the tympanoplasty group. In the tympanoplasty group, 14.1% of patients underwent subsequent ipsilateral otological procedures, and 6.1% of patients in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy intact canal wall group underwent subsequent ipsilateral procedures (P <.05). The most common subsequent ipsilateral procedures were tympanoplasty, tympanostomy tube placement, tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall up, and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy canal wall down, in that order. After including untreated tympanic membrane perforations as subsequent procedures, the adjusted rate of subsequent procedures was 15.5% in the tympanoplasty group and 12.2% in the tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy group (P >.05).CONCLUSION: Mastoidectomy was not necessary for successful repair of simple tympanic membrane perforations. However, mastoidectomy impacted the clinical course in patients by reducing the number of patients requiring future procedures and by decreasing disease progression. This suggests that even in the absence of active evidence of infection, mastoidectomy improved the underlying disease process. Combining mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty during repair of simple perforations in patients with no active evidence of infection remains an appropriate option and may be valuable in reducing the need for future surgery.

T1  - [Sinus tympani in surgery of the middle ear and skull base]
AB  - Tympanic sinus is located at the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. It's visualisation is difficult from most of approaches. Tympanic sinus is often filled with cholesteatoma in course of chronic otitis. Intraoperative assessment of tympanic sinus was performed in 29 patients with facial recess cholesteatoma, and in 20 patients with acoustic neuroma operated with translabyrinthine approach. In the group of patients with cholesteatoma four patients underwent canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy, 25 underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty. Tympanic sinus was assessed during surgery with 30 degrees endoscope. In all cases depth of the sinus was measured with the use of calibrated hook. In 11 patients depth of the sinus exceeded 4 mm. In 6 among these features of bone destruction was found.

T1  - Management of cholesteatoma: status of the canal wall
AB  - OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: Management of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma remains controversial. The purpose of the study is to examine factors associated with the surgical approach to manage cholesteatoma.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective review.METHODS: A retrospective review was made of all primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma performed at an otological center between 1995 and 2000. During the study period, 486 ears underwent surgery for cholesteatoma. Data included procedures performed, location and extent of the disease, residual and recurrent disease, complications, reasons for staging the surgery, and duration of follow-up.RESULTS: The canal wall remained intact in 68.5% of ears. The majority of the remainder of the patients underwent a canal wall down technique with mastoid obliteration. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 26.9% of second procedures and in 2.7% of third procedures.CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients with cholesteatoma can be adequately managed with a canal intact tympanomastoidectomy with staging. Otolaryngologists should consider a two-staged procedure as a viable management approach for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma.

T1  - [Tympanic-ossicular reconstruction. Functional results using cartilage palisades and titanium prostheses]
AB  - The Eustachian tube disfunction and abnormalities in gas exchange through the middle ear mucosa may produce negative pressure and retraction pockets, adhesions, atelectasis and cholesteatomas. If this problem is present postoperatively, it may again lead to retraction, reperforation, and/or extrusion of the reconstructed ossicular chain. This applies especially if conventional autologous material, such as fascia and perichondrium, are used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. This paper reviews the indications, surgical technique, and functional results of 23 tympanoplasties using cartilage and titanium prostheses, with range follow-up of 20-55 months and a mean of 30 months. Seven out of sixteen canal wall down (43.7%) and three out seven canal wall up (42.9%) had a postoperative air-bone gap between 0 and 10 dB.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media: recurrent-residual disease and hearing
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effect of surgical approach, intact canal wall (ICW) or canal wall down (CWD), upon the success of revision surgery for chronic otitis media (COM). A retrospective analysis of 367 patients (including 65 children aged <15 years) who underwent revision tympanoplasty because of persistent disease was performed. Single-staged tympanoplasty was performed, preserving the canal wall when present. Hearing was reconstructed with allograft incus. Follow-up ranged from one to 15 years. Hearing was determined by pre- and post-operative air-bone gaps. Post-operative re-perforation, aural discharge and/or cholesteatoma rates were similar for CWD and ICW. Cholesteatoma could present following the revision, even though it was not apparent at surgery. Following tympanoplasty, the final hearing was not significantly affected by the surgical approach or presence of cholesteatoma. Improvement in hearing was adversely affected by cholesteatoma or an absent stapes suprastructure. Revision ICW and CWD operations were both successful in controlling signs of COM. Cholesteatoma is a peripheral risk in COM and may become apparent after revision surgery.

T1  - Detection of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) in human cholesteatomas and functional implications of correlations to recurrence status and to expression of matrix metalloproteinases-3/9, retinoic acid receptor-beta, and anti-apoptotic galectin-3
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the expression of the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) 1) is detectable, 2) changes in relation to recurrence and infection status, and 3) relates to the levels of expression of growth regulators/differentiation markers, including galectin-1, -3, and -8, retinoid acid receptors (RAR)]-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, binding sites for sarcolectin, and invasion markers (cathepsins -B and -D, and matrix metalloproteinases [MMP]-2, -3, and -9) in human cholesteatomas.STUDY DESIGN: An analysis of 56 cholesteatomas resected by the same surgeon using canal wall up and canal wall down surgical procedures.METHODS: The immunohistochemical levels of expression of MIF and the proteases were quantitatively determined (using computer-assisted microscopy) on routine histologic slides by specific antibodies, and statistically correlated to parameters of the other markers determined previously in conjunction with data on apoptosis/proliferation.RESULTS: MIF expression was detected. It was significantly higher in the epithelium (P =.002) and vessels (P =.04) of the connective tissues (but not in the connective tissue itself) of recurrent as opposed to non-recurrent cholesteatomas. The MIF expression is significantly correlated (P =.006) to the RAR beta expression in non-infected cholesteatomas, and to MMP-3 (P <.01) and anti-apoptotic galectin-3 (P =.01) in infected cholesteatomas. The level of MIF expression was also correlated significantly to MMP-9 (P = 0.003), RAR beta (P <.001), and galectin-8 (P =.003) expression in the cholesteatomas regardless of their infection status.CONCLUSIONS: MIF expression in human cholesteatomas is related to the levels of biologic aggressiveness reflected in their recurrence status and MMP expression, and to the differentiation status reflected in their galactin and RAR beta expressions. Together with galectin-3, it could cooperate to form an anti-apoptotic feedback loop.

T1  - The levels of expression of galectin-3, but not of galectin-1 and galectin-8, correlate with apoptosis in human cholesteatomas
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether galectins 1, 3, and 8 are expressed in human cholesteatomas and whether any such expression does correlate with the level of apoptosis, which is, as we have previously shown, predictive of recurrence.7STUDY DESIGN: The analysis of 52 cholesteatomas resected by the same surgeon by means of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures.METHODS: The immunohistochemical levels of expression of galectins 1, 3, and 8 were quantitatively determined (using computer-assisted microscopy) on conventional histological slides by means of specific anti-galectin-1, anti-galectin-3, and anti-galectin-8 antibodies. The level of apoptosis in each cholesteatoma under study had already been determined 7 by means of the in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (Tolt-mediated dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] staining).RESULTS: Galectin-1 was expressed markedly in both the epithelial and the connective tissue areas of all the cholesteatomas under study. The levels of expression of galectin-3 and galectin-8 were considerably lower than that of galectin-1. The level of expression of galectin-3 correlated both highly and positively with the level of apoptosis.CONCLUSIONS: An upregulation of galectin-3 (known to have an antiapoptotic and antianoikis effect in certain model systems) expression, which is associated with pronounced apoptotic activity, could have a physiologically protective effect against the characteristically substantial apoptotic features occurring in recurrent cholesteatomas.

T1  - Retrograde mastoidectomy with canal wall reconstruction: a single-stage technique for cholesteatoma removal
AB  - The goal of this retrospective study was to report the preliminary results of the retrograde mastoidectomy technique with canal wall reconstruction used as a primary treatment method for cholesteatoma. This synthesis of canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) techniques was performed in 70 patients (75 ears; 35 pediatric, 40 adult) with an average 45-month follow-up. Surgical intervention involved removal of a portion of the canal wall for exposure and extirpation of the cholesteatoma, followed by reestablishment of the canal wall during reconstruction in a single stage. This leaves the mucosa relatively undisturbed and limits the extent of canal wall removal, facilitating mastoid aeration and preservation of anatomy. Recurrent disease occurred in 5% of cases. The hearing improvement was statistically significant (p < .05), with an average preoperative 4-frequency pure tone average air-bone gap of 27.2 dB improving to 11.5 dB. No patient had a worsening of hearing. The surgery takes less time than traditional techniques, is reproducible and easily taught, and can be universally applied to all cholesteatoma patients as primary treatment.

T1  - Surgical treatment of labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma
AB  - In a 144-month period, 27 cases of labyrinthine fistula (LF) were seen, and 360 mastoid operations were performed; the LF prevalence was 7.5%. Primary symptoms were hypoacusis, otorrhea, vertigo, tinnitus, and otalgia. All patients underwent preoperative CT scans and preoperative audiometry. LF diagnosis was made before surgery for 93% of patients on the basis of symptoms, signs, and imaging studies. With respect to surgical technique, the canal-wall-down procedure was performed in 92%, and the canal-wall-up procedure was performed in 8%. In 88% of patients the fistula was located in the horizontal semicircular canal. In 96% of patients the cholesteatoma matrix was removed, and the fistula was sealed; in 4% of patients the matrix was left. With a follow-up of 13 years, vertigo disappeared in 96% of patients, and hearing remained unchanged in 70% of patients. Further complications of chronic otitis media existed in approximately half of the patients with LF. Open surgery with removal of the cholesteatoma matrix and sealing of the fistula with temporalis fascia in a canal-wall-down manner is a safe procedure that can make vertigo disappear and helps to preserve cochlear function.

T1  - Soft-wall reconstruction for cholesteatoma surgery: reappraisal
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the validity of the soft-wall reconstruction method of the posterior meatal wall in surgeries for cholesteatomas.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.PATIENTS: Subjects consisted of 52 patients (54 ears) with fresh cholesteatoma (excluding residual or recurrent cholesteatomas) who were operated by the soft-wall reconstruction method in our clinic and observed for more than 2 years after surgery, and 29 patients (29 ears) who were operated by canal-wall-down and open method.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative period required for complete epithelization (dry ear), hearing, and incidence of the residual and recurrent cholesteatomas were compared with those operated by canal-wall-down and open method. The postoperative conditions of the soft posterior meatal wall was also investigated.RESULTS: Postoperative period to be a dry ear was significantly shorter in the soft-wall reconstruction group than in the canal-wall-down and open group (Student's t-test, t = 2.99, p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in the postoperative hearing or incidence of residual and recurrent cholesteatomas between the two groups.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the soft-wall reconstruction method seems more versatile than the canal-wall-down and open method for cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed patients surgically treated for cholesteatoma to determine the impact of surgical procedures on preoperative hearing status and whether there was preservation, improvement, or deterioration. We reviewed 173 patients treated over a 15-year period. One hundred eighteen (68%) patients had acquired cholesteatoma and 55 (32%) patients had congenital cholesteatoma. One hundred (58%) patients had extensive disease on presentation that required canal wall-down mastoidectomy. Patients with attic cholesteatoma underwent canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and those with cholesteatoma localized to the middle-ear space were adequately treated with tympanotomy. Hearing was preserved in 101 cases (59%), improved in 30 (17%), became worse in 23 (13%), and could not be accurately assessed in 19 (11%) due to lack of documentation. A second surgical procedure for recidivistic (recurrent or residual) disease was required in 53 (30%). Ipsilateral facial paralysis was noted in 3 (1.7%) patients immediately after recovery from anaesthesia, and 1 (0.5%) patient had a sensorineural hearing loss. This study confirmed the aggressiveness of cholesteatoma in children and demonstrated the need for careful preoperative evaluation, meticulous surgical technique, and prudent postoperative follow-up.

T1  - Relevant issues in revision canal-wall-down mastoidectomy
AB  - The role of canal-wall-down (CWD) versus intact-canal-wall (ICW) mastoidectomy in the treatment of chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma remains a debated issue. Although past conventional wisdom has held that CWD mastoid surgery leads to a "safe" ear and is technically less demanding than the more controversial ICW mastoidectomy, this is often not the case. Although our preference is an ICW technique when possible, 47 of 109 (43%) mastoid procedures for chronic otitis media performed between January 1993 and June 1996 involved a CWD mastoid cavity. More than two thirds of these procedures (32 of 47) represented revision surgery, the most common indication being a poorly contoured, preexisting CWD mastoidectomy with persistent otorrhea. A dry, well-epithelialized ear was obtained in 90% of cases. Our preferred method of ossicular reconstruction (double cartilage block ossiculoplasty) is detailed, and hearing results according to American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery guidelines are reported.

T1  - [Middle ear cholesteatoma in children. Criteria for surgical procedure in 57 cases]
AB  - Fifty five children with 57 cholesteatomas (2 bilateral cholesteatomas) were operated on by the same surgeon. The median period of follow-up was 87 months. Fifteen cases were lost to follow-up (26%). An ossicular erosion was present in 76% of cases. In the first stage, an "intact canal wall technique" (ICWT) was carried out in 44% and a "canal wall down technique" (CWDT) in 56%. A planned second stage was carried out in 76% of ICWT and 56% of CWDT. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was 29% and the incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma was 11%. A third stage was carried out in 6 cases (11%) without residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Finally a CWDT was performed in 65% and a ICWT in 35%. The hearing results were significantly better with ICWT but this was due to a better preoperative hearing level. Whatever the surgical technique, the hearing results were better in the presence of an intact stapes. The surgery was individualized. Although ICWT is our priority technique, it was feasible, in our experience, only in a minority of cases because of difficult ablation, insufficient eustachian tube function and very advanced sigmoid sinus or very low lying tegmen plate. Minimal postoperative cavity problems were encountered, even in children where in our experience the mastoidal pneumatisation is limited.

T1  - [Trans-canal mastoidectomy]
AB  - UNLABELLED: The controversy regarding the best procedure for treating middle ear cholesteatoma has lasted over 100 years. This paper discusses our current methods for dealing with cholesteatoma, always through external ear or transmeatal mastoidectomy. We present the results of three years of follow-up.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study was made of 215 ears operated for cholesteatoma using a transcanal approach with one of three techniques: "on demand" DAA mastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy, and radical mastoidectomy with obliteration. Three parameters were used to evaluate results: stability of the mastoid cavity, integrity of the neotympanum, and evolution of hearing.RESULTS: The rate of cholesteatoma recurrence in ears operated with these techniques was much lower than that found in canal-wall-up techniques. Only 3 of the 215 cases (1.4%) remained unstable due to different causes three years after surgery.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Due to the high rate of cholesteatoma recurrence, canal-wall-up mastoidectomy has been abandoned in our clinic. Open techniques using a transmeatal approach, with or without obliteration, and the so-called "on demand" mastoidectomy, have yielded more stable results, although postoperative care is more critical.

T1  - Revision surgery for chronic otitis media: a learning experience. Report on 389 cases with a long-term follow-up
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, during a long-term follow-up period, the results of revision surgery for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Intact canal wall and canal wall down procedures were performed. The surgical history of every patient was assessed before the operation. A dry, relatively safe, and disease-free ear was created in 90% of the reoperated ears (N = 389). The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 5% for the total group. Reperforations of the tympanic membrane occurred in 10%, and persistent or recurrent otorrhea was present in 10% of cases. The functional hearing results were quite satisfactory. A residual air-bone gap of < or =30 dB was reached in 70.3% of the cases after revision tympanoplasty only (N = 41). Revision mastoidectomy with revision tympanoplasty as a one-stage procedure led subsequently, in 76% of intact canal wall procedures (N = 113) and 55% of canal wall down procedures (N = 98), to a residual air-bone gap of < or =30 dB.

T1  - [Preliminary functional results of tympanoplasty with palisade cartilage]
AB  - Total or subtotal reconstruction of the tympanic membrane with cartilage palisades counteracts the tendency to retraction observed in ears with functional problems of the tube or altered gas exchange of the mucosa, in contrast with "soft" autologous materials such as temporal fascia or perichondrium. Because of its low turnover, cartilage is more resistant to the prolonged absence of neovascularization from the periphery in (sub) total perforation making it more resistant to infection. However, the use of palisade cartilage has been questioned for the functional recuperation of the middle ear because of its rigidity and thickness. A retrospective study was made of the functional results of 148 type III tympanoplasties with partial or complete reconstruction with cartilage after a one-stage procedure. A comparison of 108 ears with a mean postoperative follow-up of 20 months and 40 ears with a mean follow-up of more than 6 months showed no statistically significant difference in the overall functional results. A "social" hearing level (GAP < 30 dB) was achieved in 83.2%: the gain was 1-30 dB in 75.6% of cases (n = 112). No statistically significant differences were found between the functional results of primary surgery and re-operation. Statistically significant differences were found in the functional results of canal wall down and canal wall up procedures.

T1  - Pediatric cholesteatoma: an individualized, single-stage approach
AB  - We report our experience with a one-stage surgery for pediatric cholesteatoma in 216 ears. Our technique is based on three main principles: (1) the surgery is individualized; (2) the goal of surgery is to completely remove cholesteatoma and related disease in one operation; and (3) the reconstruction is performed to provide both good hearing and a dry, trouble-free ear. The incidence of recidivism was 10.2%, and the rate achieved was 13.3% at 5 years and 24% at 10 years. Canal wall down surgery was the predominant procedure used. The incidence of intraoperative neurosensory hearing loss, vertigo, and facial nerve injury was extremely low. The postoperative cavity problems encountered were minimal.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery with the canal-wall-down technique
AB  - This is a retrospective study of a limited group of 30 patients, children and adults, diagnosed as having cholesteatomas. Analysis includes audiological data and surgical results. Two techniques were used in surgery. In half of the cases, an obliteration technique was used, and in the remainder an open radical cavity was created. The method used was determined by the surgeon and in some measure by the extent of the disease. Our conclusions are that the obliteration technique offers better hearing results than the open-cavity technique. The number of residuals over a 4- to 5-year period was acceptable and cavity problems were avoided.

T1  - Hearing results of surgery for acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Hearing results in 349 chronic ears with cholesteatoma were evaluated. The great majority of the patients underwent canal wall-down mastoidectomy as a one-stage procedure. After a mean follow-up period of 7.3 years, 35% of the ears operated on showed hearing levels of 30 dB or better. Hearing improved in 30%, remained unchanged in 55%, and worsened in 15%. The mean hearing gain was only 5 dB. In 23% of ears with otherwise successful outcomes the tympanum turned fibrotic, leading to poor hearing function.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Cholesteatoma in children is a particularly difficult disorder because of the special developmental issues unique to the age group and the long-term follow-up implications of surgical changes to the ear. The two basic controversies are canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down surgery, and staged versus single-stage surgery. No single philosophy is applicable to all children with cholesteatoma. Instead, the surgeon should individualize the management of pediatric cholesteatoma by considering the location and extent of the cholesteatoma, the overall status of infections and hearing, socioeconomic issues of access to follow-up and future surgery, and the likelihood of compliance with the full management plan.

T1  - [Fixed retraction pockets and cholesteatoma in children. Authors' experience with 199 cases]
AB  - Cholesteatoma is more destructive in the child than in the adult, but few studies have examined the outcome as a function of age. The authors evaluated retrospectively their experience in 199 cases of cholesteatomas or uncontrollable fixed retraction pouches in children under the age of 15. Mean follow-up was 2 and a half years and the anatomic and functional results are detailed. Reasons for performing first intention or second intention canal wall up or down procedures were analyzed as a function of age. Residual cholesteatomas were particularly frequent in whatever the initial surgical procedure. Cholesteatomas and retraction pouches in the child under 5 (n = 24) were particularly aggressive and destructive, often requiring a canal wall down operation. Residual cholesteatomas were also very frequent and involved both bony and functional element of the petrus. The clinical course of cholesteatoma in the young child appears to be very different, becoming less destructive as the child reaches adulthood.

T1  - [Cholesteatoma in children. Apropos of 104 cases]
AB  - Between 1988 and 1993, 94 children from 3 to 15 years of age underwent one or more surgical procedures for cholesteatoma or epithelization of the middle ear space. Ten children had bilateral disease. 94 ears were operated for the first time and 10 ears had had previous surgery at other institutions. A total of 204 procedures were performed: 190 for cholesteatoma and 14 for epithelization of the middle ear space. Preoperative audiometry showed a mean air-bone gap of 30 decibels. 69% of the ears had ossicular osteolysis. The surgical technique was decided at the time of surgery. This was most often a canal-wall-up procedure which was almost routinely followed by surgical revision (92%). Pearl-like masses or recurrent cholesteatoma were frequently found at the second or third operation (73%) but most could ultimately be controlled with a canal-wall-up procedure. A canal-wall-up down procedure was necessary in 20% of the ears at either the second or third operation because of important residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. Post-operative audiometry showed a mean air-bone gap of 30 decibels.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy: canal wall up procedures
AB  - Management of the mastoid in cases of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma remains controversial. Whether to leave the canal wall up or perform a cavity technique continues to be debated. The author reviewed his personal cases of surgery for chronic otitis media over a 5-year period and studied 108 cases without prior surgery who required tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma. Thirty-two percent of the cases were in children 15 years of age and under. Over two thirds of the procedures were canal wall up, and the remainder of patients underwent a canal wall down technique with obliteration. There was little difference in the results between children and adults, with the exception of there being a tendency for a greater degree of ossicular destruction in the children and a greater incidence of residual disease at second stage surgery. There was a 3 percent incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma. It appears that the intact canal wall technique is preferable in both children and adults, when circumstances are favorable.

T1  - Long-term results of surgical treatment in different cholesteatoma types
AB  - Results of surgical treatment in different types of cholesteatoma were analyzed in 431 chronic ears. Mean follow-up period was 6.9 years. The total recurrence rate (including both residual and recurrent cholesteatoma) was 8.6 percent. The recurrence rate was lowest (7.4%) in attic cholesteatoma and highest (10.0%) in pars tensa retraction cholesteatoma. The great majority (98%) of the operations were one-stage procedures. Canal wall down mastoidectomy was the procedure in 297 cases, with a recurrence rate of 7.7 percent; canal wall up mastoidectomy, in 86 cases, yielded a recurrence rate of 9.3 percent, and in 48 ears the cholesteatoma was removed by a transcanal procedure without mastoidectomy, giving a recurrence rate of 12.5 percent. Hearing results in attic and sinus cholesteatoma were significantly better than in pars tensa retraction cholesteatoma. Of the whole series, hearing improved in 36 percent and deteriorated in 28 percent. It is concluded that surgery should be individualized according to site and size of the cholesteatoma, but all large cholesteatomas require canal wall down procedure to avoid recurrence.

T1  - Surgery for recurrent and residual cholesteatoma
AB  - One hundred twelve patients (116 ears) were treated for recurrent and residual cholesteatoma. A retrospective review revealed that 66% had undergone canal wall down mastoidectomy at the previous surgery. The surgical procedure at revision was selected on the basis of an intraoperative assessment of the extent of disease, and clinical prediction of eustachian tube function. The average period of follow-up was 3.4 years. Revision surgery was successful in providing the patient with a safe, dry ear in 105 (91%) of 116 cases. Surgical principles and hearing results are presented.

T1  - Single-stage management of cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical management of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma can be performed in a single-stage procedure, with revision surgery necessary because of recurrent disease or electively with unsatisfactory hearing results. We retrospectively reviewed 164 cases with cholesteatoma surgically managed from 1980 through 1986. In total there were 11 tympanoplasties, 36 canal wall-up mastoidectomies, 81 canal wall down modified radical mastoidectomies, and 36 radical mastoidectomies. The recidivistic rate for cholesteatoma in patients available for 5-year followup was 11% for tympanoplasties, 19% for canal wall-up mastoidectomies, 5% for canal wall-down modified radical mastoidectomies, and 0% for radical mastoidectomies. Hearing results were best in patients who required tympanoplasty alone, followed by those who underwent canal wall-down procedures. Single-stage management of cholesteatoma with modified radical mastoidectomy (canal wall-down) required fewer revisions for recidivistic cholesteatoma and achieved better hearing results than canal wall-up procedures. We conclude, therefore, that staging is not necessary. Improved hearing may likely be achieved with a second procedure, but this is at the patient's discretion.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children
AB  - This is a retrospective review of 71 patients charts, over a 10-year period, with the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. An analysis included the demographic data, audiological data and surgical results. The selection of the surgical technique depended on the extent of the disease. In the majority of cases the primary procedure was of the canal wall down technique, which is contrary to most recently published reports. Most of the cholesteatomas were extensive, thereby requiring a more aggressive surgical approach. It was our opinion that the extent of the disease in a child was greater than in an adult. Another feature found in children is the occurrence of the disease behind an intact tympanic membrane. In this review, 35% of the cases presented in this manner. Hearing was maintained or improved in the majority of cases. It is concluded that cholesteatoma in children may differ from that in the adult and that even with canal wall down procedures, maintenance or improvement of hearing is achieved in most patients.

T1  - Reconstruction of radical mastoidectomy by obliteration technique
AB  - Reconstruction of radical mastoidectomy was performed by obliteration tympanoplasty using Palva flap in 199 ears either in one stage (normal mucosa, normal stapes, no risk of residual cholesteatoma behind the flap) or in two stages. At the 2nd stage, middle ear was reopened and the posterior cavity was checked in 34 cases. Bony pate or ceramic granules may be added behind the flap, especially at this second stage. The closure of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 97% of cases. Residual cholesteatoma was removed in the middle ear at the 2nd stage in 17% of the ears. Late residual cholesteatoma behind the flap appeared in 5 cases where the posterior cavity had not been checked. Three early retraction pockets were due to technical failures which were more recently corrected by the use of fibromuscular graft placed between the fascia graft an the Palva flap. Three late retraction pockets progressed under the tympanic membrane from above to below. Hearing results were better in the 1st stage procedures, obviously selected: ABG within 20 dB in 83% of the ears with a normal stapes. On the contrary, in 2 stage procedures, ABG within 20 dB was achieved only in 50% of cases with a normal stapes and 29% of the ears where the crura were missing.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: a comparison of three techniques
AB  - The debate regarding the surgical technique for the management of cholesteatoma still continues. The resolution of this issue will only come with the study of the long term results of well controlled series. In this paper long term follow-up on three groups of patients is reported. The groups underwent combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT), mastoid tympanoplasty with obliteration (MOT), and modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) respectively for cholesteatoma. The factors studied included frequency of required review, condition of the external canal/cavity, and hearing status. The meatal cross-sectional areas and cavity volumes were also measured for the MRM and MOT groups. Analysis of the data showed no significant difference between the groups in either frequency of review or cavity status. The hearing results showed an initial improvement in all groups, however, over the prolonged follow-up period the air conduction threshold gradually increased. In conclusion this data supports the view that a one-stage canal wall down procedure provides maximum long term patient benefit.

T1  - [A new external canal wall-preserving method for aural cholesteatoma surgery--the osteocutaneous flap]
AB  - There are three major results of successful aural cholesteatoma surgery. They are called cavity opened, cavity obliterated and cavity closed (Table 1). Cavity opened or cavity closed, call for the use of canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU), respectively. With an obliterated cavity, either the canal wall down or canal wall up method may be used. An intermediate form for management of the canal wall is called temporary CWD and two methods of this form have been used. One is the temporary posterosuperior canal wall resection method and the other is the one the author describes here, the osteocutaneous flap for wall preservation. The author used this method after deciding to cut down the canal wall in the case of difficult removal of cholesteatoma in the epitympanum or the middle ear recesses under the CWU procedure. In fifteen cases in the past 2 years this method has been used to complete operations which initially began with the CWU procedure. The results included short healing time, less post-operation care, fair hearing recovery and optimal conditions for a smooth and safe 2nd operation. The osteocutaneous flap method gives us one more choice in the many different methods of cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - [Infantile cholesteatoma]
AB  - We present the results obtained in a group of 52 patients (55 ears), 15 years old or younger, diagnosed with middle ear cholesteatoma. After the evaluation of their clinical records, audiometry and X ray, surgery was performed by means of canal wall up procedures in 40 ears (72%) and canal wall down procedures in 15 (27%). The cholesteatoma was eradicated in 62% of the first group and in 86% of the second one. In 17 patients there was a recurrence. In those cases of canal wall up procedures they were transformed in canal wall down, or in the canal wall down the cavity was cleaned up. Only in 2 of these 17 recurrences, there was a second recurrence. In 7 cases a tympanoplasty was performed and the audiometric GAP was reduced in 57% and only in 19% when tympanoplasty wasn't performed. [References: 37]

T1  - Late results of surgery in different cholesteatoma types
AB  - Our series of 740 cholesteatomas, operated during the period 1969 to 1980, were seen at follow-up several times with a median observation period of 9.2 years (range 3-21 years). There were; 273 attic cholesteatomas with retraction (perforation) of Shrapnell's membrane; 271 sinus cholesteatomas with superioposterior retraction (perforation) of pars tensa, and 196 tensa retraction cholesteatomas extending from a retraction of the whole pars tensa. The late results were analyzed for each type separately, and compared. The recurrence rate was lowest (6.6%) in attic cholesteatoma and highest (13.3%) in tensa retraction cholesteatoma. In all three types no residual cholesteatomas were detected after the 4th postoperative year, whereas recurrent cholesteatomas occurred up to 10 years after surgery. The reoperation rate was lowest (15%) in attic cholesteatoma and almost the same (21%) in sinus and tensa retraction cholesteatoma. The hearing results were best in attic cholesteatoma and poorest in tensa retraction cholesteatoma. It is concluded that cholesteatoma surgery should be individualized and that both the canal wall up and canal wall down methods have their place in cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric age group
AB  - The diagnosis and management of cholesteatoma in children remains controversial. In the past 15 years, the senior author (S.C.P.) has treated 320 patients with cholesteatoma. Patients 18 years and younger composed 40% (125) of the overall group and are the basis for this report. The patient data were compiled using the history, physical examination, audiograms, radiographs, patient questionnaires, surgical findings, and postoperative observations. The surgical treatment selected was determined by the extent of disease, the configuration of the mastoid, and a clinical assessment of eustachian tube function. A middle ear tympanotomy approach was used in 17% of the patients, a canal wall up procedure in 31%, and a canal wall down procedure in 52.3%. The average clinical follow-up was 3.9 years, with the range being from 3 months to 13.5 years. Hearing was maintained or slightly improved in a majority of cases. Residual disease occurred in 8% of patients, and recurrent disease in only 3%. [References: 14]

T1  - Attic cholesteatoma. Recurrence rate related to observation time
AB  - Two hundred twenty-four ears with attic cholesteatomas, subjected to one-stage surgery between 1965 and 1978, were reevaluated several times, most recently in 1980/81 at a median observation time of 8 years (range, 3 to 16 years) and in 1985/86 at a median observation time of 11 years (range, 3 to 21 years). The recurrence rate was related to length of observation time. Up to and including the follow-up examination in 1980, the rate of residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity was 1.3% and 0.9% in the attic. The incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in the attic or the cavity was 1.8%. The total recurrence rate was 4.0%. At follow-up in 1985/86, the total recurrence rate had increased to 6.3%, comprising residual cholesteatoma in the tympanic cavity in 1.8% and in the attic in 0.9% and recurrent cholesteatoma in 3.6%. A total of 133 patients had a modified canal wall up mastoidectomy, whereas 91 patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with obliteration. With regard to the total results of surgery, no significant differences could be demonstrated between the two methods, and we conclude that canal wall up mastoidectomy can be performed in one stage.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: the role of staging in closed operations
AB  - It has been proposed that closed operations on cholesteatomatous ears should be performed on a two-stage basis in order to detect disease left behind at the first operation and to correct developing retraction pockets. Two groups of patients who had closed operations performed in two stages, 100 combined approach tympanoplasties and 100 mastoid obliterations with tympanoplasty, were observed for 10 years after the second stage. A much greater than expected incidence of eventual cholesteatoma recurrence suggests that even with staging, closed techniques may provide a less than reliable outcome in surgical control of the disease, and long-term observation of ears thus treated is desirable.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: open vs closed tympanoplasty
AB  - The purpose of this report is to compare closed tympanoplasty (canal wall up) and open tympanoplasty (canal wall down) performed in ears with extensive cholesteatoma operated on and followed up during the past 11 years. The study has demonstrated that there are no significant differences between open and closed tympanoplasties in terms of both postoperative subjective problems and auditory results. The only definite difference relates to recurring cholesteatoma: canal wall-up operations are complicated by recurrence of cholesteatoma in a not insignificant number of ears and require a planned two-stage procedure in all the cases. By contrast, the postoperative clinical course of open tympanoplasties has been only rarely affected by cholesteatomatous complications. It is concluded that reduction of cholesteatoma recurrence to the greatest degree possible necessitates removal of the canal wall. Open tympanoplasty is an effective alternative for closed tympanoplasty in all cases in which there is a contraindication to preserving the canal wall and in all patients whose medical or social conditions prevent scheduling an operation in more stages.

T1  - Mastoidectomy for acquired cholesteatoma: follow-up to 20 years
AB  - The results of 423 mastoidectomies for acquired cholesteatoma were reanalyzed 6 years after the first analysis. The mastoidectomies were placed into three groups: open-cavity, 135 modified radical and 37 radical; obliterated-cavity, 60 modified radical and 20 radical in which the mastoid cavities were obliterated with pedicle muscle grafts; and intact-canal-wall, 69 complete and 102 complete with opening of the facial recess. The following observations were made. The cholesteatoma failure rate increased: for the open-cavity group, from 6% to 7%; obliterated-cavity group, 16% to 18%; intact-canal-wall group, 35% to 45%. The precholesteatoma (retraction pocket) failure rate in the open-cavity and obliterated-cavity groups did not change. In the intact-canal-wall group, recurrent cholesteatomas developed in 8 cases initially classified as precholesteatoma failures. In 9 initially classified as successful, retraction pockets developed and 7 of these went on to recurrent cholesteatomas. Consequently, despite the progressive increase in formation of retraction pockets, the overall incidence dropped from 20% to 16%. Failure due to chronic or frequent recurrent infection did not change in the open-cavity and intact-canal-wall groups. However, in the obliterated-cavity group, it increased from 4% to 5%. The overall failure rate increased: open-cavity group, 18% to 19%; obliterated-cavity group, 29% to 30%; intact-canal-wall group, 60% to 66%.

AB  - One hundred fifty-seven ears treated surgically for chronic mastoiditis with cholesteatoma are reviewed. The selection of an operative procedure ("canal wall up" or "canal wall down") was dictated by the extent of pathologic indications in relation to the size of the patient's mastoid. The incidence of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, the hearing results, and the frequency of visits required for mastoid cavity care are reported.

T1  - Assessment of postoperative hearing in 528 middle ear and mastoid surgery cases in Tokai University Hospital
AB  - The postoperative hearing results in cases of tympanoplasty, radical mastoidectomy, modified radical mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty combined with modified radical mastoidectomy on 528 ears, performed in the Tokai University Hospital between 1975 and 1980 were assessed. The assessment was based on pure-tone audiograms taken 3 months to 5 years after the operation. Out of 528 cases 70.5% gained better postoperative hearing, 6% showed no change of hearing and 23.5% showed deterioration of hearing. Auditory success of those who attained social hearing, air-bone gap closure to within 20dB or gained hearing of 20 dB or more was 53.4%. The results in cholesteatoma cases were poorer than those of non-cholesteatoma cases. In 44% of the cases, ossiculoplasty was performed, and the most successful ossiculoplasty results were obtained when the malleus was repositioned to the head of the stapes. Fairly good results were achieved when an artificial prosthesis, such as a Teflon-piston, Gelfoam-wire or platinum-piston, was used. The least successful results were found when the incus was transpositioned. In the non-ossiculoplasty group, type I tympanoplasty produced 59.5% auditory success whereas 37.3% auditory success was achieved in radical mastoidectomy. Better auditory success rates were obtained when the bony bridge was preserved than when it was removed. The results were identical in cases where the mastoid cavity was obliterated or when it was kept open. A new technique, "scutumplasty", was used for reconstructing the scutum. Revision surgery was required in only 3.4% of the cases.

T1  - Postoperative cholesteatoma: are claims for the canal wall down technique justified?
AB  - To discover whether removal of the canal wall would reduce the incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma in tympanoplasty, the findings in staged, intact canal wall tympanoplasties were compared with those in staged, modified radical mastoidectomies with cavity obliteration and tympanoplasty. In all, cholesteatoma was considered totally removed at the first operation. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was not significantly different in either group. It is concluded that staging in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma is mandatory.

T1  - Five-year postoperative outcomes of modified staged canal wall up tympanoplasty for primary acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: For successful canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT) for the treatment of cholesteatoma, the restoration of stable middle ear aeration is also important; however, little is known about the dynamics of such aeration or the optimal surgical procedure. In this study, alternative additional surgical procedure was selected based on the grade of middle ear aeration during the second-stage operation. Subjects and methods: Patients included in this study underwent staged CWUT surgeries with mastoid cortex plasty (MCP) for well-aerated ears (grade 3) and bony mastoid obliteration (BMO) for poorly aerated ears (grade 2-0). Of the 115 ears included in this study, 62 were followed for more than 5 years. Recurrence rates with deep retraction pocket formation were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The aeration was graded as: 0, no aeration; 1, aeration of only the mesotympanum; 2, aeration of the entire tympanic cavity; and 3, aeration of both the tympanic and mastoid cavities. Result(s): No recurrence was observed in ears associated with grade 3 aeration that underwent MCP or in ears with grade 2 aeration that underwent BMO during second-stage surgery. For grades 0 and 1 aeration ears, the recurrence rates were 8.1% after 5 years and 12.5% after 10 years (p < 0.05), and the aeration of recurrent ears deteriorated to grade 0. Conclusion(s): Aeration during second-stage surgery predicts the final outcome.Copyright © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

T1  - Anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration with bioactive glass s53p4: a prospective clinical study
AB  - Objective: To analyse the anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results when using bioactive glass in mastoid and epitympanic obliteration. Design(s): Prospective clinical study. Setting(s): Tertiary referral centre. Participant(s): Forty-one cases (39 patients) operated between May 2013 and January 2015. Main Outcome Measure(s): Anatomical results were evaluated by otomicroscopy 1 year after surgery and using imaging to detect residual disease. Functional results were studied by postoperative hearing gain. Quality of life was assessed with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire and the success of surgery by a surgery-specific questionnaire. Result(s): At 1 year, all patients presented a well-healed external auditory canal, with an intact tympanic membrane. In cases with cholesteatoma (n = 23), no recurrent retraction pockets or residual disease were observed on imaging studies. The overall air-bone gap closure was 7.7 +/- 1.84 dB (mean +/- se of the mean, P < 0.001, paired t-test). No significant differences were found on hearing results when comparing primary versus revision surgery, canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down obliterations, type of tympanoplasty and presence of cholesteatoma (multifactor anova). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory improved with an average score of 28 and the success of surgery questionnaire showed a significant improvement in ear discharge and a moderate improvement in hearing and equilibrium. Conclusion(s): The use of bioactive glass for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal-wall-down or canal-wall-up tympanoplasties is an effective procedure in both primary and revision surgery. The anatomical and functional results appear to be well correlated with patient experience and to the improvement in quality of life.Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

T1  - Hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess hearing outcome after sequential cholesteatoma surgery stratified for exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal and transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery (CWD) and to analyze the impact of ossicular reconstruction technique (partial ossicular replacement prostheses/PORP and total ossicular replacement prostheses/TORP) on hearing outcome. This study is a retrospective case review and clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. Patients who underwent 376 cholesteatoma surgeries (2007-2009) and 92 ears in clinical re-examination at least 12 months postoperatively were included. Sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM, or CWD; ossiculoplasty with PORP or TORP were the interventions administered. Pre- and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and air conduction threshold (AC) for 0.5-3 kHz were the main outcome measures. Overall, the mean preoperative ABG decreased from 25.3 +/- 1.3 to 19.8 +/- 0.9 dB with a mean ABG closure of 5.4 +/- 1.3 dB (p <= 0.001). According to surgical technique, the postoperative ABG after CWD 23.5 +/- 2.1 was significantly worse compared to ETC (17.3 +/- 1.0 dB, p < 0.05) and TCM (19.4 +/- 1.3 dB). A significant ABG closure was observed after ETC (6.8 +/- 2.0 dB, p < 0.01) and TCM (6.5 +/- 2.0 dB, p < 0.01) contrary to CWD (2.1 +/- 2.9 dB, p > 0.05). Patients receiving PORP showed a significantly less ABG postoperatively (19.0 +/- 0.9 dB, p <= 0.05) compared to the TORP group (24.1 +/- 2.5 dB). However, a significant hearing gain was assessed after PORP- (4.7 +/- 1.6 dB, p <= 0.01) and TORP- implantation (10.4 +/- 3.7 dB, p <= 0.01). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery allowed for an excellent hearing outcome postoperatively. An intact posterior canal wall and a present stapes suprastructure were identified to predict a significantly superior hearing result. In addition to the technical and prosthetic considerations, the audiological outcome was confounded by the attending middle ear pathology.Copyright © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

T1  - Predictive factors for recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: To enhance understanding of the factors which contribute to development of recurrent cholesteatoma in children as part of the Round Table session on Paediatric Cholesteatoma. Predictive factors for recurrent cholesteatoma Recurrent cholesteatoma (i.e. development of new disease after previous surgical clearance) may be a consequence of persistent pathogenetic factors and perhaps also of surgical technique. Cholesteatoma is commonly considered to behave more aggressively in children than adults. A clear understanding of factors that predispose to recurrent disease in children may help selection of optimal surgical technique for disease control for example between canal wall up (CWU) or down (CWD) and mastoid preservation or obliteration. In an attempt to clarify this relationship between disease, patient and surgery, a single-surgeon prospective database of consecutive cholesteatoma surgeries was analysed. Analysis was restricted to cases with no prior history of cholesteatoma surgery. Out of 368 paediatric cases, 328 (89%) were completed with CWU of which 69 were totally endoscopic (TEES), and 40 were completed with CWD of which 10 had primary obliteration. Overall 34 (9%) were found to develop recurrent cholesteatoma. Kaplan Meier survival (KM) analysis was used to control for the cumulative increase in recurrence with time, giving an overall recurrence rate of 12% at 5 years and 18% at 10 years. Perhaps surprisingly, KM analysis suggests that gender and younger age had no impact on likelihood of recurrence. Similarly the same rate of recurrence was found for congenital and acquired cholesteatoma and whether disease was acquired from pars tensa or pars flaccida retraction. The most significant pre-operative determinant of outcome was extent of cholesteatoma, with cholesteatoma involving 4 sub-sites (meso-and epitympanum, antrum and mastoid) having significantly greater risk of recurrence than smaller disease (30% at 5 years; KM log rank statistic p = 0.002). While canal wall down surgery (CWD) is commonly considered to have a lower risk of recurrence than intact canal wall surgery (CWU), in this series, KM analysis showed no difference in rate of recurrent cholesteatoma between these different techniques. Subgroup analysis, in which the sample sizes are small, suggests (a) the same recurrence rate with TEES and (b) no difference in revision surgery for uncontrolled disease for CWD cases with or without obliteration of the mastoid. In contrast to the perhaps unreachable gold-standard of a randomized prospective trial to control for differences between patients, it must be noted that selection of surgical technique was allocated according to patient and disease factors, for example CWD surgery was used more often for larger cholesteatoma. Careful recording and analysis of surgical intervention and outcome provides valuable insight into the effectiveness of otologic intervention for cholesteatoma. Survival analysis is required to control for the increasing incidence with longer follow up. It is also important to control for other risk factors such as the extent of cholesteatoma. Understanding of the mechanisms of recurrent cholesteatoma is confounded by selection of surgical technique according to the extent of disease. Nevertheless, as it seems that "Bad ears do badly and good ears do well" it is arguably most important maximise strategies to prevent recurrent disease in those thought to be most at risk.

T1  - The selection of surgical technique for middle ear cholesteatoma in pediatric patients
AB  - Learning Objectives: Method: A retrospective analysis of all cases of pediatric primary acquired cholesteatoma aged 6-14 years old between May, 2005 and August, 2009 was conducted. 86 patients(89 ears) were treated and followed from 1 to 7 years[ the average is (3.8 +/- 2.5) years]. Result(s): During the follow-up, intact canal wall mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty(ICW) was the primary surgical treatment in 38 patients(38 ears) initially, the recidivism rate was 18%(7/38), 48 patients(51 ears) underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty(CWD), the recidivism rate was 6%(3/51), the achieved rate of PTA was 68%(35/51). Conclusion(s): ICWhad the advantage which could preserve the physical structure of external auditory canal, however, the cholesteatomas in pediatric patients are more wide spread and erosive. The surgery should completely remove the diseased tissues and then preserve the hearing. Surgical techniques should be depending on the lesions extension, generally the tympanoplasty with open technique was more suitable. Objective(s): To discuss the best strategy in surgical treatment for middle ear cholesteatoma in pediatric patients.

T1  - Hearing in patients with cholesteatoma: Facing reality
AB  - Learning Objectives: to confront the otologic community with the non-optimal hearing of individuals with controlled cholesteatoma. Introduction: Goals of management in cholesteatoma are to create a safe ear (avoiding complications), to achieve a dry and convenient ear and to reach the best possible hearing restoration. Although hearing restoration is not defined as the first priority for treatment in cholesteatoma, it may have serious long-term effects on patient's life. Method(s): The study included two study groups. In one group there were 260 consecutive cholesteatoma surgeries, 128 adults and 132 children . The mean group follow-up was 6.6 +/- 12.8 yrs. Hearing thresholds were analyzed according to type of surgery performed and age of the patients (children Vs adults). The other group includes 39 ears of children who were operated after the introduction of routine use of none EPI-diffusion weighted MRI and the complete avoidance of traditional radical cavities. In this group follow up was much shorter (Mean 1.4 +/- 1.3 yrs.) Results: Mean group air conduction (AC) PTA after canal wall up procedures were 38 dB in children and 55 dB in adults. Mean group AC-PTA after canal wall down procedures were 70 dB in children and 60 dB in adults. Group AC-PTA after canal wall up procedures were 38 dB in children and 55 dB in adults. In the group with radical mastoidectomy and reconstruction of the EEC and mastoid obliteration mean group AC-PTA was 40 dB as compared to 60 dB in the canal wall down cases which were left as radical cavities. Conclusion(s): The mean AC-PTA of ears with controlled cholesteatoma indicates that hearing is unsatisfactory in many of the individuals with controlled cholesteatoma. When it is evident that hearing is not within normal thresholds (whether ossiculoplasty was performed or not) all relevant rehabilitation options should be offered to the patients, including conventional hearing aids, bone conduction systems, middle ear implants or cochlear implants.

T1  - Postoperative residual cases in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: Acquired cholesteatoma is more aggressive in children than in adults. Despite the aggressive behaviour, radical treatment such as canal wall down technique was less performed to reduce cavity problem which requires endless care. This results in high rate of residues and recurrence. We focused in this study on reducing residues in pediatric acquired cholesteatoma surgery and explored risk factors of residual lesions. Method(s): Medical charts of 39 children under 15 years old with acquired cholesteatoma were retrospectively reviewed. Various factors were compared between the residual cholesteatoma ( + ) and (-) groups: surgical procedures, type of cholesteatoma, number of primary sites of cholesteatoma at surgery (P, protympanum; T, tympanic cavity; A, attic; M, mastoid), development of mastoid air cells, and the status of stapes. Residue ( + ) was defined if residual lesion was found after one-stage surgery or planned two-stage surgery, but not during second-look operation. Result(s): Residual cholesteatoma was found ten out of 39 ears (25.6%). Residual sites including overlaps were mastoid cavity (n = 7) followed by tympanic cavity (n = 6) and attic (n = 4), which is different from adult acquired cholesteatoma where the tympanic cavity such as tympanic sinus is the most likely area of residues. Among the various factors examined, significant differences were found between the residue (+) and (-) groups: multiple primary sites such as TAM and PTAM diseases and poor status of stapes were more seen in residue (+) group. Conclusion(s): Residual cholesteatoma was mostly seen in mastoid cavity, probably because small piece of epithelium remains in honeycomb structure of well-developing mastoid cavity, which is a characteristic feature of mastoid in children. In order to minimize the residual lesion, surgeons should take care of complete removal of mastoid cholesteatoma especially in patients with advanced case such as multiple primary sites and with invasion to stapes.

T1  - Incidence of mastoidectomy among cholesteatoma patients in Denmark
AB  - Objective: 1) To describe the incidence rate of first-time surgically treated middle ear cholesteatoma (STMEC1) in Denmark 1977-2015 and to estimate the proportion undergoing mastoidectomy. 2) To describe the recurrence rate after STMEC1 on Funen 1982-2015 taking surgical approach into consideration. Method(s): Cases of STMEC1 were identified by the use of the Danish National Hospital Register which also provided data on mastoidectomy. A change in incidence rate over time was examined using Poisson regression analysis. For STMEC1s on Funen, the medical records were reviewed. The rate of recurrence was analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method and Cox regression analysis. Result(s): A total of 16,475 STMEC1s were identified. Of these 4,416 (27%) were children (<16 years of age) and 12,059 (73%) were adults. The incidence rate of STEM1 in adults was stable at 6-7 per 100,000 person years for the last couple of decades. In children the incidence rate fell from 15 per 100,000 person years in 2002 to 7 per 100,000 person years in 2015. The proportion undergoing mastoidectomy was stable (53% in children and 58% in adults). The medical records from 1,003 patients with cholesteatoma (1,056 ears) were reviewed. The overall proportion of ears with recurrence was 38% in children and 14% in adults 5 years after primary surgery. Individuals without the need of mastoidectomy were at lowest risk of recurrence while individuals undergoing canal wall up (CWU) without obliteration had the highest risk of recurrence (58% in children and 20% in adults after 5 years). In children, CWU without obliteration was associated with a hazard ratio for recurrence of 1.9 (95% 1.2-3.0) when compared with CWU with obliteration. Conclusion(s): The incidence rate of STMEC1 in children halved from 2002 to 2015. Compared with adults, children were at an increased risk of recurrence. In children treated with CWU, obliteration was associated with a significantly lower risk of recurrence compared with no obliteration.

T1  - Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma: Criteria for the selection of the surgical technique
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: The surgical technique in cholesteatoma is decided on the bases of the following criteria: 1.-Anatomical characteristics of the mastoid. 2.-Clinical type of cholesteatoma: Congenital. Primary acquired. Secondary acquired. 3.-Surgical type of cholesteatoma: Encapsulated and non-encapsulated. 4.-The estate of the mucose membrane. Absent, cholesterol granuloma, polyps in the middle ear, etc.. 5.-Extension of the cholesteatoma. Material(s) and Method(s): The above described criteria is revised in 380 consecutively operated. The different techniques and their results are described. At present the most frequent technique is Intact Canal Wall tympanoplasty (210 ICW, 60%) followed by different types of Canal Wall Down (140 CWD 40%) tympanoplasties. In 350 (92%) a tympanoplasty was performed. The incidence of Radical Mastoidectomies (RM), middle ear exclusion (MEE) and Subtotal petrosectomies (STP) are very infrequent (8%) and are performed mostly in revision surgery in cases with a failure of CWD tympanoplasty. Result(s): The failures are subdivided in recurrent and residual cholesteatoma: We have five percent of recurrent cholesteatoma in the adult and eight percent in children. In 20% of the cases there is a residual cholesteatoma. Only 2% of them in CWD tympanoplasty, RM, MEE or STP. The hearing results can be summarized saying that in 60% of the patients there is useful hearing without the need for a hearing aid. These results are closely related to the technique used for surgery. Conclusion(s): Adequate selection of the surgical technique for each individual case is the first goal to obtain best results both to minimize recurrences and to obtain the best possible hearing results. There is not a surgical technique that is best for all cases. Diffusion MRI is very useful to follow cases of MEE and STP and has made us to indicate these techniques more often.

T1  - The results of obliteration technique in canal wall up and wall down tympanomastoidectomy in patients with acquired middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: Introduction: The objective in the surgical management of acquired middle ear cholesteatoma is eradication of disease and the creation of a dry, safe ear. For reducing of incidence of frequent cleaning need after CWD, as well as for control of reretraction of tympanic membrane after CWU tympanomastoidectomy, mastoid obliteration is preferable for many otological surgeons. Material(s) and Method(s): 50 patients (16 to 65 y.o.) with cholesteatoma have been observed in this work. 34 ears have extensive cholesteatoma with erosion of posterior bony wall of ear canal. In 12 patients cholesteatoma involves only epitympanum, in 4-hole tympanic cavity. Posterior canal wall erosion due to cholesteatoma was indentified as the primary indication for radical mastoidectomy. Most patients mentioned periodic, only 7 of them-persistent otorrhea. All patients had conductive to mixed hearing loss with ABG more than 25 dB. 34 patients were undergone CWD, 16 CWU tympanomastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration using of bone pate' from the cortical layer of mastoid. Temporalis fascia has been used for tympanic membrane grafting and for covering of mastoid cavity filling with bone pate'. Tragal cartilage has been used in 27 patients for placement between the head of the stapes and fascia. In cases of cholesteatoma in the oval window area, ossiculoplasty is postponed for second look surgery. Result(s): Among the 50 patients 42(84%) grafts healed. In 5(10%) patients cholesteatoma developed during 3 years after the surgery. In 3(6%) patients reperforation occurred without cholesteatoma. Conclusion(s): The mastoidectomy with tympanic membrane grafting and mastoid obliteration provides eradication of disease, prevents reretraction of tympanic membrane in patients with middle ear cholesteatoma. The results of surgery are good basis for the second stage-ossiculoplasty with hearing improvement.

T1  - Long term functional and hearing outcomes of surgery in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Learning Objectives: The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the functional and hearing outcomes of surgery for cholesteatoma in pediatric population. Study Design: Retrospective study Setting: Gruppo Otologico, a quarternary referral center for Otology and Skull Base Surgery in Italy. Material(s) and Method(s): A retrospective analysis is presented of 664 cases of cholesteatoma in pediatric population who were treated by surgery. The surgical approach was chosen according to the hearing loss, symptoms, status of tympanic membrane and radiological finding. Surgical procedures included Canal Wall Down mastoidectomies, Modified Bondy mastoidectomies, Canal Wall Up mastoidectomies, Radical mastoidectomies, revision surgeries and Subtotal Petrosectomies. In some of these patients additional procedure included Cochlear Implants or Boneanchored hearing aids. Charts were analysed for type of cholesteatoma, surgical procedures, hearing results, recurrence and follow up. Result(s): Charts of 664 patients were analysed. Of these patients, 39% underwent CWD surgery, 38% CWU surgery, 4.9% CWD with Bondy's technique, 4.3% radical CWD, 0.75% subtotal petrosectomy and 13% of patients underwent a revision tympanoplasty. For long-term functional and hearing outcomes, 552 patients with a follow-up of > 1 year were analyzed separately. Our experience shows an incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma of 19% during 10 years of follow up. In most of these cases CWU procedure was converted into a CWD mastoidectomy. Hearing results will be discussed upon presentation. Conclusion(s): Surgery for cholesteatoma is especially challenging in a pediatric population because of the need for hearing preservation. Hence canal wall up mastoidectomy in a single or two stages should be the approach of choice in the pediatric population. The modified Bondy technique is a very useful hearing preservation procedure in limited epitympanic cholesteatomas. Radiological follow-up by DWI is mandatory in children for more than 5 years as recurrences can be seen even after 5 years.

T1  - Managment of pediatric cholesteatoma: The gruppo otologico experience in the management of 618 cases
AB  - Learning Objectives: Management of pediatric cholesteatoma and the long term outcomes of canal wall up mastoidectomy. The objectiveof this study is to report the Gruppo Otologico experience in the surgical treatment of paediatric cholesteatoma. This is a retrospective study wherein 572 charts of young patients who underwent surgery between 1983 and 2015 were analysed. 46 patients had bilateral disease and the average age was 10.6 years old. The extension of cholesteatoma was defined using Sanna and Zini's cholesteatoma classification. The most commonly surgical procedure used in children were Canal Wall Up and a Canal Wall Down tympanoplasty. Canal Wall Up Tympanoplasty (CWU) was performed in 263 patients, while, Canal Wall Down Tympanoplasty (CWD) that includes Modified Bondy Technique (BT) and Radical Mastoidectomy (RM), was used in 258 patients. Thereweremore numbers of revision surgeries in CWU (34%) than CWD (10%) tympanoplasty. In all surgeries put together, we had an improvement of hearing of a mean of 8.5 dB HL. Themean follow-up was 10 years. In conclusion, the technique of choice for pediatric cholesteatoma is CWU tympanoplasty. However, the use of a CWD approach to surgically treat extensive cholesteatoma in children results in a low recurrence rate with a high rate of trouble-free ear in the long term.

T1  - The role of periosteum in mastoid surgery
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the importance of the integrity and pattern of the periosteal lining of the mastoid cavity in the outcome and sequel of the different types of the mastoid surgeries. Method(s): Revision mastoid surgeries (122 cases) of different kinds (both canal wall-up and canal wall-down mastoidectomies) between the years 2010 and 2015 were included. Intraoperative multiple curettages from the unhealthy-looking bone in direct relation to pathologic findings as granulations, polypi, and cholesteatoma were collected and histopathologically studied to determine the nature of the bony tissue and the status of the periosteum. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans for both revision and primary surgery for every case were evaluated whenever possible. Result(s): In all cases, periosteal problems could be detected. Periosteal layer deficiency in 1 or more areas of the mastoid cavity was present in almost all cases, and it was always replaced by granulation tissue or unhealthy bony tissue. Periostitis was suspected in 23 cases (18%), whereas osteitis of different levels of severities was suspected in 69 cases (57%). Sclerotic and diploic cellularity types of mastoid were mostly affected. In addition, when the primary surgery was performed in cellular mastoid, these pathologic findings were very minimal. Conclusion(s): Healthy integral periosteal lining of the mastoid cavity seems to be an essential factor for the cavity stability and surgery outcome. Detailed understanding of the mastoid cavity development, anatomy, and histology together with the studying of the preoperative CT scans helps in preserving the integrity of the cavity periosteum during surgery.

T1  - Which technique is better for cholesteatoma surgery?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term surgical outcomes and recurrence rates of three surgical techniques that are commonly used for cholesteatoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The hospital records of 132 patients with primary cholesteatoma who underwent surgery between January 1996 and December 2006 were evaluated retrospectively. Twelve cases had bilateral disease, and a total of 144 ears were treated. The patients were divided into three groups according to surgical technique: modified radical mastoidectomy (MRM) (n = 48 ears), radical mastoidectomy (RM) (n = 42 ears), and intact canal wall mastoidectomy (ICWM) (n = 54 ears). MRM and RM procedures are canal wall down (CWD) techniques, whereas the ICWM procedure is a canal wall up (CWU) technique. Postoperatively, all patients were followed up yearly for at least 6 years. The otomicroscopic features, cholesteatoma extension, surgical findings, and recurrence rates were compared in the groups. RESULTS: Preoperative otomicroscopic examination showed attic retraction or perforation in 32% of the cases and central perforation in 11%. There was a higher cholesteatoma recurrence rate in the ICWM group than in the MRM and RM groups (p < 0.05), but there was also better hearing gain in the ICWM group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There are several surgical techniques for eradicating cholesteatoma. Our study found that CWD procedures (RM, MRM) were more effective for the eradication of cholesteatoma, but hearing gain was better when a CWU technique was used. The choice of surgical technique should be individually tailored based on the pre-operative imaging and hearing examination findings.

T1  - Effectiveness of MESNA on the success of cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - Importance It is important that chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma be treated successfully in patients to protect them from having repeated surgeries with related surgical co-morbidities and hearing loss. Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of MESNA usage on the residual cholesteatoma rates of the patients who underwent surgery due to chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Design Retrospective single-institution study of a prospectively collected database. Setting Tertiary University Hospital. Participants Nine hundred and thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to chronic otitis media between September 2000 and March 2012 by the same surgeon. One hundred and forty-one cases out of 934 patients were selected who had cholesteatoma for the study. These randomly selected 141 cases were divided into two groups as follows: I. Forty-six cases were applied MESNA (Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) intraoperatively, and II. Ninety-five cases were not applied MESNA intraoperatively. The cases that were followed-up at least one year were included in this study. Intervention MESNA (Ureomitexan, MESNA, Baxter oncology, Germany) was diluted with saline (20% MESNA and 80% saline) that was applied, and then a waiting period of approximately 5 min followed to start to dissect cholesteatoma matrix. Main outcomes and measures Residual cholesteatoma rates between intraoperative MESNA, a disulfide bond breaking chemical agent, applied and MESNA non-applied cases in the postoperative follow-up period were compared for the success of the surgery. Results MESNA was used in 46 patients out of 141 cases intraoperatively. Twenty-four of these patients underwent CWD (canal wall down), and twenty-two patients underwent CWU (canal wall up) mastoidectomy. For the other 95 subjects, 56 patients with CWD and 39 with CWU mastoidectomy, MESNA was not applied. Residual cholesteatoma rates were found to be significantly higher in MESNA non-applied group than MESNA applied group (p < 0.05). Residual cholesteatoma rates between CWD and CWU mastoidectomy procedures were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions and relevance MESNA application that breaks disulfide bonds in the structure of the matrix in cholesteatoma surgery may assist the elimination of the disease, and increase surgical success by facilitating the elevation of the epithelium. Thereby, it causes a decrease in the possibility of remaining residual epithelium after surgery, which decreases the need for second-look surgery.

T1  - Relationship between tympanic membrane retraction and habitual sniffing in patients with cholesteatoma
AB  - Conclusion: Habitual sniffing affects the pathogenicity and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Postoperative instructions requesting patients to cease sniffing may reduce the retraction and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Objective(s): To examine the relationship between tympanic membrane retraction and habitual sniffing in patients with cholesteatoma. Method(s): We recruited 98 patients (102 ears) who were surgically treated for cholesteatoma by canal wall-down tympanoplasty (22 ears) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty with reconstruction methods (80 ears). We classified these patients into two groups on the basis of their preoperative habitual sniffing: habitual and non-habitual sniffers. The findings of the contralateral tympanic membrane were examined in each group and were classified according to the Tos classifications. Next, we evaluated the incidence of 1-year postoperative tympanic membrane retraction treated by the canal-down tympanoplasty with reconstruction method in the following three groups: non-habitual sniffing group, sniffing cessation group, and continual sniffing group. Result(s): In habitual sniffers, the Tos classifications of contralateral tympanic membrane were normal in 7% (3/41). In contrast, for non-habitual sniffers, the findings were normal in 39% (21/54). These results indicate that sniffing causes tympanic membrane retraction. The tympanic membranes of patients in the sniffing cessation group were largely normal after surgery. However, more than 50% of the patients who continued to sniff after surgery showed retraction or recurrent cholesteatoma. © Informa Healthcare.

T1  - The pros and cons of canal wall up versus canal wall down mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - There has been fierce debate regarding the optimal surgical technique for the management of cholesteatoma for over 50 years. Choice of technique depends on factors relating to the surgeon, the patient and the disease process. Much literature has been devoted to the benefits and pitfalls of canal wall up and canal wall down techniques and their respective effects on measures such as number of operations required for disease eradication, adequate surgical access, complications, residual/recurrent cholesteatoma, hearing outcomes and long-term follow up. This article aims to review the pros and cons of canal wall up versus canal wall down surgery for cholesteatoma.Copyright © 2013 Rila Publications Ltd.

T1  - The importance of modified techniques of tympanoplasty in the surgical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma. [Bosnian]
AB  - Objective. In order to achieve better postoperative results, lower incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, to overcome a problem of so-called "open mastoid cavity" and to improve auditory function, oto-surgeons apply various modifications of two basic techniques of the tympanoplasty: open (canal wall down-CDW) and closed (canal wall up- CWU). Methods. The total of 100 patients were surgically treated for chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma in the period from 1998 to 2008 at the Clinic of Ear, Throat and Nose Diseases of the University Clinical Centre Banja Luka. Modified approach of the stated techniques of tympanoplasty with the obliteration of the mastoid cavity and reconstruction of the posterior upper wall of the ear canal was applied. Results. Based on the results obtained, we have concluded that the incidence of the recurrent cholesteatoma significantly decreased (5.88%) in patients with whom open technique with the obliteration of the mastoid cavity and reconstruction of the posterior upper wall of the ear canal was applied. Functional results in three patient groups did not significantly differ statistically. An adequate surgical technique should be applied based on clinical and intraoperative findings. Conlusion. Surgical treatment of chronic suppurative otitis with cholesteatoma due to biological characteristics of cholesteatoma and complex anatomy of the temporal bone still represents a great otosurgical challenge.

T1  - Long-term safety of tympanomastoid obliteration for children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears
AB  - Objectives: Analyze long-term prognosis and safety in children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears following tympanomastoidectomy with cartilage obliteration. Method(s): During a 30-year period (1982-2012), the medical records of children (<=18 years) with cholesteatomas after primary tympanomastoidectomies with cartilage obliteration were analyzed. The recidivism rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Potential predictors of recidivism were entered into a Cox's regression model as covariates for multivariate analysis. These factors were sex, tympanomastoid obliteration, eardrum perforation, ossicular destruction, facial nerve dehiscence, history of ventilation tube insertion, craniofacial abnormality, surgical technique, and extent of disease. Result(s): Among a total of 150 cholesteatomatous ears in 146 children, there were 95 discharging ears (63%) in 94 children. Among the 95 discharging ears, tympanomastoidectomy was performed with cartilage obliteration (CO group) in 77 ears (81%) and without cartilage obliteration (WO group) in 18 ears (19%). The mean follow-up period was 11.6 +/- 8.1 years. Recidivism was observed in 16 years in the CO group (12 recurrent and 4 residual) and 4 in the WO group (2 recurrent and 2 residual). The 10-year cumulative recidivism rates were comparable between CO and WO groups (19% vs. 25%, P = 0.762, log-rank). Multivariate analysis indicated that tympanomastoid obliteration was not a negative predictor of recidivism (P = 0.760), while surgical technique (canal wall up vs. down; hazard ratio = 5.86, P = 0.011) was a significant predictor. Major long-term complications were not observed. Conclusion(s): This study provides long-term evidence supporting the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of tympanomastoid cartilage obliteration for children with suppurative cholesteatomatous ears.

T1  - The correlation between presenting features and surgical outcomes in pediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Objectives: Determine how presenting features of cholesteatoma in children influence surgical outcome. Method(s): A prospective database of 319 consecutive children with cholesteatoma was analyzed to compare features of cholesteatoma at presentation with patient-focused outcome measures. Features of disease included the presence of otorrhea, hearing loss (mean 4 tone air conduction audiogram more than 30dB HL), the type and extent of cholesteatoma, and ossicular status. Outcomes included hearing threshold, number of surgeries, and canal wall preservation. Cases with cholesteatoma surgery or tympanoplasty prior to referral were excluded. Result(s): Of 200 children with cholesteatomas, 32 ears presented with congenital lesions and 178 ears presented with acquired lesions. The mean age at diagnosis was 6.6 years for congenital and 11.5 years for acquired cholesteatoma. A history of continuous otorrhea had a sensitivity of 0% for diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma and 37% for acquired. Hearing loss had a sensitivity of 57% for congenital and 72% for acquired cholesteatoma. The canal wall was preserved in 181 (86%) ears at first surgery. Mean hearing level was unchanged after surgery at 36dB HL. More extensive cholesteatoma correlated with more ossicular erosion, more canal wall down surgery, worse postoperative hearing, and more repeated surgeries (P < 0.05; multiple regression analysis). Conclusion(s): Better outcomes for children with cholesteatoma can be achieved by early identification and surgery when lesions are smaller. As cholesteatoma can be relatively silent in children, without otorrhea or hearing loss. Physicians must be trained to identify otoscopic features of congenital and acquired cholesteatoma and initiate prompt referral.

T1  - Clinical analysis of 22 cases of automastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: Automastoidectomy is a destructive condition of the mastoid and middle ear cavity about which very little has been reported. 1) Know the clinical features and severities of automastoidectomy caused by chronic otitis media. 2) Evaluate the results of its surgical outcomes. Method(s): Retrospective study. Patients who visited outpatient clinic and were diagnosed with COM with automastoidectomy state by temporal bone CT from January 2003 to December 2011 were included in this study. All patients underwent surgery. Their postoperative states were evaluated at the outpatient clinic at least 6 months after surgery. Result(s): Two patients complained of facial palsy, 7 hearing disturbance, 10 otorrhea, and 3 otalgia. At physical examination, attic destruction and retracted tympanic membrane (TM) were observed in 12 patients, EAC destruction in 8, TM perforation in 4, and 1 had intact TM. All pathologic results were cholesteatoma. A total of 19 had canal wall down mastoidectomy, 2 had canal wall-up mastoidectomy, and 1 had subtotal petrosectomy. One had tympanoplasty type 1, 3 had columella over stapes head, 10 had interposition or columella over stapedial footplate and, 1 had tympanoplasty type 3. Overall hearing improvement rate was 9.0%. There was no recurrence. Conclusion(s): Automastoidectomy is a relatively rare condition of middle ear diseases. It could be caused by cholesteatomatous COM and non-cholesteatomatous COM. Hearing reconstructive procedures are generally not effective compared with other conditions. This study may be helpful to know the clinical features and surgical outcomes of this condition.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Recurrence factors
AB  - Objective: Canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is gaining popularity in the treatment for cholesteatoma. The choice remains controversial because of the significant recurrence rate of this disease. We aimed to analyze tympanomastoidectomy success rate, to establish eventual predictive factors for failure, and to evaluate the computed tomography (CT) scan's value in this pathology. Method(s): We performed a retrospective cohort study regarding all patients submitted to tympanomastoidectomy for cholesteatoma at the otolaryngology department of Hospital Sao Jose, Lisbon, from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from medical records. Result(s): One hundred nineteen patients were submitted to tympanomastoidectomy. In most cases, preoperative CT scans showed cholesteatoma in the attic (50%) and large extension of the disease (tegmen, semicircular or fallopian canal erosion in 51%), not always confirmed during surgery (75%). Sixty percent had a canal wall-down procedure. The overall postoperative air-bone gap was within 20 dB in 44%. Second-look surgery was performed in 24 patients: the overall recurrence rate was 23%, with conversion to canal wall-down procedure in 67%. Factors identified as related to failure: cholesteatoma in the sinus tympani (33%), scutum erosion (29%), and large extension of disease (40%). Conclusion(s): The recurrence rate was significant, despite the high percentage of canal wall-down procedures. Factors for failure remain uncertain and CT scans presented limited value in the diagnosis and evaluation of cholesteatoma, especially postoperatively. In the absence of better diagnostic procedures, we recommend second look surgery to control cholesteatoma's recurrence.

T1  - Clinical indications for modified radical mastoidectomy
AB  - Objective: To establish clinically derived indications for modified radical mastoidectomy in the setting of cholesteatoma. Method(s): We performed a retrospective review of 223 patients who underwent 265 operations for cholesteatoma in a single tertiary pediatric otolaryngology practice. Clinical characteristics of patients who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy were compared to those who underwent simple mastoidectomy or atticotomy. Result(s): Of the 265 procedures, 10% were modified radical mastoidectomy. Congenital cholesteatoma was more common in the the canal-wall-up group, while recurrent cholesteatoma was more common in those who had a canal-wall-down procedure. The Mills score for those who had a modified radical mastoidectomy was significantly higher than those who underwent canal-wall-up procedures (4.9 vs 3.2, P < .05). Furthermore, extremely poorly pneumatized mastoids and facial nerve dehiscence were both more common in the group who underwent modified radical mastoidectomy. Conclusion(s): Posterior wall preservation or reconstruction is possible in the large majority of cases. Severity of Mills score correlated well with the need for a canal-wall-down procedure. This was further reflected by the fact that this group had a higher incidence of facial nerve dehiscence due to cholesteatoma.

T1  - Prospective evaluation of ear and hearing status after cholesteatoma surgery in children
AB  - Introduction: The goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to achieve a safe ear, a dry ear, and to restore hearing as much as possible, while minimizing the number of surgeries. Aim(s): To evaluate long-term hearing status of patients undergoing cholesteatoma surgery in a referral otologic center. Design(s): Prospective data was collected from 43 consecutive pediatric cholesteatoma surgeries, for which complete audiometric follow up data for both ears was available. Result(s): Canal wall up mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (CWU) was performed in 16 children, 100% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 34/12.4. Canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWD) was performed in 27 children, 75% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 62.1/22.2 dB. Discussion(s): Post operative hearing loss should be taken care of as soon as possible, and it should include conventional hearing aids fitting, soft band BAHA or implantable BAHA as the standard of care. When BAHA is not a realistic rehabilitation option (patient or family refusal) a round window vibrant sound bridge (VSB) implantation should be considered.

T1  - Follow-up of middle-ear cholesteatoma surgery: Canal wall up versus canal wall down tympanoplasty
AB  - Introduction: The ideal goals of cholesteatoma surgery should be the permanent removal of disease and the preservation of good hearing function. There are no universally accepted opinions about the choise of surgical technique and autcome of surgery for cholesteatoma in different age group and localization. Material(s) and Method(s): In this study, we presented the results of 92 patients (49 males, 43 females; mean age 32 years; range 7 to 56 years) who underwent functional surgical techniques for cholesteatoma between January 2001 and January 2006. An open technique was prefered in 72% of the cases. All the patients were followed-up for at last three years. Result(s): The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techinque were 18% and 9% respectively. In all cases it was evidenced the positive effect of the stapes superstructure on hearing results. Conclusion(s): The age the patients and localization of cholesteatoma are very important factors than determinate the type of surgical procedure and the results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. A closed technique is better for younger children and for attic and sinus cholesteatoma, while in all other cases, an open technique seems more appropriate. Open technique is associated with very law incidences of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in the majority of patients. The presence of stapes superstructure positively affects hearing status indipendently for the technique used.

T1  - Chronic ear surgery in patients with syndromes and multiple congenital malformations
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The propensity for the development of chronic ear disease in patients with certain congenital syndromes is well described. Little is known about the efficacy of surgery in the management of such patients. This paper will review an institutional experience with the surgical management of chronic ear disease in patients with congenital syndromes or multiple major malformations associated with high rates of ear disease. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. METHOD(S): Charts were reviewed to identify patients diagnosed with either a congenital syndrome or multiple major malformations with a known association with the development of chronic ear disease who underwent ear surgery for chronic ear disease (excluding tympanostomy tube placement). Syndromes encountered, surgeries performed, operative outcomes, complications, and the efficacy of ossicular chain reconstruction is reported. RESULT(S): Forty-three patients with 14 different syndromes or malformations were identified. These patients underwent 66 surgical procedures on 56 ears. Seventy-nine percent of patients had undergone an ear procedure prior to presentation. Disease eradication was achieved in 64% of ears with a single procedure, and 89% of ears were controlled with two surgeries or less. Thirty-two percent of surgeries involved a canal wall down procedure, a rate similar to that seen for all patients in our practice over the past decade. When used, ossicular chain reconstruction significantly reduced the air-bone gap, resulting in hearing improvement. Results for patients with Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and conotruncal cardiac abnormalities are discussed. Only minor complications were encountered. CONCLUSION(S): Syndromic patients and those with a major congenital malformation may present with significant chronic ear disease. Appropriate surgical management can yield successful eradication of disease with low complication rates. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

T1  - Hearing results of tympanoplasty. [Japanese]
AB  - We retrospectively surveyed 43 ears operated on from April 2000 to March 2002 at St. Marianna University School of Medicine. Surgery success was analyzed using the three criteria suggested by the Japan Clinical Otology Committee in 1999. The procedure was classified as successful when the hearing level 6 months after surgery met at least one of these three conditions: 1) an air-born gap of less than 15dB, 2) a gain of more than 15dB, or 3) a hearing level above 30dB. We used the autograft cartilage for a columella for ossicular reconstruction. Success in all cases was 69.8%. In chronic otitis media, it was 87.5%. In cholesteatoma, it was 56.5%. We found no significant difference in success among canal-wall-down, canal reconstruction with mastoid obliteration and canal-wall-up tympanoplasties. Success was 81.8% for type I tympanoplasty. 70.8% for type III with columella or interposition, and 50.0% for type IV with columella or interposition.

T1  - Analysis of 100 cases of paediatric cholesteatoma
AB  - Cholesteatoma in children presents the otolaryngologist with a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Management of paediatric cholesteatoma require special skill because of the extensive spread of disease at presentation. Postoperative follow up is also difficult in paediatric age group. Here in this retrospective study 100 cases of paediatric cholesteatoma treated at ENT department, Medical College Hospital were analysed. Ossicular involvement and bony erosion by cholesteatoma were noted particularly. A single staged operative procedure - canal wall down staged operative procedure - canal wall down mastoidectomy with or without tympanoplasty was adopted in most of the cases and found to be suitable in Indian condition where postoperative follow up is difficult.

T1  - Cholesteatoma otitis media with intact ossicular chain
AB  - Thirty-one cases of cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain were reviewed to examine the extension of cholesteatoma, operation procedures, pre- and postoperative hearing levels, and postoperative condition of the ear drum. They were operated on at Departments of Hyogo College of Medicine and Osaka University Medical School from 1989-1996, which were 20.4% of all of the primary cholesteatoma cases (n = 152). Twelve cases located at attic were operated by atticotomy or canal wall up and scutumplasty, 17 cases located at attic/antrum were operated by canal wall down and reconstruction, and two cases located around stapes were operated through the ear canal. Preoperative hearing level was mild (34.2 +/- 18.4 dB)and postoperative one was slightly improved (28.7 +/- 11.2 dB). In ossicular reconstruction, modified Wullstein type III method showed better hearing gain than Wullstein type I method. Postoperative attic retraction and/or pocket occurred in 15 cases (48.4%), but no recurrent cholesteatoma was found during the present follow-up period. These findings suggested that cholesteatoma with intact ossicular chain showed good postoperative hearing results, but postoperative retraction of the ear drum should be followed up for a long time.

T1  - Surgical treatments of cholesteatoma in children. [Chinese]
AB  - Background: Cholesteatoma in children have three characteristics: more extensive, faster growth rate, more difficult to handle than in adults. We analyzed three kinds of surgical treatments in order to find which method was more effective. Method(s): This retrospective study of 55 cholesteatomatous ears in 53 children aged 16 years or less, who were treated between 1981 and 1995. We classified the surgical methods into three groups: the canal wall up (CWU), the canal wall down (CWD) with open cavity, and the canal wall down (CWD) with cartilage obliteration of open cavity. Result(s): The CWU group (10 cases): The mean post-operative hearing gain was -2 dBHL. There were 2 cases of recurrence in this group. The CWD with open cavity group (23 cases): The mean post-operative hearing gain was 2 dBHL. No recurrence in this group. The CWD with cartilage obliteration of open cavity group: The mean post-operative hearing gain was 6 dBHL. No recurrence in this group. Conclusion(s): The CWD with cartilage obliteration of cavity surgery is the method of choice for children cholesteatoma, mainly because of better hearing results and no recurrence.

T1  - A randomized, blinded study of canal wall up versus canal wall down mastoidectomy determining the differences in viewing middle ear anatomy and pathology
AB  - Hypothesis: Canal wall down and intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy represent two surgical approaches to middle ear pathology. The authors hypothesize that there is a difference in the ability to view structures in the middle ear between these two methods. Background(s): Depending on the individual, many surgeons have used the two different techniques of intact canal wall and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy for approaching the middle ear. However, opinions conflict as to which approach provides the best visualization of different locations in the middle ear. This study prospectively evaluated temporal bones to determine the differences in visualizing structures of the middle ear using these two approaches. Method(s): Twelve temporal bones underwent a standardized canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy using a reversible canal wall down technique. All bones were viewed in two dissections: intact canal wall and canal wall down preparations. Four points previously had been marked on each temporal bone in randomly assigned colors. These points include the sinus tympani, posterior crus of stapes, lateral epitympanum, and the Eustachian tube orifice. An observer blinded to the purpose of the study, color, and number of locations recorded the color and location of marks observed within the temporal bones. Randomized bones of two separate settings were viewed such that each bone was viewed in both the canal wall down and the intact canal wall preparations. Result(s): A significant difference was noted in the ability to observe middle ear pathology between the intact canal wall versus canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy, with the latter showing superiority (p < 0.001). Of the four subsites, the sinus tympani, posterior crus of stapes, and lateral epitympanum were observed more frequently with the canal wall down. There was no significant difference in the ability to observe the Eustachian tube orifice between the two techniques. Conclusion(s): Statistical analysis shows good reproducibility and randomization of this study. The canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy allowed for superior viewing of the three locations, sinus tympanic, posterior crus of stapes, and lateral at the tympanum, as they were marked in the study. This study shows the potential for improved visualization via the canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy. A significant amount of literature written by individuals and otology group practices is available retrospectively comparing the advantages and disadvantages of intact canal wall versus canal wall down mastoidectomy procedures for approaching middle ear pathology. In the interest of objectively evaluating the differences between these two approaches, we have studied temporal bones in a prospective randomized, blinded study comparing the two. Twelve bones were used and observed twice, once in each of 2 sessions. All bones were viewed in two dissections: intact canal wall and canal wall down mastoidectomy. Four points were marked on each temporal bone in three different colors applied in a randomized order to eliminate observer expectation. The four points marked include sinus tympani, posterior crus of the stapes footplate, lateral epitympanum, and Eustachian tube orifice. Both intact canal wall and canal wall down bones were provided randomly to the observer at each viewing session. Before the observer was allowed to see the dissections, those requiring replacement of the canal for the first session of the study had this done in a method using native posterior bony canal. Temporal bones were presented to an expert otologist in a randomized fashion with each temporal bone being placed in a temporal bone bowl holder and specialized framework, allowing for rotation and repositioning approximating the experience in an operating room setting. For each temporal bone, the observer filled in a questionnaire describing his or her observations by denoting both location and color of marks observed. Analysis of the results showed no significant difference between the number of observations made in the first sessi n compared to the second session, implying good randomization and no 'learning curve' for the observer from the first session to the second. In evaluating the ability to observe the four locations with the intact canal wall versus canal wall down dissection, a significant difference was noted with improved ability to identify the marks in the canal wall down bones. The sinus tympani, the posterior crus of the stapes footplate, and the lateral epitympanum were all identified more easily with the canal wall down approach. There was no significant difference in the ability to observe the marker at the Eustachian tube orifice with the canal wall up or the canal wall down. This study shows the differences in the ability to observe certain locations within the middle ear space that represent common sites of middle pathology such as cholesteatoma. For three of the four sites, the canal wall down procedure clearly showed an increased ability to visualize these regions.

T1  - Efficacy of tympanomastoid surgery for control of infection in active chronic otitis media
AB  - The efficacy of surgery in controlling infection in 272 tympanomastoidectomy procedures for chronic otitis media (COM) was assessed by means of a four-point rating scale that incorporated both symptoms and signs, such as the presence or absence of otorrhea and granulation tissue. Of the 272 procedures, 170 were performed for COM with cholesteatoma and 102 were for active COM with granulation tissue but no cholesteatoma. Forty- seven percent were primary procedures, and 53% were revisions. Minimum follow-up was 12 months for all cases, with a mean of 30 months. Adequate control of infection occurred in 248 (91%) of the 272 cases. Of the 24 cases (9%) that developed persistent infection, 10 were controlled with a combination of oral and topical antibiotics and/or delayed skin grafting in the office. Thus overall satisfactory control of infection was achieved in 258 of 272 cases (95%). The outcome was influenced by the diagnostic category of COM: COM with cholesteatoma did significantly better than COM with granulation tissue (P = 0.02). The outcome was not influenced by the following variables: primary versus revision surgery, canal wall-up versus canal wail-down surgery, and extent of disease. The results suggest that active COM with granulation tissue may be more difficult to control than COM with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Neuroradiological evaluation of high resolution after tympanoplasty. [Italian]
AB  - The most common reason for the surgical treatment of the middle ear is the presence of inflammatory diseases including: middle ear effusion, acute otitis media, granulation tissue, tympanic membrana retraction, non cholesteatomatous ossicular erosions, postinflammatory ossicular fixation and acquired cholesteatoma. Other pathologic conditions that require surgical procedures on the middle ear are: a) otosclerosis; b) neurinomas of the VII cranial nerve, c) traumatic dislocations of the ossicular chain; d) neoplasms. Otologic surgery has benefited from rapid developments in new instrumentations and techniques such as advanced microscopic system, grafting of biocompatible material and high resolution imaging methods. High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) is helpful not only prior to all mastoid operations but also as a tool for the evaluation of the postoperative middle ear and mastoid. This is true aspecially when surgery was performed since many years ago or when the surgeon was not the one referring the CT study. Among inflammatory pathologies, cholesteatomas represent a disease which need not only an accurate preoperative evaluation but also a postsurgical follow-up, because of the difficulty to remove totally the epithelial matrix of lesion, above all if located in particular regions of the middle ear. This difficulty gives reason for the significative number of residual cholesteatomas. During the recent years, surgical techniques underwent an important evolution going from radical mastoidectomy procedures to an increased utilization of conservative techniques canal wall down tympanoplasty, canal wall up tympanoplasty (TPL). Using this procedure the middle ear is protected by a reconstructed tympanic membrane; on the other hand in canal up surgery the mastoid is no longer available to inspection as in open cavities. HRCT proved to be the elective radiological technique for the demonstration of the temporal bone anatomy and for the evaluation of alterations caused by diseases and surgical procedures. The operation leads to a loss of normal anatomy and the presence of flogistic and reparative phenomena may obscurate the interpretation of radiological images. For these reasons an accurate knowledge of clinical and otoscopic findings, of the surgical approach and of the surgical findings is always desirable.

T1  - Hearing after surgery for cholesteatoma using various techniques
AB  - The late results in 740 patients with cholesteatoma subjected to one-stage canal wall down mastoidectomy (262 patients), modified canal wall up mastoidectomy (324 patients), and tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy (154 patients) were analyzed with regard to hearing and the condition of the drum. Mean observation time was 9.3 years, range 3-21 years. Postoperative hearing (air bone gap and pure tone average) and as hearing at the last evaluation was significantly better in the canal wall up group, than in the canal wall down group, but also the preoperative hearing was better in the canal wall up group. The postoperative hearing was best in the group with tympanoplasty only without mastoidectomy. It is concluded that no single method is optimal in all cases of cholesteatoma and that cholesteatoma surgery should be individualized.

T1  - Randomized clinical trial to evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved tympanomastoidectomy
AB  - BACKGROUND: The main surgical techniques for the treatment of chronic otitis media so far, all have their characteristic advantages and disadvantages. Otolaryngologists have been trying to find an ideal surgical method for chronic otitis media. // OBJECTIVE: To study and evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved tympanomastoidectomy (PCM) for the treatment of chronic otitis media. // METHODS: Thirty-nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. Twenty patients underwent PCM and 19 underwent canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy (CWD). All patients had a follow-up period of 5 years. // RESULTS: The mean time of healing was 6 weeks in the PCM group and 8 weeks in the CWD group. The cavities in the PCM group were normal or slightly larger than the normal external auditory canal. The patients required cavity cleaning less than once per year in the PCM group and 3-4 times per year in the CWD group. One patient in the PCM group developed a recurrent cholesteatoma located in the attic. // CONCLUSION: The PCM technique showed a low-recurrence rate and good hearing outcomes. Patients had normal or slightly enlarged postoperative external auditory canal. Therefore, PCM is a useful technique for chronic otitis media.

T1  - Randomized clinical trial for partial canal wall preserved mastoitympanoplasty
AB  - Learning Objectives: Objective: To study and evaluate the outcome of partial canal wall preserved mastoitympanoplasty (PCM) for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and/or granulation tissue. Methods: Thirty-nine patients were randomly divided into two groups. 20 patients underwent PCM, 19 patients underwent canal wall down mastoitympanoplasty(CWD). All of the patients had a follow-up period of 5 years. Results: All the patients in the two groups underwent the operation successfully and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were found. The mean time of drying of cavity was 6 weeks (4-8weeks) in the PCM group, while it was 8 weeks (6-10weeks) in the CWD group. The cavity in the PCM group were near normal or slightly larger than the external auditory canal, and the tympanal flaccid part slightly wider than normal, patients could able to wear traditional hearing aids. The patients need cavity cleaning less than 1 times a year in the PCM group and 3-4 times a year in the CWD group. The surgery cavity volume was 1.4 + 0.2 ml in the PCM group and 2.6 + 1.1 ml in the CWD group (P < 0.05), the difference was statistically significant. There were 8 patients (40%) improved hearing level (threshold improved>10 dB) 5 years after operation in the PCM group and 6 patients (32%) in the CWD group, no statistically significant difference. 1 patient (5%) developed a recurrenct cholesteatoma which was located in the attic and 4 patients (20%) developed retraction pockets in the attic in the PCM group, while 3 patients (15.8%) developed cavity problem that the epithelial accumulation were not easy to clean in the CWD group, no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: With PCM technique, cholesteatoma could be completely and safely removed from the middle ear, and patients had near normal postoperative external auditory canal. Therefore, PCM was a reasonable choice for the surgery of otitis media with cholesteatoma and/or granulation tissue.

T1  - Surgery of sinus tympani cholesteatoma : Endoscopic necessity
AB  - Objective: Residual cholesteatoma occurs as a consequence of growth of a fragmental remnant of the matrix inadvertently left behind at the time of primary surgery. Poor access is the major reason for residual disease, particularly in the sinus tympani (ST). The ST is a critical anatomic region considered the most hidden recess of the middle ear. The aim of our study was to highlight the importance of extension of cholesteatoma into the ST and to demonstrate the efficacy of oto-endoscopy allowing direct access to eradicate disease from this potentially dangerous site. Materials and Methods: A total of 294 ears with acquired cholesteatoma (primary or secondary) were operated on. In this study, 212 cases were operated upon using canal wall up (CWU) technique, and 82 cases were operated upon using canal wall down (CWD) procedure. Oto-endoscopy was incorporated complementary to the microscope as a principal part of the procedure in all cases. Second-look endoscopic exploration was performed on some selected cases, depending on the operative details during the primary surgery and the postoperative findings of clinical and radiologic studies. Results: In the primary surgery after completion of microscopic cleaning, the overall incidence of intraoperative residuals detected with the endoscope was (49 cases) 16.7%. Sinus tympani was the most common site of intraoperative residuals in both CWU and CWD groups (36.7%), followed by the facial recess (28.6%), and the undersurface of the scutum in the CWU cases (20.4%); and the anterior epitympanic recess (14.3%). Reconstruction of the hearing mechanism was performed during the primary surgery in 246 cases (83.7%) and postponed to the second stage in only 48 cases (16.3%). Out of the 212 CWU cases, 93 second-look endoscopic explorations (43.9%) were performed. Eight recurrences (8.6%) were identified: 5 cases showed one or more recurrent cholesteatoma pearls, and 3 cases showed a larger open cholesteatoma recurrence extending to the aditus and mastoid. In this series, no morbidity or complication was encountered secondary to the use of endoscopes in the mastoid or middle ear. Conclusions: From our experience in endoscopic ear surgery we have come to the conclusion that the ability of endoscopes to peer into the recesses of middle ear and mastoid cavity proved without doubt its usefulness. The use of endoscope achieved significant higher degree of control over the disease and dramatically reduced the incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence particularly in those hidden recesses such as the sinus tympani.

T1  - Facial nerve dehiscence at mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: The incidence and localization of facial nerve dehiscence (FND) in patients undergoing mastoidectomy for middle ear cholesteatoma were determined. Various clinical factors predictive of FND preoperatively were also researched. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of 112 patients (115 ears) undergoing mastoidectomy by canal wall-up or canal wall-down methods during a five-year period was conducted, recording occurrence rates and sites of FND at the time of surgery. Correlations between FND and clinical features (age, sex and surgical technique) or intraoperative findings (dural exposure, labyrinthine fistula, and the absence of the stapedial suprastructure) were ascertained, based on Fisher's Exact or Chi-Square statistical analyses. Results: FND occurred in 33 (28.7%) of 115 ears. Involvement of tympanic segment only (81.8%) predominated over mastoid segment alone (9.1%) or tympanic and mastoid segments together (9.1%). Intraoperative absence of stapedial suprastructure was significantly with FND (p=0.012), while dural exposure or labyrinthine fistula at surgery and FND showed no clear associations (p>0.05). Conclusion: The incidence of FND was 28.7%, with preferential involvement of tympanic segment. Since the absence of stapedial suprastructure correlated with FND, lost integrity of the stapes may preoperatively predict FND. Therefore, otologic surgeons should be particularly cautious during mastoidectomy, given these conditions. © The Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology.

T1  - Clinical analysis of 22 cases with automastoidectomy caused by cholesteatoma
AB  - Objective: Automastoidectomy is an uncommon but unique complication of middle ear cholesteatoma that has been understudied in the current literature. The authors treated patients suffering from automastoidectomy due to cholesteatoma and reported clinical features of this complication. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study with medical records review was performed in tertiary care academic otolaryngology practice. Patients with chronic cholesteatomatous otitis media who showed evidence of automastoidectomy by temporal bone computerized tomography (TBCT) were included. Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative records were analyzed retrospectively. Results: There were 22 patients with automastoidectomy. Symptoms were otorrhea, hearing disturbance, otalgia, and facial palsy. Procedures performed were as follows: 2 patients underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy, 19 patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, and 1 patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy. The rates of facial nerve palsy and labyrinthine fistula were 9.1% and 36.4%, respectively. Postoperatively, hearing improved in 1 case and 2 cases resulted in deafness. Conclusion: Despite relatively minor symptoms, operative findings were severe in automastoidectomy. Precise preoperative evaluation and a thorough explanation to patients are necessary. Additionally, any surgical procedure involving the middle or inner ear must be performed by an experienced surgeon.

T1  - Facial canal dehiscence and tympano-mastoid surgery
AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the incidence of facial canal dehiscence in patients with chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis and tympanosclerosis who underwent canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy or canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective study in a tertiary referral hospital of operated 228 patients between April 2008 and June 2013. Using intraoperative findings, data were collected regarding the patients' age upon presentation, gender, clinical diagnosis, presence of cholesteatoma, preopeartive and postoperative facial nerve function, presence or absence of facial canal dehiscence and its location, lateral semicircular canal fistula or dural exposure due to erosion of bony plate. Results: The frequency of facial canal dehiscence in our patients was 28.1%. The most common site of dehiscence (68/228, 82.8%) was the tympanic segment (P<0.001) and the incidence of facial canal dehiscence in ears with cholesteatoma (92.2%) was distinctly higher than than other ears (P < 0.001). When the pediatric group (=16 years of age) and the adult group (>16 years of age) were compared, 10.5% of the 38 pediatric age patients had facial canal dehiscence, while 31.6% of the 190 adult patients (P<0.05). The most common accompanying findings were respectively dural exposure (12.7%) and lateral semicircular canal fistula (11%). There was a statistically significant correlation between semisircular canal fistula and dehiscence (P<0.001) and in the ears with dural exposure and dehiscence (P<0.01). The dehiscence was was seen significantly more often in patients who had the canal wall-down tympanomastoidectomy than in those who had the canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (P<0.001). The incidence of dehiscence was more often in female patients and in primary surgery group but both results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Dehiscence of facial canal was mostly seen in patients with cholesteatoma and mostly located in the tympanic segment. Also, most common site for the facial nerve injury during otologic surgery is the tympanic segment and mechanical dissection is most often indicated in this region. The presence of semicircular canal fistula and dural exposure on preoperative computerized tomography of temporal region are invaluable clue for presence of dehiscence.

T1  - Epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration technique in middle ear surgery: 12-Year result
AB  - Objective; The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration (EMO). Canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy can secure a good surgical field, allowing lesions to be eliminated. However, cavity problems inevitably occur. Canal wall up (CWU) mastoidectomy can avoid cavity problems, but complete removal of lesions is more difficult, and retraction pockets can form. The goal of EMO is to obtain optimal surgical results as in CWD surgery while avoiding cavity problems. Here we introduce the surgical techniques of EMO and discuss the results. I Materials & Methods; A retrospective case review of 401 ears in 398 patients was performed. The EMO technique consists of a simple mastoidectomy, atticotomy, epitympanectomy and epitympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration. The results of 12 years of surgery performed between December 1994 and June 2007 were analyzed and the outcomes of the procedures were evaluated. Results; Postoperative results from 401 ears were evaluated. The mean age was 42 years, and the mean follow up period was 30 months. There was a 6.2 ( 7.8 dB hearing gain (p<0.05), and the tympanic cavity cholesteatoma recurrence rate was 4.2%. In 0.9 % of cases, there was a residual mastoid cholesteatoma, and these cases underwent revision CWD surgery. There was no attic retraction or retraction pocket formation. Conclusion; Using EMO techniques, we can eliminate the disadvantages of CWD and CWU mastoidectomy. Cavity problems can be avoided and retraction pocket formation can be prevented. EMO is a useful technique and can be considered before CWD surgery. Copyright 2005 © The Mediterranean Society of Otology and Audiology.

T1  - Tips for and usefulness of the canal wall-up technique for surgical removal of cholesteatoma
AB  - This report provides detailed guidelines for the surgical removal of a cholesteatoma using the canal wall-up (CWU) method. Five techniques for the CWU method are available to reduce the risk of complications and development of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. (1) The operation method must be decided prior to the operation by reference to computed-tomographic images. (2) The cholesteatoma membrane must be pushed out from the back and removed en bloc. (3) Two communication routes between the tympanic cavity and mastoid antrum (an anterior and a posterior route) must be created to provide a wide surgical field. (4) A transcanal endoscope must be used to approach the cholesteatoma around the field of the tympanic sinus. (5) A 1/2 to 1/3 filleted cartilage must be used for scutumplasty or tympanoplasty. During cholesteatoma surgery, the canal wall-down (CWD) method or the canal wall reconstruction (CWR) method are sometimes used to reconstruct the external auditory meatus using soft tissue or temporal muscle tissue. These methods are appropriate if growth of the mastoid cavity is apparent or if indicated by the physical condition of the patient. However, the choice between the CWU and CWR method in terms of safety is a matter left to the judgment of the physician. If the external auditory meatus is destroyed, the CWD method must be chosen for re-operation after cholesteatoma recurrence. This greatly improves the postoperative quality-of-life (QOL) of the patients. Preservation of the external auditory meatus is extremely important, and it is imperative that every physician seeks to preserve it.

T1  - The role of imaging methods in diagnostic and therapeutic management of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - At the present time a closed operational technique (canal wall up - CWU) or an open technique (canal wall down - CWD with canal wall reconstruction or mastoid cavity obliteration in the treatement of middle ear cholesteatoma is preferred. Due to relatively high risk of residual and/or reccurent disease, a control, second-look operation is indicated. Majority of patients are yet free of the disease, and thus exposed to unnecessary operational risks. Therefore, less invasive imaging methods for the detection of recidivous cholesteatoma are investigated. Lately, magnetic resonance (MR) with high predictive value has overcome previously used high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). This paper presents a brief review of imaging methods possibilities in the diagnosis of primary cholesteatoma, as well as its postoperative recidivism. The abilities of HRCT and especially importance of new MR methods, like delayed postcontrast imaging (DPI), convetional echo- planar diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and non-echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging (non-EPI DWI) are discussed. Non-EPI DWI technique has the main contribution in assesement of postoperative changes and potentional cholesteatoma recidivism, thereby is preferred nowadays.

T1  - External ear canal reconstruction in patients with radical mastoidectomy
AB  - Chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma is still an important subject. Canal wall up (closed), canal wall down (open) and the obliterative cavity techniques are the offered procedures for the surgery of the chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Despite the advantages of preserving the normal anatomy and hearing ability, the risk of recurrence of cholesteatoma and revision mastoidectomy is high in the canal wall down procedures. In the open techniques, cavity care and the hearing impaiment are the problems, but the risk of the of the recurrence of cholesteatoma is lower. In recent years, reconstruction of the hearing is as important as the cholesteatoma n choronic otitis media surgery. However, for the recontruction of the hearing and to save the trouble of cavity care, one must create a cavity which is small, dry and restored as much as possible. In this study our goal was to get a cavity which is dry, smal and together with epithelized EAC in our cases For this purpose in GATA Haydarpaşa training hospital between 1997 and 2000. We performed radical mastoidectomy + external auditory canal reconstruction(EAC) + mastoid cavity obliteration operation to 12 kronik otitis media patients with cholesteatoma..We followed up these patients postoperatily* for 12-36 mouth (ort 19.9)*. In all of our cases; at the end of first month in 3 cases,at the end of third month in 5 cases, at the end of sixth month in 9 cases and at the end of one year in 11 cases we got dry and epithelized EAC. In one case because dirty smelling ear discharge which is not responding to treatment we performed revision mastoidectomy and defected recurrent cholesteatoma filling middle ear in fourteenth month. At the same time bone graft which we used for EAC was resorbed. We concluded that, during eadical mastoidectomy operations, reconstruction of the EAC via using cortical bone grafting and obliteration of the mastoid cavity via using the temporal muscle is effective against the cavity problem and helps inmaintaining hearing reconstruction compared to the open techniques. © Gülhane Askeri Tip Akademisi 2015.

T1  - Paediatric cholesteatoma: Experience of universiti kebangsaan malaysia medical centre
AB  - Introduction: Cholesteatoma is an aggressive disease and its management poses a greater challenge in children than in adults. This study reviews the experience of Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre in the clinical presentation and management outcome of acquired cholesteatoma in paediatrics that required surgical interventions. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of case records of patients below 18 years old who underwent surgery from 1999 to 2010. Results: A total of 46 patients presented with 53 cases of cholesteatoma in which seven patients had bilateral disease. The age of presentation ranged from four to 18 years old with a mean age of 12 years. Male and female patients were 65% and 35% respectively. Otorrhoea or previous history of otorrhoea on presentation was found in 94% and 96% of them had hearing impairment. Cerebellopontine angle abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombosis and mastoiditis were among the complications. Tympanic membrane was retracted in 64% while 47% having had attic retraction and 53% had total atelectasis. A majority (85%) underwent canal wall down surgery with or without tympanoplasty. Post-operatively, 71% had improvement or preserved hearing level. The duration of follow up ranged from one month to 13 years and a quarter had recurrent disease and underwent revision surgeries. Conclusion: Majority of the cholesteatoma patients suffered from hearing loss and otorrhoea. Tympanic membrane retraction remained the most common clinical finding. Hence, children with persistent otorrhoea after adequate treatment may represent cholesteatoma. Surgical options of canal wall up and canal wall down procedures have equal risk of recurrence.

T1  - Late results of cholesteatoma surgery in children
AB  - Introduction: Cholesteatoma in children is considered more aggressive than in adults. The aim of an otosurgeon is to remove cholesteatoma safely and completely and at the same time to preserve anatomy and physiology of the ear. Material and methods: We are evaluating a group of 38 cholesteatomas in the children who were operated at ORLCHHK in Ružomberok in 1996-2006. The patients have been monitored to show in what extent the eradication of cholesteatoma, audiological results as well as tympanoplasty have been successful. Results: By canal wall up (CWU) technique, 29 ears were operated on and canal wall down (CWD) technique was used in 3 ears. 6 ears did not require antrotomy and/or antromastoidectomy and they were resolved by cleaning tympanic sinus and/ or atticus. We detected recurrent cholesteatoma in 17 ears (45 %). We re-operated in 4 cases because of unsatisfactory result of tympanoplasty. 42 % ears were without failure of hearing postoperatively, and decrease aier-bone gap (ABG) to 20 dB was recorded in 21 % ears. We evaluated ABG 25-40 dB in 37 % ears. There have been no records of ABG more than 40 dB postoperatively. Conclusion: Nowadays, surgery of cholesteatoma is not only about safety and radical removal of pathological tissue. Functional, minimal invasive surgery is optimal, which enables preservation of most of the original structures and thus it offers the best conditions for reconstruction.

T1  - Postoperative results of middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma was evaluated from the point of postoperative hearing and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Of the 36 ears operated on in the previous 5 years and 5 months, intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in 27 ears, and tympanoplasty with posterior canal wall removal in 9 ears. The patients were evaluated for a follow-up period of more than 6 months after tympanoplasty. The rate of success in hearing improvement was 82.4% according to the criteria of the Japan Otological Society. Recurrence of the cholesteatoma was found in 2 ears (5.6%), which had been treated by intact canal wall tympanoplasty. A retraction pocket in the attic was found in 5 ears (17.9%), following intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Reconstruction of the attic defect with cartilage and obliteration of the mastoid cavity were useful in the prevention of postoperative retraction pocket.

T1  - Middle ear diseases from the viewpoint of gas exchange function in the mastoid
AB  - The physiology and pathophysiology of middle ear ventilation in ears with various diseases was evaluated from the perspective of gas exchange through the mucosa of mastoid air cells as well as from the perspective of eustachian tube function. 1. In 50% of patients with otitis media with effusion (OME), gas exchange function was impaired. The size of the mastoid and the presence or absence of aeration in the middle ear were closely correlated with gas exchange function. After myringotomy and removal of the effusion, gas exchange function recovered in most of the ears with impaired function. These results indicate that impairment of the gas exchange function in OME appears to be reversible, and that the surgical treatment of OME can be interpreted as being directed toward the recovery of gas exchange function. 2. In refractory OME which has not been cured before the age of 10, both eustachian tube and gas exchange functions are highly impaired. 3. Middle ear surgery involving mastoidectomy results in total abolishment of gas exchange function in the mastoid and a failure of recovery of aeration. These observations suggest that the canal-wall-down procedure is recommended, rather than the canal-wall-up procedure, after mastoidectomy to avoid the risk of unexpected sequelae, such as recurrent cholesteatoma. Mastoid obliteration is also justified after mastoidectomy in the sense that such functional dead space should be abandoned. 4. In the future of middle ear surgery, therefore, surgeons should consider minimally invasive surgery in combination with the conservative preoperative treatment which is now prevalent in nasal surgery. 5. Organic and irreversible impairment of both eustachian tube function and gas exchange function seems to be related to the pathogenesis of cholesteatoma as an ultimate outcome of these impairments in refractory OME. 6. Finally, a new concept of middle ear ventilation was proposed ; ventilation of the middle ear may be managed primarily by gas exchange function and the eustachian tube may play a key role in clearance of the middle ear rather than in ventilation.

T1  - One-Stage Tympanoplasty and Mastoid Obliteration for Cholesteatoma Otitis Media
AB  - One-stage tympanoplasty and mastoid obliteration for cholesteatoma otitis media was performed in 37 ears from November, 1988 through December, 1991. Twenty three received modified type III tympanoplasty for 17 attic type and 6 pars tensa type cholesteatomas, and 14 had modified type ¥ tympanoplasty for 4 attic type and 10 pars tensa type cholesteatomas. A part of the posterior ear canal wall was removed for direct visualization of the cholesteatoma. After complete removal of the cholesteatoma, the mastoid cavity was obliterated with bone chips and cartilage, with bone chips, Palva's flap and cartilage, or with Palva's flap and cartilage. Postoperative hearing was good in 20/23 ears (87.0%) after modified type HI tympanoplasty, and in 6/14 ears (42.9%) after modified type ¥ tympanoplasty. Good results were obtained in 18/21 (85.7%) of those with attic type cholesteatomas and in 8/16 (50.0%) of those with pars tensa cholesteatomas. Cholesteatomas recurred in 0/23 ears (0%) after modified type III tympanoplasty and in 2/14 ears (14.3%, pars tensa type) after modified type ¥ tympanoplasty. These findings suggest that one-stage tympanoplasty and mastoid obliteration is useful, especially for attic type cholesteatomas. © 1994, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Surgical Treatment of Chronic Otitis Media in Children
AB  - The longterm results of tympanoplasty were analyzed in 53 ears of children aged 4 to 15 years with chronic otitis media. A canal-up type I tympanoplasty was employed to 34 ears with non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis (25 granulating otitis and 9 adhesive otitis). The rate of primary graft take (success rate of closing perforation) was 91% and the hearing results were satisfactory. The overall success rates were similar among all age groups. Consequently, tympanoplasty can be recommended in children of all ages, including preschool age. Regarding initial surgery in 15 ears with cholesteatoma, an extensive cholesteatoma filling the entire air-cell area was found in 5 ears (33%) and cholesteatoma spreading into the middle ear cleft was found in 11 ears (73%). Despite a large number of cases with active and rapidly growing cholesteatoma, complications from cholesteatoma in children were relatively low. In our series, only one case developed a complication due to wide exposure of the facial nerve. Thirteen cases with cholesteatoma extending into the attic or mastoid were treated by canal wall down procedures with canal reconstruction or mastoid obliteration. Six cases with cholesteatoma restricted to the middle ear space were treated with canal wall up procedures. At the latest follow-up ranging 4 to 52 months (average 24.5 months) after surgery, all cases were dry and maintained good anatomic results without recurrence. From these results, surgical procedures for cholesteatoma in children should be selected according to the extent of the lesion as in adults. © 1993, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Cholesteatoma; A Clinical Study of 104 Patients
AB  - The clinical features and postoperative course of 104 cases of cholesteatoma were analyzed statistically. Cholesteatoma was categorized as PF (pars flaccida), PSQ (posterosuperior quadrant) or central type. One stage surgery was performed on 44 ears (57.7%) of the PF type and on 16 ears of the PSQ type (61.5%). Canal wall-up operation was performed on 37 ears of the PF (48.7%) and 15 ears of the PSQ type (57.7%). Only 16 ears underwent canal down operations. Columella III type tympanoplasty was most frequently (37.5%) performed for ossicular chain reconstruction. The overall rate of improvement of hearing was 63.2%. Postoperatively 44.7% of the patients showed abnormal appearance of the ear drum, such as retraction pocket, adhesions or otorrhea. Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in 17 ears of the PF type and in 2 ears of the PSQ type. Cholesteatomas extending from the aditus through the mastoid cavity showed a high rate of recurrence. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 21.4% of all ears. In general, ears without otorrhea had better postoperative hearing than wet ears. The incidence of recurrence was especially high in wet ears of the PF type. © 1991, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Results of surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - Operative findings and results in cases of middle ear cholesteatoma were analyzed with special reference to postoperative hearing and recurrence of cholesteatoma. Of the 242 ears operated on in the past 9 years and 9 months, intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in 114 ears, tympanoplasty with the posterior canal wall removal in 81 ears, and radical mastoidectomy in 47 ears. Of the 139 ears observed for more than 6 months after tympanoplasty, postoperative hearing was improved in 34 ears (24.5%), decreased in 15 ears (9.3%) and still in the range of the preoperative level in 90 ears (66.2%). Recurrence of the cholesteatoma was found in 15 ears (6.2%), five of which had been treated by radical mastoidectomy. Though there were no such recurrences in 46 patients treated by staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty, a retraction pocket which was considered to be a precursor of cholesteatoma was found in seven cases (15.2%). In order to avoid a retraction pocket in intact canal wall tympanoplasty, closure of the attic accompanied by obliteration of the mastoid cavity is advised. © 1987, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Results of conservative surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma
AB  - A retrospective study was carried out to analyze treatment results for cholesteatoma at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. All patients undergoing primary surgical treatment from January 1, 1969 to December 31, 1973 were followed through October 1976. Treatment failures were based on the occurrence of postoperative cholesteatoma. The probability of being disease free for periods up to five years after original surgery was then estimated for each type of operation. Postoperative cholesteatoma occurred after atticotomy in 17%, intact canal wall mastoidectomy in 35%, and modified radical mastoidectomy in 9%. The postoperative cholesteatoma rate in the group having intact canal wall mastoidectomy was more than twice as high for those patients under age nine. The likelihood of being disease free five years after intact canal wall surgery was estimated to be 36% using the life table method. Disease recurrence was significantly higher after intact canal wall surgery compared to other surgical methods. The effectiveness of this method should be evaluated in a randomized, prospective manner to minimize patient selection and treatment bias.

T1  - Role of Langerhans cells, Ki-67 protein and apoptosis in acquired cholesteatoma: prospective clinical study
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of Langerhans cells in the pathogenesis and clinical picture of middle-ear cholesteatoma.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 40 patients operated upon for a diagnosis of chronic otitis due to acquired cholesteatoma.RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: A closed surgical technique was used in 20 per cent of patients and an open technique in 80 per cent. Langerhans cells were more densely accumulated in cholesteatoma epithelium, compared with external ear canal skin (p < 0.001). Staining for Ki-67 protein was greater in cholesteatoma epithelium (p < 0.001) and Apo2.7 protein staining (indicating apoptosis) was more prominent (p < 0.001), compared with ear canal skin. Regarding significant relationships between clinical and pathological findings, staining for Ki-67 (p = 0.046) and Apo2.7 (p = 0.037) was more prominent in patients undergoing open versus closed surgery.CONCLUSION: Using cell proliferation and apoptosis markers, a dense Langerhans cell infiltration was found to occur as a host response to middle-ear cholesteatoma.

T1  - A ten year statistical follow-up of 1142 consecutive cases of cholesteatoma: the closed vs. the open technique
AB  - Cholesteatoma has long been a formidable adversary to the otologic surgeon. The surgical treatment has been basically by two methods, open and closed. It was felt that a study should be undertaken to compare the results obtained over a long period of time, utilizing these two methods. A need for this study existed as the same number of new cases of cholesteatoma was presenting each year. In reviewing the literature, it is found that new advancements have not yet been made in the prevention of the disease and the medical and surgical management has remained essentially the same. The ideal goal of successful surgery, namely an ear without disease, with normal hearing, and an intact drum and posterior canal wall, has been difficult to achieve in a high percentage of cases. To achieve this goal, two main surgical methods have evolved: the classical "open method," and the more recent "closed method. " In the open method cases, the hearing results were often poor and the cavity presented a management problem. In the closed method there has been a fairly high occurrence of residual, and/or recurrent cholesteatoma which mecessitated a second procedure. These two methods were compared by reviewing a large number of histologically proved cholesteatoma cases 10 years after surgery, to determine the incidence of recurrence of cholesteatoma and the residual hearing function. The results of this study show conclusively that the hearing was better using the closed method, but the recurrence rate was considerably higher. This paper presents a practical method of approach to the management of all presenting cases of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Evolving considerations in the surgical management of cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a contemporary, pragmatic approach to managing cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.SETTING: Single tertiary referral center.PATIENTS: All patients that underwent cholesteatoma surgery, having profound hearing loss in the contralateral ear.INTERVENTION(S): Cholesteatoma surgery.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Surgical strategy, preoperative and postoperative audiometric outcomes, short- and long-term complications, recidivism.RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients met criteria, representing 0.25% of all chronic ear surgeries performed between 1970 and 2012. Patients undergoing surgery in the latter half of the study underwent intact canal wall procedures and ossicular chain reconstruction more frequently despite having similar severities of disease. All patients with inner ear fistula underwent an open-cavity operation. In the early postoperative period, 86% of ears had stable or improved hearing levels, and all patients maintained preoperative bone conduction thresholds. At a mean follow-up of 48 months, 79% of patients maintained stable or improved pure tone thresholds, whereas 2 subjects experienced delayed sensorineural hearing loss and 2 experienced isolated declining speech discrimination. Notably, 3 of the latter 4 patients were diagnosed with labyrinthine fistula and had undergone radical mastoidectomy. None of the patients who received an intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy experienced worsening bone conduction thresholds, whereas 1 subject demonstrated a delayed decline in speech discrimination and another recurred.CONCLUSION: It is commonly held that the radical or classic modified radical mastoidectomy is the procedure of choice when managing cholesteatoma in the only hearing ear while intact canal wall techniques are contraindicated. Over the last 20 years, we have adopted a less-rigid, functional approach favoring intact canal wall procedures in the absence of inner ear fistula rather than unequivocally committing to an open cavity. This strategy has been influenced by advancements in preoperative evaluation, increasing familiarity and refinement of closed-cavity techniques, postoperative imaging surveillance options, and the potential for cochlear implant "salvage" in the rare case of profound hearing loss. Based on the current series, this approach appears safe when performed by an experienced surgeon, and reliable long-term patient follow-up is maintained.

T1  - Closed versus obliteration technique in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - In 533 surgical procedures for cholesteatoma, a closed technique was used in 60%, an obliteration technique with Palva flap was used in 35%, and an open technique was used in 5%. The closed technique has been done in stages in the authors' institution since 1973. The obliteration technique was only staged if the mesotympanum was dissected. In some cases, the Palva flap was partially lifted from the bone to check posterior cavities. A closed technique in one stage provided intact tympanic membrane in 97% of cases, but retraction pocket occurred in 25%; ABG was within 20 dB in 68% of ears if the stapes was intact and in 40% if crura were missing. Obliteration technique in one stage (if the mesotympanum was normal) provided intact tympanic membrane in 100% of cases, but one late residual cholesteatoma under the flap eroded the semicircular canal after 5 years. ABG within 20 dB was achieved in 68% of the ears if the stapes was intact and in 40% if crura were missing. Closed technique in two stages with Silastic sheeting achieved intact tympanic membrane in 97% of the ears. Residual cholesteatoma was removed at the second stage in 24% of the ears. ABG within 20 dB was achieved in 57% of the ears if stapes was intact and in 52% if crura were missing. Ten percent of the ears underwent an obliteration transformation at the second stage because of large mesotympanum cholesteatoma or retraction pocket. Late retraction pockets were observed in 10% of cases. Obliteration technique in two stages provided an intact tympanic membrane in 96.8% of the ears.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

T1  - Importance of en bloc homograft in intact canal wall tympanoplasty
AB  - The incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence using intact canal tympanoplasty has been compared in 2 series of operations. The first group represents cases treated with the conventional conservative technique for attic and middle ear surgery. The second group represents cases on which the concept of 'radical attic and middle ear surgery' has been applied and an en bloc homograft has been used for reconstruction. A preliminary survey has shown a much lower incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence in ears belonging to the second group. The advantages of this surgical technique are discussed.

T1  - "Three cartilages" technique in intact canal wall tympanoplasty to prevent recurrent cholesteatoma
AB  - Residual cholesteatoma is the consequence of leaving squamous epithelium in the mastoid and middle ear cleft. It has been demonstrated that the only effective way to reduce the risk of epidermoid cyst neoformation is meticulous and radical removal of cholesteatoma matrix and staging of the operation, regardless of whether a closed or open mastoid cavity tympanoplasty technique has been performed. Recurrent cholesteatoma usually occurs after intact canal wall tympanoplasty secondary to middle ear, attic, and mastoid retraction of the graft, especially in cases with destruction of the scutum or absence of malleus and incus; this is still considered a major problem with this surgical technique. During the last five years we have been performing a procedure we have developed to avoid this retraction. Concave autogenous cartilage from the upper part of the concha auriculae trimmed in three pieces to protect attic, mastoid, and middle ear for graft retraction has been successfully used in 106 surgical procedures. This study describes the surgical technique and analyzes the anatomic and hearing results.

T1  - Mastoid surgery in childhood
AB  - The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed. In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%. Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%. Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy. An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease.

T1  - Clinical and surgical aspects of cholesteatomas in children
AB  - A review of 101 charts of pediatric patients who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma in the Hospital das Clinicas, Sao Paulo, Brazil, showed that the peak incidence was in the 10- to 15-year-old age group (mean age, 10.7 years). A high incidence of complications (45.5%) and a significant functional impairment (air-bone gap greater than 40 dB in 49% of patients) were some of the particular features of our patients. Radical or modified radical mastoidectomies were performed in 75 cases (74.3% of cases). The open technique was chosen primarily to eradicate cholesteomatous disease, but the satisfactory functional results also achieved support our preference for this technique.

T1  - Efficacy of surgical treatment of chronic otitis media
AB  - This article presents our results of surgical treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) and discusses its efficacy regarding the control of disease and hearing results. A retrospective chart review of 84 ears was performed. Forty-one ears with noncholesteatomatous COM underwent tympanomastoidectomy, 43 ears with cholesteatoma were managed according to the extension of the disease, closed mastoidectomy was indicated in 19 cases, and open mastoidectomy was performed in 24 ears. In the group without cholesteatoma, a stable ear with closed tympanic membrane was obtained in 85% of cases after the first procedure. The speech response threshold before and after surgery was 38 and 26 dB. In patients with cholesteatoma, a dry ear was achieved in 79% of cases on both techniques after the first intervention. The recurrence rate of cholesteatoma was 10% for the closed technique and 4% for the open technique. The mean preoperative and postoperative SRTs for the closed technique were 30 and 29 dB and for the open technique were 50 and 54 dB. The surgical treatment for COM can be a rewarding procedure if a correct technique is indicated. The surgery should be tailored regarding the clinical stage and intraoperative findings in each case.

T1  - Techniques of the Tympanomastoidectomy with Reconstruction of the Posterior Bone Wall of the External Auditory Canal
AB  - A combined tympanoplasty method, the mobile-bridge tympanoplasty, has been applied at the Clinic for Ear, Nose and Throat Diseases in Novi Sad since 1998. Mobile-bridge tympanoplasty is performed at our Clinic by applying Feldmann's procedure utilizing a microsurgical oscillating saw. It is a combination of closed and open techniques for surgical treatment of middle ear diseases. In addition to this technique, a method for reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of the external auditory canal was introduced. This procedure is applied in cases of damage or impairment of the bony ear canal wall using mastoid cortical temporal bone graft or modeled cartilage of the concha. Maintenance of general anatomical relations in the middle ear enables good ventilation of pneumatic spaces of the middle ear and Eustachian tube permeability, thus providing good conditions for ossicular chain reconstruction. The incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in combined mobile-bridge tympanoplasty and tympanoplasty with reconstruction of the posterior bone wall was 6% in total. The incidence values for the recurrent cholesteatoma in closed tympanoplasty and in cases of open techniques were 10%. Mobile-bridge tympanoplasty and reconstruction of the posterior bone wall of external auditory canal are methods of choice in surgical treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma that progressed to the attic space, sinus tympani and facial recess.

T1  - Preference for the closed technique in the management of cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children: a retrospective study of 215 consecutive patients treated over 10 years
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate clinical data, extensions, residual and recurrent lesion rates, and functional results in cases of cholesteatoma in pediatric patients.DESIGN: A retrospective study at a single tertiary care center over a decade.PATIENTS: In 199 children (mean age 9.6 years), 215 cholesteatomas were treated surgically, and the children were followed up for an average of 70 months (range 25-118 months).INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic and rehabilitative surgical procedures were done, using either a closed technique (CT) or an open technique: tympanoplasty in open technique (TOT), radical mastoidectomy (RM), or Rambo's technique)MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical findings, residual and recurrent lesions rate, and hearing assessment.RESULTS: The first surgical procedure was CT in 88% of cases, TOT in 10%, RM and Rambo's technique in 1%. Two operations were done in 61.8% of children; 21% had three operations and 4.5% had four. Residual lesions were observed in 21.5% of all children, 32.8% in those undergoing a planned second look. Recurrence rate was 9.8%. Surprisingly, residual and recurrent lesion rates were higher after TOT (23.8% and 19%) than after CT (20.5%, 8.9%), but TOT-treated children had much more extensive lesions. A speech reception threshold (SRT) <30 dB hearing loss (HL) was achieved in 63.7% of patients, and normal hearing was obtained in 12.1%; SRT was significantly better after CT (mean 26.7 dB) than after TOT (mean 37.4 dB), after type II (mean 27 dB) than after type III (35 dB). A high-frequency pure-tone hearing loss >10 dB was uncommon (7.6%).CONCLUSION: These results support the continued use of CT in most cases of cholesteatoma in children in developed countries.

T1  - Longterm results in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - From the results of 689 cases of cholesteatoma operated and followed over a period of 9 years, are discussed the respective indications of opened and closed techniques. The intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy is the preferred technique. It is undertaken on the understanding that it will be done in 2 stages over a 1-year interval. From the revised 460 cases, the presence of residual cholesteatoma was found in one out of 2 cases. Cause of high incidence are analyzed and commented. Retraction pockets or true recurrence of cholesteatoma whose incidence was 11% at the beginning of the series have practically disappeared since it was started to repair the tympanic frame with cartilage. Open techniques, modified radical mastoidectomy, with or without obliteration, are done when a 2-stage procedure is not possible. They are also indicated in particular cases related to the nature of the disease, mastoid pneumatization, condition of the attic wall or the patient's age. Auditory results do not show any significant difference between the open and closed techniques when the ossicular chain is complete or the stapes intact. However, in cases of subtotal ossicular defects, preservation of the tympanic frame provided the most favourable conditions for a functional restoration.

T1  - Long-term results of various surgical treatments for cholesteatoma
AB  - The authors have studied 11 series of results following cholesteatoma surgery by closed or open technique. The closed technique was performed in 77%. The notion of surgical revision is not accepted by all surgeons; it is practised with an average of 59% for the whole series. Residual cholesteatoma and/or recurrences are observed in 34% of the cases of which 20% have been discovered at the time of revision surgery. Surgical revision appears mandatory to the authors.

T1  - High incidence of complications encountered in chronic otitis media surgery in a U.S. metropolitan public hospital
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the incidence and nature of complicating factors in surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) in a metropolitan public hospital in the United States.METHODS: A retrospective review was performed over 2 years in a metropolitan public hospital to identify cases of surgery for chronic ear disease with the following complicating factors: intracranial or extracranial abscess, labyrinthine fistula, dural dehiscence with or without associated encephalocele or meningocele, or extensive involvement of the facial nerve by cholesteatoma with or without paralysis.RESULTS: Thirty-three of 90 consecutive operations for COM (37%) met criteria for complicated chronic otitis media (CCOM). The majority (85%) of patients had cholesteatoma involvement. Most patients (73%) were managed by an extended modified radical mastoidectomy. An additional 31 procedures were required in these 33 patients for control of complications. There was no iatrogenic sensorineural hearing loss or facial paralysis.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CCOM in this large, U.S. metropolitan public hospital is similar to that observed in developing nations. CCOM significantly complicates chronic ear surgery and substantially increases the use of resources. Maintaining functional hearing is possible, but difficult, and should be considered secondary to prevention of further complications and eradication of disease. Access to health care and proper follow-up are crucial in prevention of CCOM.

T1  - Residue of middle ear cholesteatoma after intact canal wall tympanoplasty: surgical findings at one year
AB  - The rate of residual disease after surgery for acquired middle ear cholesteatoma was investigated in 167 ears of 164 patients who had undergone planned second-look tympanoplasty by the intact canal wall technique. Overall, operative findings at the second stage revealed 65 cases of residual disease in 48 ears (29%). These consisted of 50 squamous pearls, 11 cases of the flat, open type, and 4 cases of the extensive type. The configuration of residual disease is closely related to the technical difficulty of eradication, since en bloc removal is much easier in the squamous pearl than in the open or extensive type, mainly because of the unclear margin with the surrounding tissues. The proportion of cases of the open type was greater in children than in adults, in pars tensa cholesteatoma than in pars flaccida cholesteatoma, and in severe primary middle ear disease than in moderate or mild disease, although these differences were not statistically significant. The extensive type occurred in 4 ears with severe primary disease, 3 of which were in children. These results support the value and importance of the staged procedure for middle ear cholesteatoma, particularly when operated on by the intact canal wall technique.

T1  - Mastoidectomy audit: results of the Royal College of surgeons of England comparative audit of ENT surgery
AB  - This paper presents the results of a national comparative audit of mastoid surgery, retrospectively analysing 611 operations by 55 consultants. Confidentiality for both patient and surgeon was assured. For cholesteatoma 80% of mastoidectomies performed were open cavity procedures and for other middle ear disease 58% used an intact canal wall technique. Thirty-two surgeons used only an open cavity mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma during the period of the audit. There was a statistically significantly greater number of wet ears with open cavities than with closed cavities, but the frequency of the operator did not correlate with the dry ear rate. Ten serious complications (facial palsy and dead ear) were recorded. All occurred in open cavity mastoidectomies. The post-operative hearing status was unknown in 40% of patients.

T1  - Cholesteatoma with intact tympanic membrane: a report of 41 cases
AB  - Aural cholesteatoma may present itself as an unexplained hearing impairment without either perforation or otorrhea and without radiologic evidence of bone destruction. The etiology is probably congenital. In our cholesteatoma cases, 3.7% occur in individuals with an intact tympanic membrane. Most of these patients have had the disease 5 years or less and 50% are under 20 years of age. Complications of the disease are uncommon in this group. All but 1 of our 41 cases were managed with the intact canal wall technique. Most were reexplored (planned second-stage) and residual disease was encountered in 32%. One should keep the possibility of a congentital cholesteatoma in mind wheneger encountering a unilateral serous otitis media or an unexplained unilateral conductive hearing impairment, regardless of the patient's age.

T1  - Treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - We studied retrospectively 28 cases of cholesteatoma in children whose ages were 3 to 13 years old. All had undergone surgery between 1989 and 1995. The intact canal wall technique was the predominant method used in the initial operation, with long term goals of an anatomically normal and infection-free ear. Cholesteatoma was found postoperatively in 15 cases and was considered to be residual in 6 cases and recurrent in 9. The residual cholesteatoma was relatively uncommon and usually removable in an exploratory second operation. Our findings showed that the intact canal wall technique was the best initial operation if two-stage surgery was planned. Avoidance of a retraction pocket, which tends to progress to a recurrent cholesteatoma, is important to successful treatment.

T1  - Residual Cholesteatoma After Endoscope-guided Surgery in Children
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopes can facilitate surgery within tympanomastoid recesses that are not visible with the operating microscope. This study investigates whether use of endoscopes to guide dissection of cholesteatoma leads to lower rates of residual cholesteatoma than using the endoscope only for inspection after microscope-guided dissection.STUDY DESIGN: Comparative cohort study.SETTING: Tertiary pediatric center.PATIENTS: Two hundred thirty-five patients with acquired or congenital cholesteatoma in children <18 years having intact canal wall surgery and follow-up >12 months.INTERVENTIONS: Comparison of group (A) microscope surgery followed by endoscopic inspection, with group (B) endoscope-guided dissection.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Residual cholesteatoma rates, controlling for site of initial cholesteatoma, detection by second-stage surgery, and length of follow-up.RESULTS: Analysis of all patients showed endoscopic dissection was associated with less residua in the middle ear (risk difference = 0.12; p = 0.026, Kaplan-Meier log rank analysis; number needed to treat = 9) but not at other sites. When restricting analysis to ears that were evaluated with second look surgery, no significant reduction in residual disease was found after endoscopic dissection at any site (e.g., retrotympanic residua: 12% Group A versus 7% Group B (NS, Fisher exact test). Endoscopic dissection allowed more permeatal surgery. No complications were attributable to endoscope use. Wound complications occurred in 4% of open cases.CONCLUSION: Endoscopes enhance surgical access to tympanomastoid recesses. In conjunction with the availability of the operating microscope, angled instruments, and KTP laser, endoscope-guided dissection provides a small incremental benefit for prevention of residual cholesteatoma, and facilitates a minimally invasive approach.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula as a complication of cholesteatoma
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to present the authors' experience in the management of labyrinthine fistula caused by cholesteatoma.METHODS: The clinical charts of 92 patients who underwent surgical procedures for cholesteatoma complicated by labyrinthine fistula between 1979 and 1975 were reviewed retrospectively. In this period, 1,205 patients were operated on for cholesteatoma. In each patient, the site and size of the fistula were evaluated during surgery and the hearing thresholds were compared before and after surgery.RESULTS: The fistula involved the lateral semicircular canal in 71 patients. Multiple fistulas were observed in nine patients. Postoperative hearing levels were unchanged or improved in 83.7% of patients. Comparison between hearing outcomes and size of the fistula showed better findings when smaller size fistulas were found. No significant differences between open and closed techniques were detected. Favorable outcomes were obtained in patients treated with surgical obliteration of the interrupted labyrinth.CONCLUSIONS: The current study confirmed that careful manipulation of the labyrinthine fistula is mandatory to preserve hearing functions for these patients. According to the authors' experience, the future trend for fistula treatment could be directed toward less conservative techniques compared with the previous indications favoring methods of interruption and subsequent obliteration of the semicircular canals.

T1  - Management of childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - We report a retrospective study of 54 children with 57 involved ears who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma before their sixteenth birthdays. The majority of these underwent open cavity operations (modified radical mastoidectomy, radical mastoidectomy or atticotomy). The incidence of residual disease was only 6 per cent and overall 70 per cent of ears have been free of chronic discharge. The post-operative hearing thresholds were disappointingly low, though overall no worse than those recorded before surgery. The mean post-operative hearing level for the group was 39 dB and the mean air-bone gap was 29 dB. Open cavity surgery is the method of choice for childhood cholesteatoma, mainly because of the low incidence of residual disease.

T1  - Problems in diagnosis and treatment of cholesteatoma in children
AB  - Our clinical study includes 56 cases of cholesteatoma in children aged 3-14 years, treated in a 6-year period. Cholesteatoma was localized in attic (6 cases), in middle ear (6 cases), in attic plus middle ear (16 cases) and in attic + middle ear + mastoid (28 cases or 50% of the total number). In the surgical treatment combined approach tympanoplasty (intact canal wall technique) was used in 76.8%, radical tympanomastoidectomy in 16.1%, and other techniques in 7.1%. Intact ossicular chain was found in 25%. Reconstruction of the ossicular chain (including autograft, homograft and allograft material) was done in 59%, and the remaining 16% were treated by classic radical surgery. Hearing results: unchanged, 48%; improved, 45%; slightly worsened, 7%; and no dead ear. Recurrency in 31% is considerably higher as compared to 15% in adults found in another comparable study by us.

T1  - Long-term results of open cavity and tympanomastoid surgery of the chronic ear
AB  - The results of surgery for chronic middle ear infection in 307 patients (347 ears) are reported. All ears were operated on according to one of two procedures: (i) the operative cavity was left open after removal of the posterior canal wall, or (ii) a tympanomastoidectomy with intact canal wall was done. When necessary, removal of disease in the tympanum with or without reconstruction of the sound-conducting mechanism of the middle ear was performed. Cholesteatoma was present in 56% of the ears. Open cavity surgery with no reconstruction was done in 53%. In the remaining 47%, tympanomastoidectomy was performed and in approx. half of these ears reconstruction was undertaken. The postoperative follow-up period averaged 9 years. Residual cholesteatoma was found in 9%. In 4% of the ears undergoing tympanomastoidectomy a retraction pocket cholesteatoma developed. During the follow-up period 13% of the ears required revision surgery. Nineteen per cent of the ear with open cavities were discharging and, in addition, crusts were observed in 13%. In the tympanomastoidectomy group, discharing ears were seen in 26%. As a rule, hearing was not affected by surgery. The mean elevation of the pure tone threshold was 6.5 dB on account of sensorineural loss, while the speech reception threshold shift was 11 dB. The results testify to the importance of removing the posterior canal wall in ears with chronic middle ear infection associated with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Staged surgery in ears with excessive disease of tympanum
AB  - Results regarding tympanic healing and hearing improvement are reported in a series of 84 one-stage operations on the middle ear, using thin silicone elastomer sheeting, and of 76 two-stage operations using temporary filling of the middle ear with paraffin wax, and of ten with silicone elastomer sponge. All epithelium was removed from the tympanic cleft at the primary operation. Staging of the operation gave better hearing results and resulted in fewer adhesive middle ears. Middle ear mucosal biopsies from ears with mucus production around the paraffin showed an increased number of glands and secreting epithelial cells, much as in glue ears. Residual or recurrent cholesteatoma appeared in only 2.4%, which is attributed to resection of the posterior canal wall in cases of cholesteatoma, as contrasted with the intact canal wall technique.

T1  - Acute mastoid abscess and cholesteatoma
AB  - A 10-year review of acute mastoid abscess treated surgically in Belfast revealed a total of 24 cases, 12 of which were found to have an underlying cholesteatoma. The surgical management of these 12 cases is outlined but despite a desire to maintain an intact canal wall, 9 of them to date have ended up with an open cavity. The danger of conservative management and the possible association between acute mastoid abscess and cholesteatoma, especially in developed countries, is stressed.

T1  - Chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma
AB  - Cholesteatoma may arise because of a number of events, but serous otitis media appears to be the precursor in the majority of instances. Whether one enters into conservative, simple excision of the keratotic mass or a more extensive modified radical mastoidectomy or radical exteriorizing procedure will depend upon whether the cholesteatoma is in a very small "pearl-like" mass, confined to a limited area, or whether it is dispersed to the point where total eradication is all but impossible.

T1  - Hearing results after cholesteatoma surgery: the Iowa experience
AB  - This study compared the hearing outcome of canal-up and canal-down mastoidectomies for removal of cholesteatoma in 455 ears. An intact canal wall procedure was performed in 92 patients while the remainder (N = 363) underwent a canal-down operation. The hearing results for both procedures are dependent on the presence of the stapes superstructure. When the stapes superstructure was intact, 52% of the patients with canal-up operations had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The corresponding figure for canal-down cases was 37%. When there was no stapes superstructure, 54% of the canal-up cases and 19% of the canal-down cases obtained a similar ABG closure. Preserving the posterior external auditory canal wall results in slightly better hearing function. However, when the stapes superstructure is intact, the difference in hearing function is not remarkable, and must be weighed against the potential for residual disease or recurrence associated with canal-up procedures.

T1  - Mastoid surgery: effect of retained mucosa on healing
AB  - Variation in the quality of healing in mastoid cavities has never been clearly understood. It is the author's contention that the factor responsible for the wide variation in healing, even though all chronic disease has been removed, is buried mucosa which leads to cystic formation. Over the past 20 years the author has followed the principle of removing all mucosa from the mastoid segment and has been rewarded with dry ears routinely in open cavity surgery. For the past 12 years he has removed cholesteatoma through tympanoplasty and modified radical mastoidectomy. These cases, also, have been consistently free of cavity problems. In the late 50s and early 60s closed cavity operations were tried in radical mastoidectomy, fenestration and tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. Postoperative healing difficulties were encountered then that are similar to those being reported now with intact canal wall operation. No conclusions are drawn in the controversy between open and closed cavity techniques. The observation may be made, nevertheless, that the problems of closed cavity operations have not been solved. It is the thesis of this paper that the main objection to open cavity operations, ie, poor quality of healing, has been resolved.

T1  - Results of mastoid operations in various chronic ear diseases
AB  - A study of mastoid operations undertaken for various chronic middle ear entities, using closed and open techniques, revealed the following: 1. Marsupialized mastoid balls were found less disappointing than often considered; small cavities were dry in 90 percent and large ones in 70 percent of cases. 2. Residual disease (epidermoid cysts) appeared in 27 percent of the CAT-operated ears and in 13 percent when the open technique was employed. 3. Residual disease appeared twice as often when the primary disease involved the tympanic cavity and in young patients than when the attic and mastoid were exclusively involved or in older patients. 4. Residual disease did show up only in epidermoid ("attic") cholesteatomas, but not when the primary pathology was a retraction pocket (sinus tympani) cholesteatoma. 5. Up to 56 percent of the CAT-operated ears showed small, medium, or large retraction pockets. However, only large retraction pockets were of clinical significance. 6. The posterior wall, when preserved, atrophied to an important degree in about a tenth of the cases. 7. Significant atelectasis appeared in about a third of the ears once the membrana tensa was preserved, that is, in CAT or conservative radical operations. 8. About 10 percent of CAT operations performed in children may lead to an episode of acute mastoiditis.

T1  - Endoscopic middle ear and mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma
AB  - INTRODUCTION: To reduce incidence of residual cholesteatoma following ear surgery; and to reduce the need for second look "open" mastoidectomy using endoscopic mastoidotomy. Ten-year retrospective chart review of 249 primary cholesteatoma cases (1994-2004) with a minimum follow-up of two years. The first objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoendoscopy in reducing the incidence of "cholesteatoma remnant" at the time of primary surgery. The second investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of otoendoscopy in reducing the need to open the mastoid cavities during "second look operations".MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endoscopes were used on all cases as an adjunct to standard microscopic methods. Once all visible cholesteatoma was removed with standard microscopic techniques, endoscopes were utilized in order to identify any "remnants" of cholesteatoma. Endoscopes were also employed during revision second look cases in order to allow the evaluation of intact canal wall mastoid cavities without an open Mastoidectomy approach.RESULTS: Endoscopy at time of primary operations revealed a 22% incidence of hidden cholesteatoma "remnants" despite apparent total microscopic eradication in closed cavity cases, and 10% in open cavity patients. Endoscopic removal of cholesteatoma remnants reduced the long term cholesteatoma "residual" to 9.7% in closed cavity patients. Furthermore, endoscopic surgery significantly reduced the need to open the mastoids during second look operations.CONCLUSION: Otoendoscopy is a very effective adjunctive method in ear surgery. It allows significant reduction in cholesteatoma residual rate in both closed cavity and open cavity cases. Furthermore, the great majority of second look mastoids can be evaluated endoscopically and thus avoid an open revision Mastoidectomy.

T1  - Surgery of the 'only hearing ear' with chronic ear disease
AB  - The management of chronic ear disease affecting the only hearing ear is a controversial subject. The relative scarcity of literature on the subject prompted us to prepare a questionnaire which was sent to European and American otologists and to review 19 cases operated at the ENT Clinic of the University of Parma, Italy, and 16 cases operated at The Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, U.S.A. Surgery of cholesteatoma involving the only hearing ear is advised by all the interviewed otologists without exception, even in the presence of a labyrinthine fistula. The cases from the University of Parma were managed as follows: a classic modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 10 cases, a staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty was done in four cases, an open tympanoplasty in three and a radical mastoidectomy in the remaining two cases. The cases from The Baptist Memorial Hospital were managed with an intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) in nine and with an open procedure in seven cases. All the otologists interviewed agreed that surgery of the only hearing ear requires particular attention and experience, and should be performed with extreme care by a very experienced surgeon.

T1  - The surgical management of childhood cholesteatoma
AB  - The results of treatment of 124 cases of childhood cholesteatoma are reported in the present study and compared with an adult group of patients. Intact canal wall tympanoplasty was performed in over 90 per cent of cases in children and the procedure was staged in nearly 80 per cent of cases. The children had a 43.8 per cent incidence of residual cholesteatoma and an 8.8 per cent incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma in intact canal wall tympanoplasty cases. Intact canal wall tympanoplasty remains the technique of choice in our hands for the treatment of childhood cholesteatoma; pre-planned staging of the operation is mandatory for the detection and elimination of residual cholesteatoma which occurs more frequently in children.

T1  - Closed versus open technique in the management of labyrinthine fistulae
AB  - A labyrinthine fistula is the most common complication of cholesteatomatous chronic ear disease. Its treatment remains a controversial subject. The present paper reports our approach to the management of this complication. Operations were performed on 1,226 cases of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma between January 1971 and December 1985. A labyrinthine fistula was detected in 158 cases. We favor intact canal wall tympanoplasty even in the presence of medium or large fistulas: in the latter case, the matrix is not removed but is trimmed to cover only the bony defect and it is left in place. Open procedures with the preservation of the matrix over the fistula are done in an only-hearing ear with fistula, in ears with a wide defect of the posterior canal wall, and in ears with multiple labyrinthine fistulas. The management of the matrix over the fistula and the anatomic and functional results following each type of procedure are presented and discussed.

T1  - Tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy: present status
AB  - There are many problem areas in tympanoplasty surgery. For the most part the extent of the problems relates directly to how vigorously one pursues a good functional result: the harder the surgeon tries, the more problems he may have. There are also many controversial areas in tympanoplasty, most of which relate to technique. In regard to tympanic membrane grafting and management of the sound pressure transfer mechanism, how well the surgeon performs the operation is far more important than which of the variety of techniques he uses. In relation to obtaining an air-containing mucous membrane-lined middle ear space and the management of the mastoid, there are many philosophical and emotional factors. There are many ways to manage the mastoid in cholesteatoma surgery, all of which can be successful if properly performed. We use all procedures but prefer the intact canal wall technique. The major advantage of the intact canal wall procedure is that the surgeon may avoid a post-operative mastoid cavity. The main disadvantages of this technique are the problems of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma, problems that necessitate a two-stage procedure in the majority of patients.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: management of the labyrinthine fistula--a report of 97 cases
AB  - Preoperative, operative and postoperative findings in 97 cases of labyrinthine fistula are presented. Most of these patients had had symptoms of chronic otitis media for 20 years or more and manifested some degree of sensorineural hearing impairment. Two-thirds had experienced dizziness. The fistula was limited to the lateral semicircular canal in 83 cases and involved the labyrinth more extensively in 14 instances. The intact canal wall technique was used in less than 60% and an open cavity technique in 25% of the cases. Severe or total sensorineural hearing impairment developed postoperatively in 8% of the lateral canal cases and in over half of the extensive fistula cases. Five percent had incapacitating dizziness for up to six months postoperatively. When a labyrinthine fistula is encountered in an only hearing ear we usually recommend a classical modified radical mastoidectomy. In other instances the procedure performed will vary with the status of the opposite ear, the extent of the fistula, the sensorineural function of the involved ear and the size of the mastoid.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery: residual and recurrent disease. A review of 1,024 cases
AB  - This is an analysis of 1,024 primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma operated upon during a ten-year period at the Otologic Medical Group, Inc. Our philosophy of management of the mastoid in these cases has been as follows: 1) avoid an open mastoid cavity when possible; 2) perform the operation in two stages if necessary; 3) reexplore the mastoid and middle ear for residual cholesteatoma when indicated. One-third of 380 revised cases had residual cholesteatoma, disease left by the surgeon. In 260 cases in which the surgeon felt it unlikely that there was residual disease he found it in 23%. In 4% this residual cholesteatoma was found in the mastoid. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was higher in children and in planned, as opposed to unplanned, revisions. Residual cholesteatoma was detected in the middle ear more frequently than in the epitympanum, and in the epitympanum more frequently than the mastoid. Indications for, and timing of, the reexploration are discussed. Recurrent cholesteatoma refers to a retraction pocket and must be differentiated from residual cholesteatoma; the causes, prevention and treatment are different. Recurrent cholesteatoma was detected in 5%. The most common complication of the disease was a labyrinthine fistula (10%). Operative facial nerve damage occurred in one case. The most common postoperative complication was graft failure (3%). Intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy should be performed as a two-stage procedure in most cases when used in the treatment of aural cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - The results of surgery in 266 cholesteatomatous ears were analyzed. In most cases the canal down technique was used. The mean follow-up period was 6.0 years. The incidence of postoperative cholesteatoma was 6%, which is significantly lower than the incidence of residual and/or recurrent cholesteatoma following intact canal wall tympanoplasty reported by several other authors. The canal down technique seems to be superior to the canal up technique in the management of large cholesteatomas.

T1  - Some considerations on middle ear cholesteatoma in 'foreign workers'
AB  - UNLABELLED: The treatment of cholesteatoma in patients without a permanent residence or in medically underdeveloped countries presents a serious problem in middle ear surgery. Methods which erradicate disease safely and reduce the risk of recurrence to a minimum are necessary. We differentiate 3 clinical types of cholesteatoma: 1 Retraction of Shrapnell's membrane or in the postero-superior quadrant with very little cholesteatoma lateral to the ossicles. A transcanal technique is used to evert the cholesteatomatous pocket into the meatus intact, followed by reconstruction of the outer attic wall. 2 Circumscribed cholestatoma lateral and often also medial to the ossicles. Combined approach tympanoplasty is used in such cases. 3 Marginal perforations with large cholesteatomas, situated medial to the ossicular chain. For these ears, classical radical mastoidectomy is the method of choice. (Radical mastoidectomy also has to be performed in all cases of type II, where luxation of the matrix in toto has failed.)RESULTS: No recurrence has been detected in cases where follow-up was possible.

T1  - Identification of risk factors for residual cholesteatoma in children and adults: a retrospective study on 110 cases of revision surgery
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Residual disease after cholesteatoma removal is still a challenge for the otorhinolaryngologist. Scheduled "second-look" surgery and, more recently, radiological screenings are used to identify residual cholesteatoma as early as possible. However, these procedures are cost-intensive and are accompanied by discomfort and risks for the patient.OBJECTIVE: To identify anamnestic, clinical, and surgery-related risk factors for residual cholesteatoma.METHODS: The charts of 108 patients, including children as well as adults, having undergone a second-look or revision surgery after initial cholesteatoma removal at a tertiary referral hospital, were analyzed retrospectively.RESULTS: Gender, age, mastoid pneumatization, prior ventilation tube insertion, congenital cholesteatoma, erosion of ossicles, atticotomy, resection of chorda tympani, different reconstruction materials, and postoperative otorrhea did not emerge as statistically significant risk factors for residual disease. However, prior adenoid removal, cholesteatoma growth to the sinus tympani and to the antrum and mastoid, canal-wall-up 2 ways approach, and postoperative retraction and perforation were associated with a statistically higher rate of residual disease. A type A tympanogram as well as canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach for extended epitympanic and for extended epitympanic and mesotympanic cholesteatomas were associated with statistically lower rates of residual disease. A score including the postoperative retraction or perforation of the tympanic membrane, the quality of the postoperative tympanogram and the intraoperative extension of the cholesteatoma to the sinus tympani and/or the antrum was elaborated and proved to be suitable for predicting residual cholesteatoma with acceptable sensitivity and high specificity.CONCLUSION: Cholesteatoma extension to the sinus tympani, antrum and mastoid makes a residual disease more likely. The canal-wall-down plus reconstruction 2 ways approach seems safe with similar rates of residual cholesteatoma and without the known disadvantages of canal-wall-down surgery. The described score can be useful for identifying patients who need a postoperative radiological control and a second-look surgery.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric patient
AB  - A review of patients with cholesteatoma at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 1981 to 1986 yielded 161 children. Analysis of data from both outpatient and hospital charts revealed a higher incidence of males to females, and the peak incidence of cholesteatoma appeared to be in the 6-10 year age group. Otorrhea was the most common symptom; and on physical examination, the posterior-superior quadrant was most often affected. Both intact canal wall and open cavity procedures were employed depending upon the site and extent of disease. Seventy-six percent of patients underwent an intact canal wall or middle ear procedure initially, with the remainder requiring an open cavity procedure. Recurrent or residual cholesteatoma was found in 32% of 148 patients at the second procedure, and in 7% of 148 patients if a third procedure was necessary. Pre- and post-operative audiometric findings for 91 patients revealed 21% with decreased hearing post-surgically, 50% with no change in hearing and 29% with improved hearing. Post-operative complications were minimal.

T1  - Intact bridge tympanomastoidectomy versus closed procedures
AB  - Intact bridge tympano mastoidemtomy or combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT) has been described quite a few years back and recommended by many, but conventional open techniques of mastoidectomy are still quite popular and so the pendulum of surgery swings between these procedures dividing the surgeons loyalty to each one of them. Though it is quite evident that total eradication of the disease making a dry safe ear with tympanoplastic procedures is simple and achievable in open techniques as compared to closed techniques, the results have been gratifying to date in comparison to the classical intact wall tympano mastoidectomy, this one stage operation avoids cost, discomfort of second stage surgery and hearing results have also been comparable if not improved.

T1  - Middle ear cholesteatoma and its complications
AB  - Objective: Cholesteatoma is still one of the most challenging ear diseases, its evolution leading sometimes to serious complications (facial palsy, vestibular disorders, meningitis, intracranial abscesses, sigmoid sinus thrombosis, etc). Surgical treatment is always required to heal the disease. Method(s): We reviewed the surgical reports of 534 patients treated in the ENT Clinic from Cluj between 2003 to 2010. Patients' ages ranged from 3 to 81 years, with a mean age of 30 years. The surgical procedure was to follow the cholesteatoma extension from the tympanic cavity to the mastoid cavity. Result(s): Most of the cases were operated in closed technique. We have used for ossicular reconstruction incus body without osteitis, the head of the malleus, and cortical of temporal bone. For tympanic membrane and canal wall reconstruction we have used perichondrium cartilage with or without perichondrium. Patients with complications underwent open technique. Recurrence of suppuration was noticed in 28% of cases, requiring a second intervention. Hearing improvement was obtained in 58% of patients, satisfactory results were obtained in 19% of patients, and 23% of patients showed no improvement of hearing. Conclusion(s): Autologous materials remain a useful alternative for middle ear reconstruction, improving the hearing in most of the cases. The treatment in cholesteatoma is always surgical, requiring a careful removal of the infection. The surgical technique should be individualized from case to case.

T1  - Cholesteatoma: Long-term follow-up in romanian patients
AB  - Objective: Cholesteatoma is an abnormal destructive growth of squamous epithelium in middle ear and mastoid. The presence of cholesteatoma requires surgical intervention and the main goal is to achieve a safe, dry ear and to improve hearing. The extension of surgery depends on the size of the cholesteatoma. Method(s): A total of 875 patients were treated for cholesteatoma in our department between 2001 and 2010, 213 pediatric patients. We performed both open and closed and technique, depending on disease extension, bone erosion, and complications, followed by second-look surgery in most of the closed-technique cases. Result(s): The closed technique was the treatment of choice in 69.2% cases, most of them uncomplicated cholesteatomas. In 30.6% we performed open technique for different reasons. Second look surgery was done in 57.3% of cases after 1.5 or 2 years. A total of 27.1% of patients were lost to the follow-up program after the first years. Residual cholesteatomas were noticed in 17% of the cases and the recurrent cholesteatomas were operated in 32% of the cases. After surgery the air-bone gape improved in 67.1% of the cases because of tympanoplasty with autologous graft or different types of prosthesis. In some cases we used the BAHA prosthesis. Conclusion(s): Cholesteatoma is a serious condition which needs surgical treatment. Second-look control in closed technique should be done after one-one and a half year. Closed technique is recommended in order to restore the function of the ear which is very important for a proper development and a good quality of life.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery of the middle ear: reflections on recurrences
AB  - The frequency of recurrences (40%-60%) found during follow-up of closed technique for cholesteatoma surgery suggests that this technique should be systematically carried out in two stages. The greater frequency of recurrence in children indicates the necessity for revision surgery when the closed technique has been used. Where for some reason this cannot be undertaken, the open technique should be chosen at the outset. In case of revision, the safety offered by the closed technique is comparable with that obtained by the open technique and the rate of recurrence would be less than 5%.

T1  - Surgical techniques and results in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - A review of 349 patients with cholesteatoma operated between 1980 and 1995 was done. Of 349 patients, 272 cases had documented follow-up for 1 year or longer and were included in the study which consists of the incidence of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma. The most appropriate surgical technique was performed for each individual case. The surgical techniques were placed in two groups. Open cavity technique: 120 radical mastoidectomy, 26 modified radical mastoidectomy; closed technique: 113 intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy, 13 planned two stage procedure. Recurrence rates were 7.5% with open technique and 11.1% with closed technique. Residive rates were 9.6% with open technique and 5.5% with closed technique. Total failure rate was 17% with open technique and 16.6% with closed technique. The mean follow-up period was 30 months. In our series, there was no significant difference in the incidence and total failure rate of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma between open cavity and closed cavity techniques (p > 0.05).

T1  - A new external canal wall-preserving method for aural cholesteatoma surgery - The osteocutaneous flap
AB  - There are three major results of successful aural cholesteatoma surgery. They are called cavity opened, cavity obliterated and cavity closed (Table 1). Cavity opened or cavity closed, call for the use of canal wall down (CWD) or canal wall up (CWU), respectively. With an obliterated cavity, either the canal wall down or canal wall up method may be used. An intermediate form for management of the canal wall is called temporary CWD and two methods of this form have been used. One is the temporary posterosuperior canal wall resection method and the other is the one the author describes here, the osteocutaneous flap for wall preservation (Fig. 1). The author used this method after deciding to cut down the canal wall in the case of difficult removal of cholesteatoma in the epitympanum or the middle ear recesses under the CWU procedure. In fifteen cases in the past 2 years this method has been used to complete operations which initially began with the CWU procedure. The results included short healing time, less post-operation care, fair hearing recovery and optimal conditions for a smooth and safe 2nd operation. The osteocutaneous flap method gives us one more choice in the many different methods of cholesteatoma surgery.

T1  - Meeting medical expectations in pediatric cholesteatoma surgery-revisited
AB  - Learning Objectives: to establish realistic expectations in pediatric cholesteatoma in the era of non-EPI-diffusion weighted MRI. Introduction: Cholesteatoma is a struggle for a safe and convenient condition with the least possible surgeries in the presence of a disease that tends to re-create after complete removal due to the compromised ME physiology, as well as the possibility of residual disease. Method(s): Data collected from consecutive pediatric cholesteatoma surgeries performed by a single surgeon (ML) between 2001 and 2005 and between 2011 and 2015. Type and number of surgeries performed in each group over the follow up period before (2001 and 2005) and after (2011 and 2015) the introduction of non-EPI-diffusion weighted MRI were compared. Revision surgery was also performed in both groups at any point when recurrent cholesteatoma is detected by routine follow-up otoscopy (4-6 weeks, 3 m, and every 6 m thereafter). Result(s): There were no significant medical or surgical complications in either group. 54.5% of the children operated between 2001-2005 ended with a CWD mastoidectomy condition (radical cavity) after a mean follow up of 5.8 +/- 3.8. None of the children operated during 2011-2015, after the introduction of routine periodic post-operative non-EPI diffusion MRI follow-up ended at this point or expected to have at any point a radical mastoidectomy. Conclusion(s): Currently, radical mastoidectomy with meatoplasty should not be used as one of the routine surgical options in pediatric cholesteatoma. Follow up (clinical and imaging) after cholesteatoma is absolutely mandatory, without it, children with cholesteatoma are exposed to a very significant and unnecessary risk. In cases of repeated, de-novo re-creation of cholesteatoma, or repeated infection in an existing radical cavity, a CWD mastoidectomy with blind sac obliteration of the EEC and the ME cleft is also a very practical option in certain cases, as it eliminates denovo re-creation of cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in children: Actual situation
AB  - Learning Objectives: Cholesteatoma surgery is always in the edge for different decisions but when the disease takes place in children the situation is critical in many instances; preservation of hearing, surgical approach, surgical technique and diagnostic tools. We will be presenting you, based upon our experience, the actual situation that cholesteatoma in children faces regarding diagnosis, surgical approach and results. 68 consecutive cases of cholesteatoma in children have been studied 71% underwent a closed technique and 29% an open thecnique. The most frequent clincal symptom was otorrhea and hearing loss (54%) followed by otorrhea (28%). 50% of the cases had an attical perforation and 26% a posterior marginal perforation. 83% of the cases had an sclerotic or diploic mastoid. The contralateral ear was normal in 70% of the cases. In the cases of cholesteatoma the mucosa was hiperplasic or polipoid in 92%. Cholesteatoma extended to attic in 79%, antrum 58%, posterior recces 38% and to mastoid 23%. The ossicles where damaged in 92% of the cases, being the incus the most frequently involved (70%). Residual or recurrent cholesteatoma appeared in 37% of the cases of closed surgery and 12% of the cases of open surgery. Recurrence of the cholesteatoma took place between 1 and 2 years postsurgery in 75% of the cases. A critical review of the literature is made regarding diagnostic tools, recurrences in relation with open or closed techniques, functional results and a discussion about wether to perform single or second look surgery in closed techniques.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the pediatric age group
AB  - The diagnosis and management of cholesteatoma in children remains controversial. In the past 15 years, the senior author (S.C.P.) has treated 320 patients with cholesteatoma. Patients 18 years and younger composed 40% (125) of the overall group and are the basis for this report. The patient data were compiled using the history, physical examination, audiograms, radiographs, patient questionnaires, surgical findings, and postoperative observations. The surgical treatment selected was determined by the extent of disease, the configuration of the mastoid, and a clinical assessment of eustachian tube function. A middle ear tympanotomy approach was used in 17% of the patients, a canal wall up procedure in 31%, and a canal wall down procedure in 52.3%. The average clinical follow-up was 3.9 years, with the range being from 3 months to 13.5 years. Hearing was maintained or slightly improved in a majority of cases. Residual disease occurred in 8% of patients, and recurrent disease in only 3%.

T1  - Recurrent and residual disease in cholesteatoma surgery
AB  - This is an analysis of 1024 primary cases of mastoid surgery for cholesteatoma operated upon during a 10-year period at the Otologic Medical Group, Inc. Our philosophy of management of the mastoid in these cases has been as follows: avoid an open mastoid cavity when possible; perform the operation in 2 stages if necessary; re-explore the mastoid and middle ear for residual cholesteatoma when indicated. One third of 380 revised cases had residual cholesteatoma, disease left by the surgeon. In 260 cases in which the surgeon felt it unlikely that there was residual disease he found it in 23%. In 4% this residual cholesteatoma was found in the mastoid. The incidence of residual cholesteatoma was higher in children and in planned, as opposed to unplanned, revision. Residual cholesteatoma was detected in the middle ear more frequently than in the epitympanum, and in the epitympanum more frequently than the mastoid. Indications for, and timing of, the re-exploration are discussed. Recurrent cholesteatoma refers to a retraction pocket and must be differentiated from residual cholesteatoma; the causes, prevention and treatment are different. Recurrent cholesteatoma was detected in 5%. The commonest complication of the disease was a labyrinthine fistula (10%). Operative facial nerve damage occurred in one case. The commonest postoperative complication was graft failure (3%). Intact canal wall tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy should be performed as a 2-stage procedure in most cases when used in the treatment of aural cholesteatoma.

T1  - Cholesteatoma surgery at the Otologic Medical Group: Residual and recurrent disease. A report on 307 revision operations
AB  - This article is based on our reports at the International Cholesteatoma Conference, in Tel Aviv, March 1981. Included are a review of the evolution of the intact canal wall techique at the Otologic medical Group and a detailed review of the findings at planned and unplanned revisions. We are currently using the intact canal wall procedure in 75 percent of our surgical procedures for cholesteatoma and obliteration technique in 20 percent, and leaving the cavity exteriorized in 5 percent. Seventy-five percent of the procedures are staged. Planned revisions were indicated to obtain an ear free of disease and an ear with satisfactory hearing. Residual disease was suspected in half of the revisions but found in only one-fourth. The middle ear was more commonly involved than the epitypanum or mastoid. A satisfactory functional result was obtained in 80 percent. Unplanned revisions were indicated primarily of an unsatisfactory hearing result. Recurrent cholesteatoma was the indication in only fifteen cases. Residual cholesteatoma was uncommon. The key factor in the understanding of the incidence of residual and recurrent disease, and the functional result, is an understanding of the surgeons' philosophy. Surgeons who vigorously pursue a good functional result in all cases face a dilemma, regardless of how they manage the mastoid. The more persistent they are, the more problems they may encounter. A planned two-stage procedure frequently will be necessary to accomplish the dual objectives of tympanoplasty surgery: an ear free of disease and an ear with a good functional result.

T1  - Cholesteatoma in the normal hearing ear
AB  - OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Surgical treatment of cholesteatoma in ears with normal or near-normal hearing represents a challenge, in that complete removal of disease may require sacrifice of the ossicular chain. Our aim was to identify the predictive factors and surgical strategies that favor hearing preservation in these patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review. METHOD(S): Fifty-four procedures were performed in 50 patients with cholesteatoma and a preoperative speech reception threshold or pure-tone average (PTA) of less than 25 dB. Complete audiometric data were available in 51 cases. All patients had complete surgical removal of cholesteatoma. Whenever feasible, ossicular reconstruction was performed at the time of the initial surgical procedure. RESULT(S): The median PTA changed by -3 dB, and hearing was preserved to within 10 dB of preoperative level in 72% of patients. An intact ossicular chain was found in 72% of the cases and could often be preserved at surgery. However, similar hearing outcomes resulted after intact versus reconstructed ossicular chains and in open versus closed mastoidectomies. The recidivism rate was 26%, and recidivistic cases had worse hearing outcomes. Congenital cholesteatomas and Prussak space cholesteatomas had better outcomes with respect to hearing preservation and recidivism. CONCLUSION(S): Cholesteatoma in the normal hearing ear should be treated with the same surgical priorities as all other cholesteatomas. Preventing recidivism has a significant effect on hearing preservation, whereas preserving an intact ossicular chain and maintaining an intact canal wall do not. © The American Laryngological, Rhinological & Otological Society, Inc.

T1  - Principles of cholesteatoma surgery. [German, English]
AB  - As a potentially life-threatening disease, cholesteatoma of the petrous bone generally requires a surgical approach. Surgery aims to produce an ear that is easy to care for and is free of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. Hearing improvement is of secondary importance. Nevertheless the sound conduction system is generally reconstructed as a single-stage procedure. There are various possible methods of dealing with a cholesteatoma: (i) preserving or reconstructing the posterior meatal wall with an aerated mastoid (closed technique) or obliteration of the mastoid completely or partially after removal of the posterior wall (closed technique); and (ii) leaving the cavity open for inspection (open technique). In our opinion any technique where the mastoid is not open for inspection should be called a closed technique. Both techniques have their specific advantages and disadvantages. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

T1  - Labyrinthine fistula and tympanoplasty
AB  - Three interdependent problems have to be solved by a surgeon in each case of middle ear cholesteatoma with a fistula of the horizontal canal: whether the matrix can be safely removed from fistula or should be left in place; if the matrix is removed, whether the fistula should be covered or not and, in the positive case, by which kind of graft; and whether closed or open tympanoplasty should be performed. In well selected cases the matrix can be safely removed from the fistula and some technique of closed tympanoplasty used. Suitable for this type of surgery are cases of superficial fistula of the horizontal canal, with preservation of the endosteal membrane, where complete removal of the matrix from the tympanic cavity is possible. Very poor hearing and obvious middle ear infection are apparent contraindications. Furthermore, this type of surgery should not be performed on a better hearing ear. If any difficulty in removal of the matrix from the fistula is encountered, the matrix should be left in place. Fistula cases which do not fulfill these criteria should be treated either by open tympanoplasty or by modified radical mastoidectomy, leaving the matrix on the fistula. A small series of five consecutive fistula cases treated by closed tympanoplasty, using intact wall technique or reconstruction of the bony canal wall, with removal of the matrix from the fistula, leaving it bare, is reported after a follow up of three to six years. The results indicate that, in selected fistula cases, this type of surgery seems to bring favorable late hearing results and to create good conditions for closure of the fistula, apparently not presenting any risk to the inner ear.

T1  - Epidemiologic profile of patients with chronic ear in otology service medical of otorrinolaringolgy residency at Feira Santana/Ba
AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media (COM) is a process of inflammatory nature of middle ear and mastoid with or without a tympanic membrane perforation and otorrhea, potentially leading to a conductive or mixed hearing loss. It is estimated that over 20 million people worldwide suffer from COM. The COM can be divided into two groups: simple and suppurative. The latter group is subdivided into noncholesteatomatous (COMNC) and cholesteatomatous (CCOM). The "radical mastoidectomy" surgery is indicated for these cases and constitutes in cleaning and clearing of the mastoid and posterior and superior bony wall of the external auditory canal. Methodology: Study was conducted prospectively with patients COMNC, CCOM and underwent surgery in a medical residency in otolaryngology in Feira de SantanaBA during the period between 2008 and 2014. We monitored the patients for 8 months postoperatively. Result(s): The following surgeries were proposed: radical mastoidectomy (MR), tympanomastoidectomy (TM), and tympanoplasty (TP), 304 surgeries being performed. Among these, 152 were TM, TP 64, and 88 MR. There was a predominance of females in all types of surgeries. The improvement in hearing was assessed subjectively with significant hearing improvement. Discussion(s): The data obtained in this study confirm the benefit of surgery in the treatment of chronic otitis media. Conclusion(s): Other studies correlating both subjective and objective improvement of hearing in the evaluation of patients with chronic otitis media undergoing surgery are needed.

T1  - Functional middle ear and mastoid surgery (FMMS)
AB  - Objective: To present a new surgical concept, functional middle ear and mastoid surgery (FMMS), which is aimed to improve the results of chronic ear surgery in the 21st century. Setting: Tertiary Care Center Study Design: Clinical Prospective Study. Methods: A surgical roadmap, based on a new clinico-radiological staging system (TMC) of middle ear cholesteatoma, is outlined. Patients: 120 patients of tympanomastoid cholesteatoma were included in this study. They were preoperatively staged, operated by (FMMS) system, followed up and results reported. Results: Anterior tympanotomy was done in all the cases. Intact canal wall mastoidectomy was done in 79 percent, while open mastoidectomy was performed in 11 percent, and no mastoidectomy was required in 10 percent of the cases. Residual and recurrent cholesteatoma was found in 6.7 percent (6/95) of cases, all after Intact canal wall (ICW) mastoidectomy.The overall (n=120) pre- and post-operative (at least 12 months after surgery) four frequency PTA-AB6 were 33.40 ± 7.22 dB and 12.42 ± 5.6 dB. Conclusions: Due to the changing trends in the presentations of chronic ear disease, as well as the advances in its diagnosis and treatment, FMMS presents a logical surgical solution for tympano-mastoid cholesteatoma in the 21st century It stresses the fact that the middle ear should be the primary target of otosurgeons to clear pathology and reconstruct the hearing mechanism. Mastoidectomy is performed, only if necessary, to approach the middle ear posteriorly and to clear pathology extensions if needed.

T1  - Tympanomastoidectomy: Comparison between canal wall-down and canal wall-up techniques in surgery for chronic otitis media
AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media (COM) is an inflammatory condition associated with otorrhea as well as large and persistent perforations of the tympanic membrane in some cases. COM can also lead to cholesteatoma. Surgical treatment with canal walldown and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy is considered for both types of illness. The choice of technique is controversial and is dependent on several factors, including the extent of disease. Objective: We aimed to evaluate surgical outcomes in COM patients with and without cholesteatoma treated with canal walldown and canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy. Disease eradication and post-operative auditory thresholds were assessed. Method: Patient records from the otorhinolaryngology department of a tertiary hospital were assessed retrospectively. Results: Patients who underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy had a higher rate of revision surgery, especially those with cholesteatoma. However, there were no statistically significant differences in post-operative hearing thresholds between the two techniques. Conclusion: The canal wall-down technique is superior to the canal wall-up technique, especially for patients with cholesteatoma.

T1  - Retrospective analysis of the middle ear diseases operated
AB  - The clinical records of 223 patients of the middle ear diseases, excluding the malignant tumors, operated on at the Department of Otolaryngology of University of Tsukuba Hospital from March 1988 to March 1998 were reviewed. Two hundred and seventy-six ears underwent the ear surgeries, including 8 of staged surgery and 23 of revision. The majority of patients (132 ears; 47.8%) were diagnosed as chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, and 58, 40 and 12 ears were diagnosed as chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, ossicular fixation or discontinuity and otosclerosis, respectively. Myringoplasty, tympanoplasty, stapes sugery, radical mastoidectomy and others were performed in 17, 202, 25, 18 and 14 ears, respectively. Columellization from the head of stapes was performed in 104 ears and from the footplate in 26 ears. Of the 188 ears, a trimmed tragal cartilage were used in 154 ears for the reconstruction of the ossicular chain and an artificial ossicular reconstructive prosthesis (PORP or TORP) was used in 28 ears. The overall success rate as to an improved hearing was 81.8%; there was no significant difference between the cases of chronic otitis media with (78.4%) and without cholesteatoma (78.0%), nor between the intact canal (88.0%) and canal down (75.3%) cases operated on for the surgical treatment in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. © 1999, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo.

T1  - A Study of Middle Ear Surgery —Conducted in the Past Few Years—
AB  - The outcome of operations on 68 ears, which we performed between 1986 and 1988 was reviewed. We carried out pure-tone audiometory in these cases. Surgery was done for cholesteatoma in 44.1%; for chronic suppurative otitis media in 55.9%; and for the second time in 11.8%. Especially 8.8% had both operations done by us. Thirty two ears underwent intact canal wall tympanoplasty; 30 ears, classical tympanoplasty; and 6 ears, radical mastoidectomy. Postoperatively hearing was improved in 52.5 % of the ears in which the tymponoplasty was carried out. © 1989, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology. All rights reserved.

T1  - Recent Trends in Surgery of Chronic Otitis Media
AB  - Purpose of the present study is to learn the recent trends in surgery of chronic otitis media, particularly of cholesteatoma, in various areas of the world by sending questionnaires to otologic surgeons in the US, Europe and Japan.<BR>This study which was confined to those cases operated on during the year of 1977 revealed that:<BR>1. Frequency of mastoidectomy in non-cholesteatoma while it was over 60% in Japan.<BR>2. The homograft tympanic membrane is used more frequently in Europe than in the US.<BR>3. Frequency of radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 11% in Europe, 18% in the US and 21% in Japan.<BR>4. The frequency of modified radical mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 26% in the US, 23% in Europe and 15% in Japan.<BR>5. The frequency of tympanoplasty.without mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 13% in the US and Europe while it was 6% in Japan.<BR>6. Frequency of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesteatoma cases was 43% in the US, 53% in Europe and 58% in Japan.<BR>7. In the US and Japan the frequency of tympanoplasty with removal (without reconstruction) of the posterior canal wall was about 45% to 50% of all tympanoplaty cases for cholesteatoma while it was 29% in Europe.<BR>8. Reconstruction after removal of posterior canal wall in tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma was more frequent in Europe than in the US or in Japan.<BR>9. In intact canal wall technique for cholesteatoma, it is a recent trend in the US and Europe that a greater number of tympanoplasty are performed as staged operation. © 1979, Society of Oto-rhino-laryngology Tokyo.

T1  - A Long-Term Follow-Up Study of Middle Ear Surgery —Conducted in the 11 years from 1968 to 1978—
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of the long-term follow up of the 325 ears operated upon during the 11 years from 1968 to 1978. According to the 166 patients who answered our questionnaire, ear discharge was complained of in 45 percent of the cases and hearing deterioration in 65 percent thereof. In a total of 115 ears, on which we were able to carry out otoscopic examination and pure-tone audiometry, 49 percent underwent surgery for cholesteatoma; 42 percent, for chronic supperative otitis media; 4 percent, for tuberculosis of the middle ear; and 5 percent received surgery a second time on the middle ear. Of those, 46 ears underwent intact canal wall tympanoplasty; 32 ears, classical tympanoplasty; 19 ears, modified radical mastoidectomy; and 18 ears, radical mastoidectomy. Recurrence of perforation of the reconstructed ear drum was found in 44.7 percent and recurrence of ear discharge was present in 43 percent of the total; in 61 percent of the ears that had received radical mastoidectomy, in 47 percent of those with modified radical mastoidectomy in 56 percent of those with classical tympanoplasty and in 24 percent of those with intact canal wall tympanoplasty. Long-term hearing results were unsatisfactory; only 18.4 percent of the patients experienced improvement in postoperative hearing but postoperative hearing was depressed in 40 percent of the cases. © 1981, The Society of Practical Otolaryngology.

T1  - Preservation of labyrinth and facial function in extensive cholesteatoma
AB  - Surgery for cholesteatoma is a challenge, especially in extensive cholesteatomas with invasion around the facial nerve and the labyrinth. Presence of facial weakness, vertigo and deafness together with chronic discharge from the ear usually indicates a more advanced disease. One hundred and twenty ears with cholesteatoma were reevaluated; in seventy-two patients an open technique was used and in forty-eight a closed technique. In two patients there was a preoperative facial paresis and one suffered from facial tics preoperatively. The facial function was more frequently deranged in patients with labyrinth erosion than in patients without. In the group of patients where the labyrinth was involved the bone conduction remained unchanged postoperatively, except for a few patients where a slight improvement was noted at frequencies of 500 and 2000 Hz. The improvement of bone conduction in some of the patients is probably dependent on recovery of the inner ear mechanism. A rather high proportion of fistulae patients had an exposed facial nerve and or a preoperative facial dysfunction, which, however, returned to normal postoperatively. As a conclusion, ears with cholesteatoma combined with labyrinthine symptoms are more frequently associated with a dehiscent facial nerve than other ears and disturbed facial function is then more common. During surgery it is important to be aware of the risk of an uncovered facial nerve. © 2003, Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
